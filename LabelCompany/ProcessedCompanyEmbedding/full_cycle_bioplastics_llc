polyhydroxyalkanoates pha bioplastic using a novel process that utilizes organic and cellulosic waste as the feedstock it is well known that phas harmlessly and naturally degrade in marine and terrestrial ecosystems but commercially available pha is currently made from crop based feedstocks such as food grade sugar or seed oil fcb’s nongmo based process is environmentally friendly from the start using food waste ag byproducts cardboard and waste paper as the raw materials fcb can even utilize pha products at their endoflife as feedstock for the production of virgin pha – a true closedloop system pha produced with fcb’s technology provides consumers a truly sustainable choice by licensing fcb technology companies with large waste streams either as producers ie food processing or collectors ie waste handling can produce pha to generate revenue and mitigate disposal costs thus creating the highest and best value from waste overview — full cycle bioplastics overview full cycle bioplastics converts organic wastes into a biodegradable plastic called polyhydroxyalkanoate pha here’s how nearly any organic waste can be converted into a consistent high value product   step  waste is broken down and becomes feedstock for pha    mixed consortia of wildtype bacteria containing intracellular pha inclusions photo taken at the fcb lab   step once the feedstock is perfectly adjusted it is dosed into an environmentally conditioned tank of naturally occurring bacteria where it is consumed and converted into phathere are no genetically modified organisms gmos used in our process this significantly lowers our production costs and eliminates the need for expensive laboratory grade sterility or containment     pha properties can vary to meet customer needs       step the pha is then dried and processed into a finished resin product ready for compounding full cycle bioplastics full cycle bioplastics we turn organic waste into a fully biodegradable plastic waste haulers

titled “method and apparatus for electromagnetic separation” all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entiretiestechnical fieldthe present disclosure generally relates to a process for the production of bioplastic resins and more specifically to the production of plastic resins from organic waste productsbackgroundplastic resins are used for many products as plastic is moldable and can be tailored to have specific tensile and shear strengths and other materials properties that can be changed based on the material composition for various applications as used herein “resin” generally refers to a polymer or copolymer plastics are often produced from petroleum or other oilbased materials however such plastic products such as water bottles and other packaging items are often not biodegradable and as such are not as reusable or effectively recyclable in terms of cost although petroleumbased plastics are recyclable the cost to recycle these products is high further petroleumbased plastics are increasingly ending up in landfills oceans and other places where ecological damage is becoming an increasing concernbecause of the increased costs of petroleum products and the ecological effects of nonbiodegradable plastics there have been recent attempts at manufacturing biodegradable plastics which are often referred to as “bioplastics” many of these attempts have been accompanied with high cost low recycling yield and other barriers to entry for a bioplastic facility as such the ability of bioplastics to compete with petroleumbased plastics has not yet been fully achievedof particular interest are plastic resins known as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha resins phas combine sufficient biodegradability characteristics with desirable material properties which allow the use of phas in a larger number of applications over other biodegradable plastic materials however one of the barriers to market entry for phas has been the cost of production being tied to the cost of sugar which is used as a raw material for producing phas because the cost of the raw material used to produce pha is subject to many market forces biodegradable phas are often sold at a premium price versus petroleumbased plastics having comparable material properties this price differential has discouraged markets from employing phas on a large scalesummaryin some aspects the

may begin with an input material  which may be subjected to a liquefaction process  liquefied material may then be fermented or otherwise processed in a volatile fatty acid vfa production process  and the fermented input material may then be placed in a solidtoliquid andor liquidtoliquid material separation process  the material separation process  may include physical or chemical separations of

solids in addition to true liquid state substances as will be clear from the present disclosure substances involved in the described processes may undergo various degrees of filtration and may therefore contain any amounts of large or small solids flowing along with liquid materials as such substances or materials referred to as liquids or fluids may include substances that may not necessarily be entirely in a liquid stateofmatter even after filtration or other separation processesin some embodiments the separation process  may be a distillation process a filtration process a centrifugation process a press process or any other chemical or mechanical separation process the separation process  when a distillation process may be applied to a specific input material eg citrus culls to capture essential oils from the input material  other separation processes  may be employed in accordance with different aspects of the present disclosurefor many bioplastics process  may begin with an input material  of a singular material such as sugar eg sucrose canola oil or other homogenous input material the input material  may be referred to as a “biomass” or a “feedstock” where large quantities of sugar or other carbohydrates are present as described previously the cost of sugar in the quantities employed for process  may make the process  prohibitively expensive when compared to other input materials the present disclosure in an aspect may employ a wide range of other input materials  that may contain shortchain soluble carbohydrates such as lactose maltose fructose or other cho derivatives rather than highcost input material the input material  encompassed by the present disclosure may include organic waste products such as food waste agricultural waste or other products such as forestry waste glycerol vinegar or other materials that may be in solid liquid or a mixture of solid and liquid forms in some cases the various example bioplastic production processes described herein may be used with input materials of unknown nonhomogenous or variable compositionsdepending on the type of the input material  that is used in process  the input material may be liquefied andor otherwise processed to facilitate further processing of the input material in later stages of the process  for example if the input material  is in solid or semisolid form the liquefaction process  may convert solid or semisolid input material  into a form that will be more efficiently fermented in the vfa production process  if the input material  is not of a homogeneous nature the liquefaction process  may also homogenize the input material  such that the vfa production process has a uniform effect on the input material  in some embodiments solid input materials may simply be shredded or ground into smaller pieces to allow for mechanical movement of the material through a digester or other process equipmentthe liquefaction process  may begin conversion of the input material into shortchain soluble carbohydrates sugars this may be done through enzyme andor bacterial digestion in any suitable digester such as a batch digester a series of sequence batch digesters a plug flow digester a continuous digester or any combination of these or other digester types further the liquefaction process  may include steps andor components to aid in the filtration of contaminants and separation of liquids from solids that may occur later in the process in an aspect of the present disclosure the input material  may also be mixed with additional material to aid in the liquefaction process  vfa production process  or in other steps or processes used in the overall process  as such in the liquefaction process  other materials such as nutrient enrichments or other additional materials may be added to the input material or intermediate materials to make the remainder of the process  more efficient for the input material  being used various additives nutrient enrichment materials or other inputs may be made to the input material  based on the desired output material  the chemical composition of the input material  the vfa production process  the separation process  andor the bioplastic production process  or other factorsthe vfa production process  may be configured to convert sugars present in the liquefied input material  into acids including vfas in various embodiments the vfa production process  may be done by bacterial fermentation acid phase anaerobic digestion hydrolysis or various combinations of these andor other processes certain bacteria which may be called hydrolytic bacteria may generally be those that perform liquefaction acidogenic bacteria may generally be those that form vfas and acetogenic bacteria may generally be those that produce acetic acid these andor other bacteria may be combined with the liquefied optionally nutrient added input material  in the vfa production process  as the bacteria and sugarladen input material combine they may produce carboxylic acids including vfas for example the bacteria may produce acids such as lactic acid acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid isobutyric acid valeric acid isovaleric acid caproic acid and other carboxylic acids other vfas or other volatile acids depending on the bacteria added in the vfa production processin some cases desired acidogenic bacteria may include wildtype bacteria which are naturally occurring andor not genetically modified bacteria in some embodiments desired acidogenic bacteria may include obligate anaerobes of one or more of the following genera pseudomonas bacillus clostridium micrococcus and flavobacterium such wildtype acidogenic bacteria may be used to anaerobically digest the material in any of the digester the use of wildtype bacteria provides the ability to use nonsterilized conditions for the process  as well as a costeffective approach to the use of digesters many input materials  may also be more efficiently digested using wildtype bacteria than with geneticallymodified bacteriadesired wildtype acidogenic bacteria which may be used in some embodiments of the vfa production process  may be obtained from any available source and then cultured and encouraged by providing conditions that support the desired bacteria and suppress the activity of undesired bacteria in some embodiments desired vfa producing bacteria may generally be mesophilic preferring moderate temperatures and conditions for example desired bacteria may be encouraged by controlling various environmental conditions such as ph aerobic anaerobic cycling carbon to nitrogen ratio feastfamine conditions cycle timing flow rates hydraulic residence time vs solids residence time etc in some embodiments controlling environmental conditions for encouraging desired vfaproducing bacteria may include maintaining a ph of between about  and about  for example in various embodiments the materials processed during the vfa production process may be maintained at a ph of about      or in some embodiments the vfa production process  may include aerobic andor anaerobic digestion anaerobic digestion is a biological process or a collection of processes in which microorganisms break down organic material in the absence of oxygen aerobic digestion is a biological process or a collection of processes in which microorganisms break down organic materials in the presence of oxygen certain bacterial processes may thrive or die depending on the quantity of oxygen present thus in some embodiments the composition of intermediate or output materials may be optimized by controlling the relative amount of aerobic and anaerobic digestion in some embodiments aerobic digestion may be substantially or entirely omitted from the vfa production process  in various embodiments the vfa production process  may include only anaerobic digestion only anaerobic digestion and fermentation or only fermentationthe anaerobic digestion process when used as part of the vfa production process  may include bacterial hydrolysis of the input material  insoluble organic polymers such as carbohydrates that may be present in the input material  may be broken down into soluble byproducts such as sugars that are then available for other bacteria to consume these other bacteria sometimes called “acidogenic” bacteria may then convert the sugars into organic acids andor volatile acids these organic andor volatile acids may then be converted into vfas such as acetic acid or other carboxylic acids such as lactic acid as well as other byproducts such as ammonia hydrogen and carbon dioxide if desired methanogenic archaea may then be allowed to convert these gases and acids into methanein embodiments in which a vfa production process  includes an aerobic digestion process bacteria andor other microorganisms may use oxygen from the surrounding environment aerobic digestion may mainly produce carbon dioxide and water from input material  that is rich in carbon and oxygen if the input material  contains nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur then the aerobic digestion may also produce nitrates phosphates andor sulfatesby controlling the environment temperature types of bacteria used the amount of anaerobic and aerobic digestion and the amount of bacterial fermentation that is done in the vfa production process  the present disclosure may accept a large range of input material  and still produce an output material  with desired properties in a costeffective and efficient manner such parameters may be controlled by controlling environmental parameters during digestion and fermentation processes such as temperature ph dissolved oxygen concentrations rates or degrees of mixing eg by agitation stirring or otherwise ammonianitrogen ratios organic acid concentrations or othersin the separation process  the gaseous products of vfa production process  may be removed and the acid products of vfa production process  may be separated as these acid products are separated each acid product may be refined purified or distilled to obtain one or more acids of desired composition the present disclosure encompasses at least one and perhaps several output slurries or gas flows from the separation process  which may be recombined or may be processed separately depending on the composition of a desired output material in the separation process  the various products of the vfa production process  eg solids liquids and gases may be separated from each other each of the products which may be acid products compost methane or other solid liquid andor gaseous products may then be forwarded to other parts of the process  as neededsome of the separated materials may then be placed in a bioplastic production process  the bioplastic production process  may be configured to create polymer chains from the one or more separated products and may further refine the separated products into various output materials  andor byproductsthe above description with respect to fig a is an overview of a bioplastic formation process  many variations are possible within this general framework of the process  in aspects of the present disclosure reference is made to the process  and which potential portion of the process  such variations may occur in however the present disclosure is not limited to such portions as discussed hereinpha productionin an aspect of the present disclosure a desired output material  may include a material with a high concentration which may be a  to  concentration by dry cell weight of pha although pha may be produced from particular input materials  the present disclosure discusses various systems and processes to produce output materials  having a high concentration of pha from an input material  comprising organic waste products in some cases a desired output material  may include water obtained by separating certain desired output materials  from input materials  and intermediate materials depending on the particular organic waste products used as input material  variations on the process  may be used to produce output materials  having pha with a desired compositionfor example and not by way of limitation a particular input material  may be mixed with additional nutrients or other additives to provide the process  with a feedstock that can produce the desired output material  in this instance pha further depending on the type eg aerobic vs anaerobic the type of bacteria present etc andor time spent in the vfa production process  separation process  and bioplastic production process  the amount of nutrients may be increased or decreased systems and processes provided in the present disclosure may manage the entire process  including the input material  to produce desired output materials  more efficiently for a given input material in an aspect of the present disclosure output materials  may include pha pha in combination with cell mass pha in combination with cell mass and water or other materials further output materials  may include a material that may be further processed to extract pha andor other byproducts either within process  or in a separate processin one embodiment the input material  may be organic waste products such as agricultural and food waste and the vfa production process  may be primarily an acidphase anaerobic digestion which generates vfas further the acidphase anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food waste may produce lactic acid which may also be polymerized into the output material  including pha if desired the lactic acid may be separated from the vfas in the separation process  alternatively lactic acid may be retained in a mixture with the vfas and the lactic acid may be incorporated into the pha copolymer the bioplastic production process  may then be used to produce a pha copolymer from lactate monomers andor hydroxybutyrate and hydroxyvalerate monomers as well as other monomers from the vfassome of the difficulties in related processes when used to produce pha are that the process may be designed for a single homogeneous input material eg sucrose related processes typically do not contemplate using various or nonhomogeneous input materials to produce a consistent pha resin due to the difficulties in controlling such a processthe process  in an aspect of the present disclosure may produce different output materials  in some embodiments output materials  produced by a process  may include a pha biopolymer made up of various component copolymers for example the output material  may comprise a biopolymer containing dry weight quantities of polyhydroxybutyrate phb polyhydroxyvalerate phv and other monomers or materials in desired ratios bioplastics made from pure phb tend to be more stiff and brittle while bioplastics made from pure phv tend to be more elastic therefore depending on the physical characteristics desired of the final product eg the relative stiffness or elasticity of the material a desired output material  may have particular target quantities of phb phv and other components table  provides several examples of pha monomer compositions by dry weight in various embodiments the examples of table  are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting to the scope of the present disclosure composition quantities listed as “” are intended to include compositions with a measurable quantity of the listed component less than  but greater than zerotable pha dry weight monomer compositions hydroxy hydroxy lacticbutyratevalerateacid  in some embodiments the ratio of phb to phv in an output material  produced by the process  may be related to the ratio of specific vfas directed to the bioplastic production process  for example when fed pure  acetic acid phaproducing bacteria in the bioplastic production process  may tend to produce nearly  phb increasing the quantity of propionic acid andor other higherchain vfas ie vfas with more carbon atoms than acetic acid which has two in addition to acetic acid may tend to produce increasing quantities of phv in addition to phb the presence of other acids in various concentrations may also affect the composition of the bioplastic materials producedtherefore in some embodiments the phbphv ratio of an output material  may be controlled by maintaining target concentration ratios of different acids in intermediate materials delivered to the bioplastic production process  further by separating or not separating some of the acids such as lactic acid from the intermediate materials delivered to the bioplastic production process  the production of polylactic acid pla can be inhibited or enhanced in the output material table  provides several example ranges of concentrations of various feedstock acids expressed as mass percents otherwise referred to herein as “weight percent” or “wt ” that may be used in various embodiments of process  each column of table  may represent a separate set of target concentration ratio ranges for a feedstock liquid mixture to be delivered to phaproducing bacteria in order to produce a particular desired output bioplastic product each feedstock acid mixture may contain quantities of a plurality of vfas and some mixtures may contain quantities of lactic acid as described herein wt  of feedstock acids is based on the total weight of carboxylic acids the total weight of vfas and lactic acid or the total weight of vfas in the feedstock in one example when the carboxylic acids in the feedstock consist essentially of vfas and lactic acid the wt  of feedstock acids may be based on the total weight of vfas and lactic acid in another example when the carboxylic acids in the

mixture may have a ratio of wt  of acetic acid to wt  of propionic acid of about  about  about  about  about  about  or about in some embodiments a feedstock liquid may be diluted with water or another solvent to obtain a desired concentration of total vfas per unit volume of feedstock liquid for example if a feedstock liquid contains substantially more vfa mass per unit volume than a desired concentration a dilution solvent may be added to the feedstock liquid until a desired volumetric concentration is reached for example in some embodiments a feedstock liquid to be delivered to a bioplastic production process may be prepared with a target concentration of total vfas of between about  gl and about  gl or between about  gl and about  glprocess variability based on input materialfig b illustrates several variations of the process flow shown in fig a in addition to moving materials directly from one step to the next as shown in fig a the variations of fig b provide the ability to advance materials produced in one process directly to a later process while bypassing one or more intermediate processes some examples of such variations are described below with reference to fig bpath  provides the ability for some or all of an input material  to flow directly to the bioplastic production process  bypassing the intermediate steps of liquefaction fermentation and separation in such a process flow some or all of the input material  is able to be directly polymerized some examples of input materials  that may utilize path  within process  are a pure vfa stream a methanol stream or a sugar stream that can be directed toward the bioplastic production process  rather than going through the remainder of the processes in the process similarly some input materials  may be suitable to bypass the liquefaction process  and the vfa production process  and be directed toward the separation process  via path  for example and not by way of limitation a mixed liquid stream may only need to be separated eg by separating existing liquids from existing solids rather than running the input material  through unnecessary portions of the process  for example an input material  comprising vinegar and oil is already liquefied and already contains the desired materials so liquefaction and fermentation may not be used when processing such input materials which would be directed to path path  may also be used for input materials  that can bypass the liquefaction process  and may be directed to the vfa production process  for example and not by way of limitation some input materials  may already be soluble but fermentation may be used to derive the desired output materials  such an example may be an input material  comprising a solidsfree stream of longchain fatty acids from biodiesel byproducts the longchain fatty acids may then be processed in the vfa production process  to form shortchain fatty acids which may then continue through the rest of the process  another example of an input material  that may utilize path  is a mixed vfa stream from a compost leachatein some embodiments the input material  may substantially comprise a liquid obtained from a composting process such a liquid may be referred to as a compost leachate and may generally contain substantial quantities of longchain fatty acids in aqueous solution such an input material may be sent directly to the vfa production process  via path  the vfa production process may be configured to convert the longchain fatty acids into shorterchain vfas in desired ratiosprocess analysis and feedback controlfig  illustrates a detailed example process flow in an aspect of the present disclosure in some embodiments the composition or makeup of each intermediate product flowing from one subprocess to another may be monitored modified and adjusted this monitoring and adjustment allows the process  to be improved or tailored to a particular input material  for production of a desired output product for example one or more of the liquefaction process  vfa production process  separation process  and bioplastic production process  can be altered or additional materials can be added to the overall process  to produce an output material  with a desired composition andor an output material  having specific desired qualities or characteristicsthe process  of fig  contains several subprocesses and modules which are further described elsewhere in the present disclosure the process  may begin by directing one to three or more input materials eg a b c into a device for performing a liquefaction process  or directly to an input makeup analysis and adjustment module  for performing analysis andor adjustment of the composition or makeup of the input materials a b cas used herein the term “makeup” may refer to any qualitative or quantitative description of one or more input materials intermediate products output products or any other material to be manipulated or produced

concentration of one or more desired or undesired components ratios describing relative concentrations of one or more components etcthe makeup of input materials may be evaluated andor adjusted by the input makeup analysis and adjustment module  depending on the results of the analysis some or all of the input materials may be diverted to other modules for processing andor to be mixed with other materials for improved processing for example if the input makeup module  determines that the input material should be supplemented with additives some or all of the input material may be directed via path  from the input makeup module  to a nutrient additive module  if the input makeup module  determines that the input material is ready for the vfa production process  then some or all of the input material may be directed as vfa production input materials  to a vfa production process module configured to perform a vfa production process  which may include fermentation acid phase digestion andor

processes or tasks the nutrient additive module  may also comprise one or more dosing pumps conduits pipes hoses valves electromechanical actuators configured to transport one or more additives from an additive reservoir eg a tank container bottle etc to process equipment containing an input material or intermediate material to be modified by the additivedosing pumps in any of the various

material has an appropriate makeup that portion of the input material may be directed to a module for performing separation  via path  andor directly to a bioplastic production process step  bypassing the separation step materials exiting the fermentationdigestion process  may be directed to various downstream points depending on the nature of the material and other factors for example liquidsolid

to further break down similar vfarich liquids may be obtained using a digester such as those described in this disclosure or other digesters an example of a mixture of vfas in a leachate obtained from a compost row is provided in table  belowtable example composition of compost leachatequantityquantityvfaglmass aceticpropionicisobutyricbutyricisovalericvaleric the following example is described with reference to several “tanks” in which various processes may be performed the term “tank” is used broadly to refer to any suitable vessel in which a described process may be performed the various “tanks” described herein may also include additional processing equipment such as pumps valves electromechanical actuators control systems conduits pipes agitators or any other device suitable for performing one or more of the process steps described therefore to the extent that the following example refers to the tanks performing various functions the functions may be performed manually eg by manually operated controls or automatically eg by electromechanical control driven by an electronic controller by control systems and devices coupled to the tanks and associated processing equipmentthe example will now be described with reference to the components of the system block diagram of fig  compost leachate liquid  from a composter  may be placed into one or more anaerobic fermentation tanks  which may be referred to herein as a polishing tanks  the polishing tanks  may be configured to receive a solution of mixed soluble acids and using anaerobic bacteria convert the solution to the lowest chain fatty acids including acetic acid and propionic acid while inhibiting methanogenesis the starting leachate solution placed in the polishing tanks  may contain a range of soluble shortchain fatty acids and soluble longchain fatty acids as well as soluble carbohydrates and other soluble carbon sourcesin various embodiments a plurality of polishing tanks may be configured for parallel or series processing of feedstock liquids in some embodiments a single polishing tank may be used in some embodiments some polishing tanks may be controlled so as to produce vfa feedstock liquid mixtures with higher concentrations of acetic acid as a percent of total vfas while other polishing tanks may be controlled so as to produce vfa feedstock liquid mixtures with lower concentrations of acetic acid as a percent of total vfas ie feedstock liquid mixtures with higher relative concentrations of propionic acid andor other longerchain vfasthe polishing tanks  may be seeded with acidphase anaerobic digester bacteria a polishing tank  may be configured to control the ph of the anaerobic fermentation to target a specific mix of vfa concentrations for example a pair of dosing pumps one for acid and one for base may be used to selectively add acid or base to the polishing tank in order to maintain the ph of the liquid within a desired range of a target phthe ph set point for the polishing tanks  may be selected to drive fermentation towards shorterchain vfas or to allow longer chain vfas to remain in some embodiments the polishing tank  may use a relatively low ph set point of between about  and  to inhibit vfaproducing bacteria in order to produce a vfa feedstock with a larger proportion of longerchain vfas in sufficient time and at higher ph set points the bacteria in the polishing tanks  will tend to break down substantially all of the acids into acetic acid the bacteria may be encouraged to break down substantially all of the acids into acetic acid at a faster rate by maintaining a higher ph set point of about  to about  therefore progress of fermentation in the polishing tanks  may be monitored and fermentation may be stopped when a desired target mixture of vfa concentrations or ratios is approximately reached in various embodiments fermentation progress may be monitored by monitoring a quantity of carbon or nitrogen in the tank or by evaluating the liquid with a makeup analyzing device such as a spectrophotometer or other composition analysis devicewhen the fermentation in the polishing tanks  is complete eg when the approximate desired vfa feedstock composition is reached the contents of the polishing tanks  may be allowed to settle to save the solids to seed a subsequent batch to be processed in the polishing tanks table  illustrates an example of vfa compositions in weight percent of total vfas of a leachate liquid entering a polishing tank and compositions in weight percent of total vfas of a vfa

butyric acid wt  isovaleric acid wt valeric acid wt caproic wt  in one example if the vfa feedstock exiting the polishing tank with a composition as shown in table  is directed to a phaprocessing tank  with or without passing through an equalization tank  as described below a pha resin with phbphv ratio of approximately  phb phv may be produced if a resin of higher phbphv ratio is desired the material exiting the polishing tank may be supplemented with either concentrated acetic acid or material from a polishing tank that had been allowed to further break down ie having a higher relative concentration of acetic acid similarly if a resin of lower phbphv ratio is desired the material exiting the polishing tank  may be supplemented with either concentrated propionic acid or material from a polishing tank in which the longer chain acids had not been allowed to break down thereby leaving a higher relative concentration of fatty acids with chains longer than acetic acid eg acids with  carbons or morefrom the polishing tanks  the vfa feedstock liquids  may be pumped into one of a plurality of equalization tanks   where nutrients such as vfa addition nitrogen ammonia phosphorus phosphate and ph may be adjusted to meet a desired vfa feedstock composition specific weight ratios of carbon to nitrogen cn may be targeted in each equalization tanka first equalization tank referred to herein as “eqsbr”  may be configured to prepare a vfa feedstock  for one or more sequencing batch reactors sbrs  configured to produce a bacteria culture liquid  rich in phaproducing bacteria from the prepared vfa feedstock  a second of the equalization tanks referred to herein as “eqpha”  may be configured to prepare the vfa feedstock  for the pha production tanks  which may be configured to perform a bioplastic production process the eqsbr tanks  may have a first target cn weight ratio of about  to about  and the eqpha tank  may have a second different target cn weight ratio of about  to about the sequencing batch reactor tanks  may be configured to grow and condition a mixed consortia of nongeneticallymodified wildtype bacteria using environmental conditioning the environmental conditioning may involve aerobic and anaerobic periods air may be sparged into an sbr tank  during aerobic periods and the sbr tank  may be sealed off from air being sparged into the tank during anaerobic periods eg by operation of a valve or pumpa feastfamine process may also be employed in the sbr tanks  the feastfamine process may comprise periodically feeding and starving bacteria so as to trigger the bacteria to produce pha as an energy storage molecule the sbr tank  may be cycled between feast and famine based on a predetermined cycle time andor based on a measured variable such as ph for example a feast cycle during which nutrients may be continuously or periodically delivered to the solution andor a famine cycle during which no nutrients may be added may proceed for a cycle time of about  hours about  hours about  hours about  hours about  hours about  hours etcduring each feast cycle or each famine cycle ph of the solution in the sbr tank  may be monitored and maintained eg by delivering a quantity of an acid or a base with a dosing pump within a suitable range of a ph set point suitable ph set points may be between about  and about  and may include set points of about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  about  or about the sbr tanks  may also run a maintained baseline feeding strategy where a low level of feed may be added eg through use of a dosing pump from a feedstock reservoir in response to a measured concentration of a critical nutrient when the measured nutrient concentration falls below a threshold level a small quantity of the nutrient may be added so as to maintain the nutrient concentration within a desired band surrounding a setpoint for example the nutrient concentration may be maintained within     or more above andor below a setpoint example set points for the target nutrient concentration may be  ppm  ppm  ppm  ppm  ppm nitrogen in the form of ammonia may also be added reactively ie in order to maintain the nitrogen concentration within a desired range of a set point during the feast periodsthe sbr tank  may be configured to decant a portion of the working volume of the sbr tank  at the end of the famine period for example the decanted portion that becomes the bacteria culture liquid  may be about  to about  or more of the volume of the sbr tank  the decanted bacteria culture liquid  may then be pumped to a pha production tank  the sbr tank  may then be fed again from a new batch of material  from the eqsbr tank a bioplastic production process may then be performed in the pha production tank  the pha production tank  may receive bacteria along with the decanted bacteria culture liquid  from the sbr tank  and may also receive feedstock  from the eqpha tank  in one example embodiment the pha production tank  may run for approximately  hours a first portion of this time may be focused on growing as many pharich cells as possible during this growth phase the tank may be aerated the ph may be maintained and the nitrogen levels may be maintained via ammonia additionthe growth phase in the bioplastic production process may end when the nitrogen has been completely consumed by the bacteria but vfas may remain in solution air flow into the pha production tank  may be cut off at the same time the nitrogen is eliminated thereby causing a trigger for pha accumulation in the bacteria the bacteria may rapidly produce pha and consume the remaining vfas in solution the entire contents of the pha production tank  may then be pumped to separation and extraction equipment for example separation equipment may include a centrifuge or other separation device where the pharich cells may be separated from the remaining liquid and capturedonce the pharich cells are separated from the liquid the remaining liquid may be reused as dilution water in an earlier stage of the process once separated from the liquid the pharich cells may be dried eg by heating thus killing them and stabilizing the pha the dried pha cells may be transported to a processing facility where they can undergo varying levels of extraction and purification processes tailored to different endusesfig

separationsome organic acids which may be vfas may be produced during the anaerobic biological breakdown of carbonaceous organic waste in the vfa production process  described as part of the present disclosure other acids solids gases or other liquids may also be produced in the vfa production process  andor other portions of the process  and may be produced as output materials  at any portion of the process for example and not by way of limitation gaseous methane may be produced during the vfa production process  and removed from the process  after the vfa production process  as an output material  further organic acids may be solubilized in water and distilled or otherwise separated from water during separation process  in some cases both water and concentrated acids may be output materials because vfas range drastically in molecular size and weight from  carbon to  carbon molecules different filters   andor  or others may be employed in the process  for membrane filtration of intermediary products of the process  by properly selecting the filters   and  the vfas may be separated by sizein some cases a specific component of a liquid may be isolated by the use of two or more filters for example a single vfa to be isolated referred to herein as a “target vfa” may be isolated from a bulk flowing liquid by using a first filter to remove molecules larger than the target vfa allowing an intermediate liquid including the target vfa and molecules smaller than the target vfa to pass through the first filter a second filter may then be used to “trap” the target vfa by allowing molecules smaller than the target vfa to pass through the second filter allowing the target vfa to be withdrawn as the unfiltered fluid exiting the second filter such an isolation process may be performed using any suitable filters as described in various examples hereinsuch isolation of one or more target molecules may be understood with reference to fig  which shows a bulk fluid  flowing in a segment of a fluid conduit  a first or “coarse” filter  a coarse filtrate removal conduit  a second or “fine” filter  and an intermediate filtrate removal conduit  in this example the bulk fluid  may comprise an aqueous mixture of organic compounds including various fatty acids the system of fig  may also include field inducing elements  configured to induce electric andor magnetic fields for various purposes as described below as shown in table  many fatty acid molecules have size dimensions different from one anothertable properties of selected fatty acidsmaxminmolmolmolecularrefrac

in molecule size a filter size may be selected to allow one or more identified molecule types to pass through while preventing one or more other molecule types from passing through the filterin the example of fig  the first filter  may have a maximum pore size that is selected to allow at least a first smaller organic compound and a second larger organic compound to pass through the first filter  any organic or inorganic compounds larger than the first organic compound and the second organic compound will not pass through the first filter  and may be removed from the main flow conduit  via the coarse filtrate removal conduit the second filter  may have a maximum pore size that is large enough to allow the first smaller organic compound to pass through the second filter  but small enough to prevent the second larger compound from passing through the second filter  the first organic compound may then continue to flow through the main conduit  along with any other smaller materials in the fine filtrate  the second organic compound may be removed from the main conduit  via the intermediate filtrate conduit in various embodiments any number of filters and intermediate removal conduits may be used for example third fourth or more filters and filtrate removal conduits may be provided downstream of the second filter  in some embodiments multiple compound isolation configurations such as that shown in fig  may be arranged in a cascade configuration for example the coarse filtrate removed via the coarse filtrate removal conduit  may be directed to a second compound isolation conduit with filters sized to isolate one or more compounds from the coarse filtrate fluidthe materials and properties of the first filter  and the second filter  may be selected based on the properties of the molecules to be separated and the liquids in which they are dissolved or dispersed for example table  below lists various membrane filter types and the smallest particle size that each will prevent from passing through the filter depending on the molecules to be separated andor isolated any of the filter types listed in table  may be usedtable membrane filter particle sizesremoval of particlesfiltration methodgreater thanwet sieve nmparticle filter nmmicrofiltration nmultrafiltration nmnanofiltration nmreverse osmosis nm therefore in some embodiments membrane filtration using one or more of the membrane filters listed in table  or any other membrane filter may be used to separate vfas or other carboxylic acids by size in other embodiments other types of filtration may be used alone or in combination with one or more membrane filters to selectively remove one or more vfas or other organic compounds from a solution or dispersion all such combinations of filtration components are within the scope of the present disclosure for example and not by way of limitation magnetic electromagnetic andor electrical filtration may be used to filter desired vfas from intermediate products within the process in some embodiments shortchain fatty acids  to  carbons may be separated from aqueous acid phase anaerobic digestion effluent shortchain fatty acids may include formic acid c acetic acid c propionic acid c butyric acid c isobutyric acid c valeric acid c isovaleric acid cas an example and not by way of limitation the present disclosure allows for the separation of mediumchain fatty acids eg an acid with  to  carbon atoms from an aqueous acid phase anaerobic digestion effluent such mediumchain fatty acids may include but are not limited to caprionichexanoic acid  carbon atoms enanthic acid  carbon atoms caprylicoctanoic acid  carbon atoms pelargonic acid  carbon atoms capric acid  carbon atoms and undecylic acid  carbon atoms other organic acids may also be separated from an aqueous acid phase anaerobic digestion effluentthe addition of inorganic acids or bases to change the ph of the aqueous solution may also cause a specific organic acid to form more or less salt which allows for that specific organic acid to be more easily separated from the other organic acids for example and not by way of limitation calcium magnesium or other materials may be added to the solution to form salts which may create larger molecules with a different polar axis these larger molecules can be filtered from the solution and processed separately without disrupting the process  flowby selecting an appropriate pore size for a filter   andor  an individual fatty acid may be separated from all of the other fatty acids in solution for example and not by way of limitation one organic acid may be separated from all other shortchain and mediumchain fatty acids and any other components in solution by having a first membrane filter of appropriate pore size which allows the desired acid to pass through the membrane with the aqueous filtrate a second filter membrane with a different pore size may then be placed downstream in the process  that does not allow the desired acid to pass through the second filter would then retain the desired acid in the retentate while the solution passing through the second membrane the filtrate would still contain the other organic acids examples of acids that may be retained andor concentrated in this way may include acetic acid lactic acid propionic acid isobutyric acid butyric acid isovaleric acid valeric acid etcdynamic filtrationin some embodiments filtration of some organic molecules including vfas may depend on the orientation of the molecules as they approach and pass through a filter specific vfas and other polar organic molecules may have consistently specific ranges of length to width ratios in addition to having consistently specific ranges of absolute size therefore by orienting polar organic molecules along a particular axis prior to directing the molecules through a filter specific molecules may be allowed to pass through or prevented from passing through filter pores of a known size for example as illustrated in table  below some organic compounds have substantially different minimum and maximum dimensionstable minimum and maximum dimensions of example compoundsmax molecularmin molecularrejectorganic aciddiameter nmdiameter nmfilteracetic acidropropionic acidrobutyric acidrovaleric acidrohexanoic acidroheptanoic acidnanooctanoic acidnanolactic acidro in some embodiments polar molecules may be placed in a desired orientation by the presence of a magnetic andor electric field for example polar molecules with positive and negative poles may generally be oriented so as to align with an electric andor magnetic field based on the principles of electromagnetic attraction if such alignment is performed prior to or while directing the fluid to a filter the polar molecules may fit through a smaller nominal pore size in a membrane filter in one orientation even if they might not fit through the filter in another orientationfor example a filter may be selected to have pore sizes in between the minimum diameter and the maximum diameter for a particular molecule or compound if the particular polar molecule is oriented such that its smallest dimension is parallel to the pores of the filter then the molecule may pass through the filter whereas the same molecule may be prevented from passing through the filter when the molecule is oriented with its largest dimension parallel to the filter poresin some embodiments a magnetic field may be oriented such that one or more polar molecules are aligned to be strained from a liquid flow by orienting the molecules such that the molecules larger dimension does not fit through the filter pores and thus does not pass through the membrane filter eg filters     andor depending on various characteristics of a polar organic molecule such as physical size polar charges molecular weight etc some polar organic molecules may be oriented with a weaker electric or magnetic field as compared to other polar organic molecules therefore in some embodiments specific polar organic molecules may be targeted for alignment by varying the strength of an electric or magnetic field applied to the fluid conduit adjacent to one or more filtersby controlling the orientation and strength of an electric or magnetic field various vfas may be removed from anywhere in the process  and may be specifically removed via filtration portions of the process  at filters     andor electric or magnetic fields configured for affecting the orientation of organic compounds in a fluid flowing within a conduit may be created or controlled by a variety of field inducing devices  which may include permanent magnets electromagnets various wire configurations or other devices for example permanent magnets useful as field inducing devices may include any magnet that may retain desired magnetic properties in the absence of an inducing field or current permanent magnets may be made of any suitable material and in any shape desirable for use as a field inducing device  for example permanent magnets may be barshaped ringshaped plateshaped discshaped arcshaped crescentshaped cylindrical segmented or otherwise shaped or configuredwhen used as field inducing devices  electromagnets may include structures comprising one or more coils of electrically conductive wire surrounding a magnetizable core in some cases a magnetizable core may be omitted and a configuration of electrically conductive wires may be configured to directly interact with fluids in a conduitfig  fig  and fig  schematically illustrate examples of magnetic andor electric fields shown by field lines  that may be produced by one or more field inducing devices  in various orientations relative to the conduit  through which a fluid may flow any of the field orientations of fig  fig  or fig  or other field orientations may be desirable either to cause the oriented molecules to be prevented from passing through a filter or allowed to pass through a filter depending on relative sizes of the molecules and the filter pores as well as whether the polar axis is aligned with a larger dimension or a smaller dimension of a targeted organic compoundin general a positive pole or positive poles of a polar molecule will tend to be attracted by the negative poles of an induced field and repelled by the positive pole of the induced field similarly the negative pole or negative poles of a polar molecule will tend to be repelled by the negative poles of an induced field and attracted by the positive pole of the induced field therefore polar molecules within a conduit may be oriented by orienting positive and negative poles of one or more induced fields in a desired region of a conduitfig  illustrates the interaction of two fields  oriented with opposite poles of first and second field inducing devices  on opposite sides of a conduit  the field within the conduit  resulting from field inducing devices oriented as shown in fig  has a predominant polar axis that is perpendicular or “normal” or “transverse” to the longitudinal axis of the conduit  such an arrangement of induced fields may be desirable in order to orient polar axes of polar organic molecules in the transverse orientationfig  illustrates the interaction of two fields  oriented with same poles of first and second field inducing devices  on opposite sides of a conduit  the field within the conduit  resulting from field inducing devices oriented as shown in fig  has a predominant polar axis that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the conduit  such an arrangement of induced fields may be desirable in order to orient polar axes of polar organic molecules in the longitudinal orientationfig  illustrates a field  induced in a section of a conduit  by a coil of electrically conductive wire  surrounding the section of the conduit  the field  within the conduit  resulting from field inducing devices oriented as shown in fig  has a predominant polar axis that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the conduit  such an arrangement of induced fields may be desirable in order to orient polar axes of polar organic molecules in the longitudinal orientationin various embodiments any two or more field inducing mechanisms or orientations of field inducing devices may be employed in concert to achieve one or more desired orientations of one or more polar organic compounds in a fluid flowing within a conduit field inducing devices  may be oriented in any desired positions relative to one another and to the conduit  depending on the desired effect for example two three or more field inducing devices  may be positioned adjacent to a section of conduit  to produce a desired field interaction patternfor example the field orientations of either fig  or fig  may be produced with a single pair of electromagnets as field inducing devices positioned on opposite sides of a conduit  the system may be switched between the field orientations of fig  and fig  by reversing the direction of electric current in one of the field inducing electromagnets the strength of one or more fields induced by an electromagnet may be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing electric current or voltage delivered to a field inducing device such a system may be combined with a field inducing device such as that illustrated in fig  to allow further variations in induced field orientation and strengthin some embodiments various fields may be induced so as to selectively orient polar molecules in a transverse plane in the conduit or in any other plane intersecting the conduit for example a first pair of field inducing devices may be used to orient polar molecules in a northsouth orientation within a transverse plane the first pair of field inducing devices may be switched off eg by removing power to electromagnets or by physically removing permanent magnets and a second pair of field inducing devices may be activated to induce one or more fields orienting polar molecules in an eastwest orientation within the transverse plane such an arrangement may be desired in order to orient polar molecules relative to shaped pores in a filter so as to selectively allow or prevent passage of an oriented organic compound through the filterin some embodiments a process for selecting a targeted compound may include establishing a first electric andor magnetic field within a first section of conduit and directing a fluid containing the targeted compound through the first section conduit to a first filter in some cases the process may also include directing the fluid through a second section of conduit toward a second filter establishing a second field in the second section of conduit adjacent to the second filter and removing a portion of the fluid including the targeted compound from an intermediate fluid conduit between the first filter and the second filter in some cases the process may also include changing a strength or an orientation of the first field or the second fieldin some embodiments field inducing devices may include one or more patterns of conductive wires embedded in or adjacent to a filter such as any of filters     andor  for example a filter may comprise a laminated structure with one or more layers of a porous membrane with pores of a desired size and one or more layers containing electrically conductive wires supported adjacent to in contact with or integrally formed with the filter membranefig  and fig  illustrate examples of electrically conductive wire patterns that may be provided in or adjacent to a filter membrane the pattern of fig  includes a single conductive wire  in a spiral configuration  with lead wires  that may be electrically connected to an electronic controller andor a power supply  if the spiral wire  is oriented in a transverse plane in a longitudinal conduit then directing an electric current through the spiral wire  may induce a field with a polar axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the conduit changing the direction of the applied current may change the direction of the induced field in some embodiments multiple layers of spiral wires may be combined to further alter the shape andor strength of an induced fielda power supply eg  in fig  configured for delivering electric current to a pattern of wires may comprise any suitable power supply such as a direct current power supply with constant current variable current constant voltage or variable voltage capabilities alternatively the power supply may be an alternating current power supply configured to deliver a constant ac signal a variable signal or a variety of ac signalsfig  illustrates a plurality of wires  oriented in a grid pattern  when a pair of wires such as wires   is connected to a power supply and an electric current is directed through the wires the current will follow a partial loop in the plane of the wires thereby inducing a magnetic field with a polar axis perpendicular to the plane of the wires in various embodiments various pairs of wires may be simultaneously or sequentially connected to a power supply in order to direct electric current through a variety of loops in the plane of the wires for example the power supply may be switchably joined to each of the individual wires and a controller may be configured to switch the power supply to deliver current to selected pairs of wires at different times or simultaneouslyin some embodiments two or more parallel layers of wires may be provided to further configure the induced field as desired in some embodiments the grid of wires of a second layer may be rotated about the longitudinal conduit axis relative to a first layer such as by ° ° or by any other angle in some cases the grid of wires may include curved segments rather than straight segments as illustrated in fig in some embodiments the wires shown in fig  or fig  may comprise small coils of wires eg similar in shape to coiled piano wires with longitudinal axes oriented in the illustrated patterns small coiled wires or straight wires may also be arranged in any other pattern for use as described hereinin various embodiments filters with layers of patterned wires may be used for other purposes in addition to or instead of inducing fields within the conduit for example applying an electric current to the wires and reversing polarity of the applied electric current multiple times per second eg at  hz  hz or any other suitable frequency may cause polar molecules within the fluid to rapidly change orientation thereby causing heating due to friction between adjacent molecules such localized heating of the fluid andor the filter membrane may be useful for causing temperaturelinked changes to properties of the liquid for example density and viscosity tend to be temperaturedependent so localized heating may be used to a decrease viscosity of a fluid passing through a filter any of the filters used in the various systems and methods herein eg any of filters     andor  may be configured to heat a fluid a filter membrane or other objects by induction in some embodiments the wires may be made of an electrically conductive material with a sufficiently high electrical resistance that the wires may be used to heat the filter membrane andor the fluid by resistive heating when a sufficient electric current is passed through the wiresin some embodiments filters with layers of patterned wires may be used for performing flow measurements of fluid flow rate andor chemical composition of the fluids passing through the filter which may include any of filters     andor  for example a fluid containing a quantity of polar molecules flowing through a plane of wires whether adjacent to a filter or not may induce one or more electric currents in the wires depending on the pattern of wires as described above a particular wire configuration may be calibrated with fluids of known compositions in order to obtain induced electric current signals corresponding to the particular compositions using such calibration values induced currents may be evaluated to estimate the composition of fluids flowing past the wires in some embodiments flow rates may be similarly detected based on calibration values obtained by flowing fluids at known flow rates and detecting induced electric currentsin some embodiments by measuring the flow through one or more of the filters   andor  the wires may be controlled to increase the flow decrease the flow or open close or otherwise modify the flow through filters   andor  such that desired particulates acids or other portions of the flow may be removed or passed through the filters   andor  for example orienting molecules so as to prevent them from passing through a filter may cause some pores to be blocked to the passage of smaller molecules once enough pores become blocked the bulk flow rate of both solutes and solvent eg water through the filter may decrease or stopin some embodiments wires in or adjacent to a filter eg filters     andor  may also assist in assessing membrane viability rupture or clogging of the filters   andor  and may also be used to remedy clogging of the membrane for example membrane viability rupture or clogging may be deduced based on measured flow rates as described above in some embodiments clogging may be remedied by differently orienting polar compounds so that all compounds may pass through a filter in other cases if a filter has become blocked due to an accumulation of trapped molecules changing an induced field so as to cause molecules to rotate to different positions may allow for some of the trapped molecules to pass through the filter thereby clearing or reducing the blockageby enabling a variable electromagnetic field in the filters   andor  the present disclosure also allows for alteration of the flow through the filters   andor  for example a strong enough electromagnetic field may close the pores of the filters   andor  altogether or create a variable pore size for one or more of the filters   andor fig  illustrates a process flow diagram illustrating a method  for electromagnetic separation in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure in  a membrane filter is exposed to an electromagnetic field in  the aqueous carboxylic acid is dissolved with a solvent in the solution the solution comprises a plurality of aqueous carboxylic acids and is passed through the membrane filter a strength and an orientation of the electromagnetic field are selected to affect at least one of the plurality of aqueous carboxylic acids in the solutionin some embodiments the systems and methods described with reference to fig fig  may be used to isolate or remove one or more inorganic polar compounds from a liquid by selectively orienting the one or more inorganic polar compound in a desired orientation relative to a filterplug flow digesterfig a and fig b illustrate digesters  and  with advantageous features and configurations the digesters  and  which may be used alone or in combination with other digesters as described with respect to fig  may be configured to allow for “plug flow” processing of the material  the digesters  and  may be used as any of the digesters eg process chambers   in the systems and processes described hereinthe digesters  and  may also allow for separation of different acids and other liquids from the digestion process at different times and points during digestion removing liquids from different stages of digestion may advantageously allow for liquids with different concentrations of digestion products to be separately obtained evaluated and used in various parts of the overall process as shown in fig a the digester  may generally include a bulk material chamber  through which bulk material  flows horizontally from an input end  to an output end  the chamber  may be separated from a plurality of catch bins ae by a plurality of filter screens  each catch bin  may be fluidically coupled to a makeup analysis module  which may evaluate the makeup of liquids in the corresponding catch bin  depending on the detected makeup of the liquids the liquids may be directed for use by a downstream process  or may be adjusted  eg by separation additives etc before being directed to a downstream process for use in some embodiments a downstream process for using materials from the catch bins  may include a polymerization process or other bioplastic production process eg  in fig in some embodiments the material  may be moved through the chamber  in a plug flow with minimal mixing some mechanisms for advancing flow through the chamber  are described below moving material  through the chamber  with minimal mixing may be advantageous due to the timedependent nature of anaerobic digestion however in other embodiments a greater degree of material mixing may be acceptableas material  moves through the chamber  organic materials may be digested by bacteria present in material mixture liquids produced by the digestion as well as any liquids already present in the material may be drawn by gravity until they pass through the filter screens and into the catch bins  although fig a illustrates only five catch bins  the digester  may include as many or as few catch bins as desiredthe digester  allows for the capture of liquids at different stages of the anaerobic bacterial digestion process in some embodiments the rate of material flow through the chamber  may be configured such that hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis occur within the chamber but before the digestion process proceeds to methanogenesis in other embodiments methanogenesis may be allowed to occur within the chamber in some embodiments material  may be continuously moved through the chamber  in a plugflow or mixing fashion in other embodiments the material  may be occasionally moved through the chamber such as by advancing material  by a distance and then stopping the movement for a period of time before again advancing the material  towards the output end for the purposes of description the digestion process using the digester  will now be described with reference to a single “plug” of material moving from the input end  of the chamber to the output end  in general if the material  introduced at the input end  of the chamber  contains substantially undigested biomass the bacteria in the digester  will begin to break down the material  in the plug through hydrolysis liquids produced by hydrolysis may drip into the first catch bin a andor the second catch bin bas the plug material moves through the chamber  the material may be further broken down by acidogenic processes acids produced by acidogenic bacteria may drip into the second catch bin b the third catch bin c andor the fourth catch bin d as the plug material continues to move through the chamber  the material may be further broken down by acetogenic processes liquids containing acetate including acetic acid produced by acetogenic bacteria such as clostridium aceticum in one embodiment may drip into the fourth catch bin d andor the fifth catch bin ein some embodiments one or more catch bins  may be closed so as to prevent liquids or materials from falling into the bin closing one or more bins may allow digestion to proceed for a longer time and therefore a longer distance through the chamber assuming continuous movement before removing liquids from the chamber fig b illustrates a digester  in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure and may include any of the features and advantages described with respect to fig a the digester  may include a cylindrical chamber  a shaft  and an auger  a helical drive ribbon  may be attached to the auger  so as to be rotatable by the shaft about the axis of the shaft the shaft  auger  and ribbon  may rotate either through motorized rotation or other mechanicalelectrical forces to move material through the digester the material may be fed into the digester  through the front  or may be fed through another opening in the outer wall of the cylinder  the digester  although shown as substantially level may also be tilted to provide gravitational assistance to the material as the material passes through the digester  further the digester may be made in various sizes eg ten feet long with a two foot diameter twenty feet long with a four foot diameter twenty feet long with a three foot diameter etc without departing from the scope of the present disclosure in some embodiments much larger sized digesters may also be used such as  feet long with a  foot diameter or morethe rotational speed of the shaft  and the number of turns in the auger  and ribbon  may dictate how fast the material will be pushed through the digester  because digester  may be an acid phase digester there may be a certain minimum or maximum amount of time that material should be housed in the digester  for example if material is left too long in the digester  eg longer than fifteen days the material may begin to produce substantial quantities of methane gas inside of the digester  which may damage the digester  or prevent further generation of acids from that batch of materialin another aspect of the present disclosure the shaft  and the ribbon  may be optional parts of the digester  in such embodiments the digester may be referred to as a “batch” digester in which the material in the digester  rather than being moved along the axis of the digester  is digested as a single batch of material the batch of material may be placed into the digester  through an opening in any portion of the cylinder  or other part of the digester  further there may be other types of digesters such as a continuous flow digester sequenced batch digesters fed batch digesters or others that are considered within the scope of the present disclosure in other embodiments the ribbon  and shaft  may be replaced by other mechanical elements configured to move the bulk material through the digester chamber  for example such elements may use peristaltic flow gravity centrifugal forces pistons air pressure inflatable flexible bladders or other forces or elements configured to move bulk material through the digester chamber regardless of whether the digester  is a batch continuous plugflow or other type of digester the digester  may also include one or more screens  along the bottom of the cylinder  the cylinder  of the digester  may be rotated such that the screen  is rotated to a position where the screen  may be “opened” such that material may be placed into the cylinder  through the opening in the screen  the screen  may then be closed and the cylinder  rotated such that the screen  is rotated to be proximate to the bins anin various embodiments any suitable mechanism may be used to prevent liquid or other material from flowing into one or more of the bins such mechanisms may include valves sliding doors one or more iris mechanisms etc in some embodiments each bin may have an individually operably closing mechanism which may be operated to selectively close one or more bins to prevent fluids or other materials from flowing into the selected binin some embodiments bin closure mechanisms may be omitted entirely in such embodiments if liquid collected in one or more bins is determined based on analysis by a makeup module or other analyzer to require further processing the liquid in that bin may be directed back into the digester or to another digester or processing systemregardless of whether the digester  is a batch continuous plugflow or other type of digester the screen  may be of different sizes along the length of the chamber  to allow for different sized particles andor liquids or liquids only to be drained from the cylinder  into the various catch bins the liquids or other materials drained from the cylinder  may be captured in bins an attached along a length of the cylinder  each bin an may capture the drained materials at different points along the length of the cylinder  and thus each of the bins an may catch liquid at different locations in the digestion processalthough shown in cylindrical form the digester  may be of other shapes or crosssections without departing from the scope of the present disclosure for example and not by way of limitation the digester  may be rectangular in shape and square or rectangular in crosssection the digester  may also have the screens  at different locations such as in a corner or offcentered in any digester  configuration or shapean example of a digester having a different shape may be a cargocontainer where the screen  is placed in a wall a floor or a ceiling or offcentered in the cargo container the cargo container may then be employed as a batchprocessing digester  the digester  may also have different crosssections along the length of the digester for example and not by way of limitation one portion of the digester  may be a plugflow digester having a cylindrical crosssection as shown in fig a another portion having a rectangular crosssection may be coupled to the cylindrical portion of the digester the material flowing through the digester may be processed with a plug flow process in the cylindrical portion and with a batch process in the rectangular portion various crosssections shapes and sizes are envisioned within the scope of the present disclosurethe digesters  and  may also include any number of pumps valves or other flow control elements configured to recirculate liquids from one or more bins an or an and return the liquid into the cylinder  or  or to direct liquids to other processing equipment the recirculation may occur directly above the bin or directly above one or more downstream bins to move the liquid along with the solids that are being pushed through each of the bins an or an may be sampled or analyzed to determine the physical and chemical makeup of the liquids at various points in the digestion processin some embodiments the digesters  and  may be operated in a nonsterile environment the material fed into the digesters  and  may be sterile or nonsterile eg the material may be organic waste products such as fruit culls agricultural waste industrial waste restaurant waste etc and as such the digester may accept nonsterile materials and process these materials in less than sterile environmentsthe digesters  and  in another aspect may also allow for the use of different bacterial digestion agents along the length of the digester  or  as such each of the bins an or an may collect liquid that contains different types of acids or different concentrations of acids along the length of the digester  or  each of the collections in the bins an or an may also be directed to different processing steps within process  depending on the acids present the concentrations and other factorsby monitoring the collected liquids in the bins an or an as well as monitoring the samplers     or other samplers within the process  concentration ratios of different vfas lactic acid and other acids and compositions may be achieved by having different concentration ratios different output materials  having different material qualities and characteristics may be produced for example the polyhydroxybutyrate phb to polyhydroxyvalerate phv ratio of the output material changes the material properties by changing the feedstock characteristics through different concentration ratios of different acids the phbphv ratio can be controlled in the process  further by separating or not separating some of the acids such as lactic acid from the digester  or  the production of polylactic acid pla can be inhibited or enhanced in the output material the process  at least through the samplers    and  may have automated via the processor  or manual monitoring and adjustment of the process materials to ensure the consistent production of the output material  having the desired material properties the process  samples materials throughout to measure concentrations of nutrients and then calculates the supplemental material to add to or dilute the process material in order to achieve a desired recipe for consistent material properties in the output material some materials that are created or are byproducts of the process  may be inhibitory to the anaerobic digestion process of the process chambers  andor  for example and not by way of limitation citrus culls and rots may represent a good feedstock for the production of pha resins but limonene and other essential oils present in a citrus cull feedstock may inhibit the anaerobic digestion process the process  may recapture these essential oils as a byproduct of the process  which also aids in the efficiency of the process  overallslurry analyzerfig  illustrates a slurry makeup module  in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure slurry makeup module  accepts output  from the digester  and separates the incoming material in separator  separator  may for example separate limonene from the acids and send the limonene as a byproducts via  other separations may be done by separator  to separate individual acids from the output to separate each acid or one output of the slurry makeup module  from another a sampler  samples the output stream  this may be analyzed electronically through the processor  or manually as desired the processor  may send signals  andor  to control the nutrient additive bank  or the control additives  to control other parts of the process  these signals may be administered manually by an operator if desiredreferring again to fig  the separation process  may also be analyzed either electronically or manually to determine the concentration of acids in the separated product  the liquid makeup analysis module  may be similar to the makeup module  and corresponding processes described with respect to eg fig  the liquid makeup analysis  may also provide inputs to the control additives

transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength and generally involves directing light of one or more specified wavelengths through a sample receiving transmitted light at an opposite side of the sample and evaluating the received light the amount of light of specified wavelengths that is absorbed by the sample may be measured based on the difference between the known transmitted light and the light received by the detector the amount of light of specific wavelengths absorbed by the sample may be correlated with the concentration of various chemical andor biological constituents of the sample in other words the amount of light that passes through the sample may be indicative of the concentration of certain compounds that do not allow light to pass throughas discussed herein some vfas and other polar organic compounds may have different minimum and maximum sizes which may be aligned with a polar axis as a result such polar organic molecules may be placed in a desired orientation by an electric andor magnetic field if a polar organic molecule with an elongated dimension is oriented such that the elongated dimension is parallel to a line

be adapted to produce an output material  substantially comprising a solid acetate material that may be useful as a road salt or aggregate material a specific example of an output material  in an aspect of the present disclosure may be calcium magnesium acetate cmacma is a potential replacement material for sodium chloride in certain applications sodium chloride also known as table salt is used to reduce the freezing temperature of water on roadways to allow for safer driving conditions sand may also be used along with the sodium chloride to provide better traction in winter driving conditions although salt and sand mixtures are inexpensive to apply these applications are harmful to the environment and they damage and corrode the vehicles that use these roadways for example the water runoff from salted roads adds both sodium and chlorine to local watersheds and water supplies which must be removed during water treatment sodium and chlorine are both contaminants to local watersheds and deter flora and fauna from growing andor reproduction when present in higher concentrationsa potential replacement for the saltsand mixture is a different salt mixture containing a combination of calcium acetate and magnesium acetate a possible mixture of calcium acetate and magnesium acetate is an approximate  mixture but other percentages may be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure both calcium acetate and magnesium acetate are environmentally friendly biodegradable salts cma is currently used in areas having watersheds sensitive to high sodium and chlorine concentrations unlike sodium chloride that degrades into sodium and chlorine cma does not add any sodium or chlorine to these watersheds cma degrades into calcium and magnesium components which act as micronutrients for plants and aquatic biology the acetate may be naturally biologically consumed and converted to carbon dioxide and methane which reduces ecological and watershed damage when compared to the effects of sodium and chlorinein an aspect of the present disclosure cma may be produced using the process  described herein for example vfa production process  of the process  using anaerobic degradation of organic wastes may be used to convert organic waste materials into substantial quantities of acetic acid if allowed to proceed too far the vfa production process  may result in the production of methane gas production of methane gas may be avoided or limited by performing anaerobic acid phase digestion of organic waste input materials until high concentrations of soluble acetic acid are produced in an aqueous effluentin some embodiments of a cma production process an anaerobic digester  andor  may be used to produce a vfa rich stream which may contain acetic acid other vfas and other carboxylic acids the liquids produced by the digester may be filtered by one or more filters  andor  or otherwise separated as described herein in order to obtain a concentrated acetic acid solution containing few if any other vfas for example in some embodiments the concentrated acetic acid solution may be an aqueous solution containing a mass percent acetic acid concentration of about  to about  about  to about  about  to about  or about  to about the concentrated aqueous acetic acid stream  may then be placed into an extraction column with a solvent which is immiscible or at least partially immiscible in water in one embodiment the added solvent is trioctyl phosphoric oxide topo in kerosene the solubility of the carboxylic acid in the solvent exceeds the solubility of the carboxylic acid in the aqueous mixture such that a majority of the carboxylic acid is partitioned into the solventthe added solvent may be separated from the aqueous stream and may be transferred to a second extractor and combined with alkali eg potassium or alkaline earth eg calcium andor magnesium source materials that may be dissolved in a solvent in one example calcium and magnesium source materials include dolomitic lime which may contain equal parts calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate and may be dissolved in a second solvent which may include water or any other solvent suitable for dissolving calcium andor magnesium source materials other calcium andor magnesium source materials may include oyster shells egg shells or other suitable shellsa mixture of calcium and magnesium source materials dissolved in the second solvent may be combined with the acetic acid solution dissolved in the added solvent in a second extractor the mixture in the second extractor may form calcium acetate and magnesium acetate along with carbonate byproducts dissolved andor suspended in a solvent mixture the carbonate byproducts may be removed from the cmacontaining solvent mixture in a separation process eg any of the separation processes described above such as process  in some embodiments the carbonates may be removed from the cmacontaining solvent mixture using a belt filterthe cma may be separated from the solvent containing the cma using a spray dryer which may produce a powdered cma salt as a final product the solvents may then be recovered from the spray dryer as well as any unreacted calcium andor magnesium source materials eg dolomitic limeif the output material  desired is potassium acetate a similar process as described for cma may be used in such cases a potassium source material such as potassium ash may be used in place of the calcium andor magnesium source materials the process may otherwise proceed substantially the same as described abovein some embodiments a calciummagnesium salt or a potassium salt may be produced using other vfas vfas in place of or in addition to acetic acid such additional vfas may include propionic acid butyric acid and valeric acid which may be used to produce various combinations of acetic acid salts propionic acid salts butyric acid salts and valeric acid salts these salts can be formed using calcium magnesium or potassiumsuch salt mixtures may be less expensive to produce and these salts are also all biodegradable further since these salts also lower the freezing temperature of water they would serve a similar purpose to cma andor sodium chloride and still provide environmental benefits these additional salts may be obtained by using use less filtration of the products of acid phase anaerobic digestion within the process  described herein further manufacturing of such a salt mixture may allow for omission or modification of some of the steps of process  as described herein and still be within the scope of the present disclosurefig  illustrates a process flow diagram illustrating a method  for producing alkali andor alkaline earth metal carboxylates in
