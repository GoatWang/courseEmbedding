and we do not assume any obligation to update the forwardlooking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after today please keep this in mind when listening to a replay of this call ill now turn the call over to kevin for his opening remarks kevin denuccio thanks cory and good afternoon everyone revenues for the quarter were  million versus  million in prior quarter and  million a year ago this quarters performance is obviously frustrating and disappointing as we strongly believe it could be the quarter that returns revenue upward after a downward trend for more than a year both of our international theaters in the emea and apac had extremely difficult product sales in the quarter the international markets alone could account for a short fall from expectations for north america we did see several customers expand their initial deployment of the fsp platform however the overall performance in the us and for the company overall was primarily caused by our inability to close significant orders in time from our key fortune  customers two of our top five customers have been testing or evaluating our new family of products which were not available for revenue last quarter we are on those products in a minute but this was a contributing factor in us not being able to generate product revenue with two of our top customers our target market of large fortune  and global  companies makes orders naturally large and lumpy and challenging in terms of long sales cycles and its been a large part of our inability to consistently execute or return to growth bottom line is that it was a very tough quarter for us so let me turn the conversation to what it means for the company going forward we still believe violin is on verge of reversing our revenue trend and heading upward with this in mind we also believe several changes are necessary to accelerate the companys return to growth and enable longterm success most importantly violin must retain our customer confidence in both our longterm plans and viability as a strategic technology provider id like to lay out the important pillars for our success going forward first is about violins technology leadership disruptive innovation and software maturity which we believe can be the most important factors to renew revenue growth we are on the verge of announcing a next generation family of flash storage platform comprised of industry leading all flash arrays the announcement is scheduled for next week on september   we believe these new products will once again establish violin as the leader in the combination of every category measured in afas latency affordability density scalability and performance as it relates to eyeoffs violin is doubling the performance of its current arrays while driving a fivefold improvement and consistent low latency while offering significant density and the lowest cost currently available well also announce the general availability of encryption software related to security that will make the violin arrays the most secure storage arrays in the industry irrespective of whether data is in flight or at rest this capability will be available on our legacy systems as well as our new line of arrays we will also roll out of our vision and initial products around cloud storage which will position the violins flash storage platform as the best product line for building private hybrid and public clouds by leveraging violins newest market innovation for seamlessly integrating and communicating between these environments the offering of concerto in the cloud will allow customers the ability to use any public cloud as a backup site disaster recovery or failover site or even use the cloud as a second or third tier of lower performance storage all of these capabilities will be usable and accessible without any changes to any other public clouds such as aws azure or google and all managed from violins company management suite that enables a single pane of glass to be used to manage and organize customer data leveraging the concerto operating system weve achieved this by virtualizing concerto allowing it to run seamlessly and virtual machine in the cloud we feel the seamless private public cloud integration is unique and strategic as large enterprises aggressively move to private hybrid and public cloud implementations while enterprises have been migrating data and after the cloud over the last several years the coordination management andor retrieval challenges of data have been very difficult the concerto in the cloud solution will address this customer pinpoint this announcement is a massive delivery of technology leadership and innovation and it demonstrates violins commitment to deliver technology leadership for its customers this technology leadership is one of the key pillars for violins turnaround and a key tenant for the companys longterm successes as i just mentioned every two of our fortune  customer order delays from last quarter were related to waiting for delivery of the new flash storage platforms features and functionality at the launch we will also discuss the companys vision for next generation technology such as nvme over fabrics i encourage you to go to our website to register to attend the september  product launch and vision webcast the second pillar of a long term viability and success as do with continuing to improve violins operational efficiencies overall cost structure and time to breakeven point with our return to revenue growth taking much longer than we anticipated we are attempting to build the most efficient organization possible to create longevity in our time to complete our turnaround today we are announcing that we are broadening the responsibilities of ebrahim abbasi our chief operating officer ebrahim will assume sales and marketing responsibilities for the business in addition to his current responsibilities in rd customer support and manufacturing operations said ouissal will be focused on transitioning sales and field operations responsibilities to ebrahim and will assume his strategy position reporting directly to me this is also part of reducing and taking a layer of management out of our senior ranks more appropriate to the size of the business ebrahim has been key and leading the maturing and stabilizing actions of violin’s product development particularly to concerto operating system over the last year and he’s credited with leading a successful delivery of the new fsp products to be announced next week while also driving violin’s lower expense structure ebrahim has always spent a lot of time in the field with customers and we believe his aggressive always upbeat positive attitude that is infectious and have an impact we need to reinvigorating sales and customer confidence with the launch of the new products and of course with my background of  years in sales i will be intimately involved due to the critical importance of returning violin to revenue growth in addition to the above actions violin also announced last quarter the opening of our first low cost rd site in kiev ukraine in conjunction with our partner globallogic weve currently ramped to  developers with our intention to ramp to  by year end this is a key element in our strategy to have the lowest cost structure in the industry without sacrificing our ability to keep our pace of innovation and technology leadership violins remote rd site will give the company the ability to scale at a significantly lower cost structure the third pillar to achieve success and viability for our customers and shareholders will be tightly managing both our cash on hand and our ability to continue raising additional funding to address the companys projected losses through the profitability this is where ill be spending most of my immediate time in this regard we finished last quarter with  million in cash after a  million cash burn in q we believe our cost cutting and streamlining strategy will achieve a quarterly expense rate of under  million by q over a  reduction from q last year this should reduce our quarterly burn to approximately  million at the beginning of the year from  million last quarter the impact of this will give us the lowest breakeven point of any of our public peers to between  million and  million in annual revenue we believe that achieving this level of cash burn places us in the best position to obtain the necessary funding to continue to finance the business we are currently talking to both strategic and financial sponsors to address our need to raise capital and the overall financial structure of the company we announced the filing of a shelf registration during last quarter for  of our outstanding shares bruce grant our largest shareholder and newest board member is leading this effort with me bruce continues to show his support and belief in the company he will also continue to have open discussions with our bondholders in order to maximize the success and value creation of the business as we build towards profitability as i talk to customers and investors i explain the difference and arbitrage between wall street evaluations of a company  in the silicon valley evaluation of a company wall street primarily values financial metrics such as revenue growth earnings or pes as well as cash user needs the peer that we are paying the price for being public where silicon valley values technology creation differentiation market opportunity and human talent in this silicon valley regard violin remains an extremely valuable company with many of the best assets in an industry that is an enormous disruption and with incredible opportunity and while it is very painful to navigate the violin turnaround publicly it gives our customers the ultimate transparency far above any private company or startup or a comparison to our few public peers for using enormous burn rates to achieve their growth if it wasnt validated in this belief and what we offer to customers one would have to believe that no startup could ever make it i think one of the things the team and i underestimated with the difficulty and time needed in getting enterprise class maturity reliability and customer confidence in a our comprehensive concerto operating system concerto operating is the broadest set of data services available in the industry in a native afa operating system it is concerto that not only delivers always functionality but allows us to offer the first  architecture in allflash arrays this architecture was formally only available in highend legacy disk product such as emc vmax one other thing we spent  the last year focused is on hardening and maturing concerto to deliver on the flash storage platform  architecture and along with the launch of all the new fsp products we will be delivering the latest release of concerto version  that we have been hardening since last september as you know we are competing in a very different segment of the market in a public peers as we target the largest global  and fortune  enterprises in almost critical application with this first last phase  architecture it’s been challenging for us because this global  business is big lumpy and conservative around critical applications essential for their business however as these mega franchises consisting of fortune  and global  expand their violin roll up to full production we believe they will produce large ongoing revenue stream that can serve as the foundation for the company’s growth and success now i would also like to share some comments on the market and competition as a competition is fierce in  the industry saw flash main streaming across the storage landscape a position violin staked out  months ago when the company first launched the flash storage platform we positioned our product and service capabilities along with our company mindset to enter into this largest segment in market opportunity we’ve seen a much change in competition over the last couple of quarters due to the mainstreaming of the market for flash this is most notable with the biggest competitors in the business now reverting back to legacy architectures dust fully with ssds and away from the acquired allflash array platform we believe this is primarily due to two factors first is the market need to go back to the full suite of features and functionality required in large enterprise primary storage market and applications this need consist of a completely integrated suite of features and reliability profile that is available in the fsp today its important to note that this tightly integrated offering is not available in any other startup or legacy competitor that offers in allflash array the second factor is that raw flash cost curve level is defending fast enough that its becoming possible to meet competitive price point without eduplication technology which has been central for making flash affordable versus disk over the last couple of years we believe this cost reduction will further accelerate flash adoption in environments that are not well suited for eduplication as they can simply migrate traditional second pin launch to flash to accelerate data base and high performance applications this is a segment where violin first made its mark and had early success now with this broader market segment coming of age to flash and with violins continued innovation violin should once again be able to drive market adoption and success by serving the needs of these customers we still have many challenges to return to growth and complete our turnaround and with the pillars i laid out for our success above along with our structural changes we are focused on our execution and the ability to be successful for our customers investors and employees going forward cory will now provide his remarks on our financial results cory sindelar thank you kevin revenue for the first quarter was  million a decrease of  sequentially from revenue of  million for the first quarter and a decrease of  from the year ago period this result was below our guidance of  million to  million for the quarter our total revenue  came from the americas which is up from  last quarter emea was  about the same as last quarter and asia was down to  from  last quarter we had two new customers down from seven in the prior quarter and new customers accounted for approximately  of our total revenue down from nearly  last quarter and transactions direct with end user customers were about  of total revenue as compared with  last quarter our gaap gross margin for the second quarter was  as compared to  in the prior quarter this was due to an inventory writeoff in light of our material reduction in sales  product sales relative to our forecast and the pending new product introduction we estimated that we have more inventory than needed to cover our forecasted sales for the current platform over the next  months based on this analysis we took an accounting charge of  million in the quarter we still have the opportunity to sell these units in time like we have done with our  series products our nongaap gross margin for the second quarter improved to  which compares to  last quarter and was below our guidance of  to  the increase in gross margin versus prior quarter was due to the fact that service margin  our service revenue which is at higher gross margins was a larger percentage of total revenue operating expenses on a gaap basis were  million for the second quarter which is down from  million for the first quarter our nongaap operating expenses for the second quarter were lower by  million to  million as compared to  million in the first quarter and were within our guidance of  million to  million the decrease in expenses was the result of our restructuring that occurred in early march to align spending of revenue as we previously shared we continue to restructure our operations to take expenses out as kevin mentioned we began an outsourcing project early in the second quarter once fully implemented we expect this program will saves us  million annually we expect the transition to be completed by the end of our fiscal year total headcount at the end of the second quarter was  as compared to  at the end of the first quarter and to  at the end of last fiscal year the decrease primarily relates to a reduction in our sales and marketing organization and to a lesser extent rd sales and marketing headcount at the end of the quarter was  versus  last quarter and engineering was  versus  last quarter if you include the  plus developers we have on staff with globallogic our engineering workforce is greater than the prior quarter we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and investments of  million and we had negative cash flows from operations of  million for the second quarter which is on the low side of our guidance of  million to  million for the six months ended july   we utilize  million of our cash to fund our operations based on our current expectations for revenue in gross margin we believe our existing cash balance is insufficient to operate the business for the next  months even as we continue to restructure our operations and reduce spending even further as kevin has mentioned we are actively seeking additional cap further to fund our operations since the end of the second quarter we have reduced our headcount by approximately  we currently believe that our nongaap operating expenses for the third quarter will be between  million and  million we have decided not to provide quarterly guidance for at least the next two quarter as we are undergoing a lot of change including organizational changes and new product launch and reductions in our cost structure until we have better visibility we believe providing quarterly guidance will not be practical i will now turn the call back over to kevin for his closing kevin denuccio thanks cory we learned a lot over the last couple of years and we are taking these learnings including those from our mistakes and making the necessary adjustments we strongly believe that the flash storage platform including the new arrays we are unveiling on september  the maturity of the concerto software and finally our new cloud strategy produce a successful outcome for our employees customers and investors i will now turn the call over to cory to begin the qa cory sindelar operator please compile the queue for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from nehal chokshi with maxim group nehal chokshi yes hi thanks shared a frustration by the way can you talk  i got personal questions as well by the way so let me know so that i may get back into the queue but first do you have an update on oem partnership front kevin denuccio yes i mean the biggest one that we have been working with  we are going to gauge in european theater primarily and couple of big opportunities in the us but i think generally that relationship is not really done to the place where its really producing any meaningful revenue and im not sure its going in the next quarter or two either nehal chokshi okay the breakeven model described  million  million is your breakeven target and did i hear it correctly that the opex rate once the new rationalization of the opex structure will be  million per quarter is that correct kevin denuccio yes under  thats right nehal chokshi under  okay so i backout that that implies total gross margin profile of about  is that correct and then i have followup based on that answer kevin denuccio no i think that its going to be  we think margins will be more in the  to  range probably at that time frame nehal chokshi okay cory sindelar the interest as well nehal chokshi i see okay cory sindelar operating expenses interest as well and i think that will get you to kind of whats the number… kevin denuccio yes it’ll get you about the  million yes nehal chokshi got it okay thats good all right so now regarding the new product that youre going to be  is it going to be released partly ga next week or you just introducing it next week kevin denuccio no its shipping starting next week ga then in data nehal chokshi got it okay now you described that part of the struggle was returning to the revenue ramp was proving that concerto had a maturity that the large enterprises demand and there was hardening process associated with the flash storage platforms kevin denuccio yes nehal chokshi why shouldn’t there be that same hardening process that you went through on version one of fsp as what youll be introducing what ill recall version  next week kevin denuccio yes thats a good question the hardening is really been around the operating system which we launched about  months ago so its been really the process of hardening the os and not really the os’s interaction with the hardware so thats where our challenges has been so we really  we launched product about  months ago and  months ago like last september we began a strategy of really hardening the software and quality that its going to be delivered along with the new platforms next week so we really took the last year to do some extraordinary things in engineering and qa to get that product to where we think it needed to be for these critical applications that we are targeting in the largest companies so its really all around the os and not the interaction between the new arrays themselves or the older arrays its really the operating system itself which is about  million lines of code and thats where we struggled to really get customer confidence because we are going into these mission critical applications that basically they run the business on whether it be inventory and retailer billing teleco or cable companies those kind of things those are the actual wining and they are coming off of zmax from emc that have s architecture so we build the  architecture and it just taken that time to get it hardened and confidence in the customer that they can build the business line nehal chokshi maybe as a frame of reference whats the incremental million lines of code that you had to implement to introduce the new functionalities that you are going to be introducing next week kevin denuccio yes so i think  i don’t have the count of that the new functionality in it is really all around security and encryption so thats really the big pieces of code and been added to it i don’t really have a count of what that was in terms of how much lines of codes have been added but the rest of the hardening has been really more rearchitecting how the software interacts with each piece of the functionality but not necessarily more lines of codes its cleaning up the architecture so that the interaction was more solid between all of the functionality they have in the os nehal chokshi okay great we can move on to another topic gross margin so there is a  million provision for excess and obsolete inventory is it fair that there was a distribution between some that was excess and some that was obsolete or are they absolutely intertwined cory sindelar its mostly excess so a portion of that is fully related systems and some of its component parts but its not obsolescence and so much as it is excess quantities nehal chokshi okay and then i think your inventory ticked down less qoverq than the provision that was taken so i assume that the provision did hit the balance sheet and therefore this does imply that you guys brought in new inventory is that correct cory sindelar of the provision approximately  million of that hit the inventory balance and the other part went into accrued liabilities for component parts that we havent received in yet nehal chokshi i see okay all right so you didn’t taken any new inventory then basically correct cory sindelar correct nehal chokshi okay good and all right  and then that depreciation about  million of that does any of that get record into product cogs cory sindelar no the majority of that would be in rd nehal chokshi okay so then it seems like the  it is a real applestoapples here that product gross margin did tick down from  to  can you talk about why that was then cory sindelar yes i think if you take a look at kind of the overall product revenue relative to prior quarters the cogs is going to be a larger percentage of that cost of goods sold and the second thing is obviously pricing in the quarter probably more aggressive as we were trying to pool in as much revenue as possible to close out the quarter nehal chokshi okay my final question is globallogic deal does globallogic retain any ip rights for the development kevin denuccio no nehal chokshi excellent thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions kevin denuccio well operator then lets go ahead and conclude the call for today thank you everybody for joining us operator thank you for your participation this

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
