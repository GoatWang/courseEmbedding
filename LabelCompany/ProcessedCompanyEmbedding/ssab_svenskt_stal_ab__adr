prestigious steel award university steel prize be a part of the world’s most prestigious steel award me  my city gives the first experience of working life read more february   careers me  my city gives the first experience of working life “me  mycity was such a nice place to work that even during my free time i was still doing business with customers” rasmus hiltunen a sixth grader at ritaharju school in oulu can now write on his cv that he served as ssab’s sales manager for one day at me  mycity rasmus together with other “ssab employees” managed to accumulate € profit for ssab’s virtual cash register in one day “i just went to get a lot of customers to visit our stand and asked whether they needed a new steel roof” rasmus explains his sales strategy located in oulu me  mycity north ostrobothia is the northernmost city and is one of eight me  mycities across finland me  mycity is a finnish education innovation that has received international prizes it is a learning environment a miniature city where around  sixth graders work in an occupation and function as consumers and citizens as part of society for a one day during the school year  me  mycity will be visited by more than  students in finland ssab is a partner of me  mycity north ostrobothnia each day five sixth graders are acting in ssab jobs from factory manager to laboratory employee rasmus thought that the day got off to a bit of a slow start since everything was new and somewhat strange but once the biggest excitement was over the business started to work “i knew that selling is one of my strengths and i didn’t hesitate for a moment whether or not i would be successful in my job a good team spirit was important we had to work together like a sports team” rasmus recalls rasmus clearly has some salesman’s characteristics “i was happy to close so many sales” he says on the other hand rasmus understands that there might be bigger challenges in real life “when i grow up i could imagine myself as a sales manager though it might be a little trickier than here at me  mycity” close equal opportunities we work together with our  employees in more than  countries familiarize
