incorporated on july   delivers fuel cell power solutions the company is engaged in designing manufacturing installing operating and maintaining fuel cell power solutions the company also provides turnkey power generation solutions to the customers including power plant installation operations and maintenance the companys segment is fuel cell power plant production and research the company offers its services to various sectors including utility companies municipalities universities government entities and a range of industrial and commercial enterprises the company by utilizing its direct fuelcell dfc plants is commercializing a trigeneration distributed hydrogen configuration that generates electricity heat and hydrogen for industrial andor transportation uses as well as a fuel cell carbon capture solution for coal or gasfired power plants the company is also developing and commercializing solid oxide fuel cell sofc plants for submegawatt applications to the markets for its megawattclass dfc power plants as well as energy storage applications utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier fuel cells use an electrochemical process to convert a fuel source into electricity and heat in a process that emits virtually no pollutants as the fuel is not burned generating power that is wholly absent of criteria pollutants such as nitrogen oxide nox that causes smog sulfur dioxide sox its power plants provide electricity priced competitively to griddelivered electricity in certain high cost regionsthe companys fuel cell products offer power generation for customers including the  megawatt mw dfc the  mw dfc and  mw dfc plus derivations of this dfc product it can provide a turnkey fuel cell project that includes project development engineering procurement and construction epc services operations and maintenance om and project finance its dfc carbonate fuel cell technology generates electricity directly from a fuel such as natural gas or renewable biogas by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce hydrogen the dfc fuel cell produces byproduct heat that can be utilized for combined heat and power chp applications using hot water steam or chiller water for facility heating and coolingthe dfc product line is a global platform based on carbonate fuel cell technology the companys power plants utilize a range of available fuels to produce electricity electrochemically thus the plants generate more power and fewer emissions for a given unit of fuel than combustionbased power generation of a similar size making them economical and environmentally responsible power generation solutions in addition to electricity the standard configuration produces heat suitable for making steam or hot water for facility use as well as absorption coolingthe

addition we are pursuing research with solid oxide fuel cells as well as hydrogen compression and storagehistoryfuelcell energy’s international reputation for leadership in ultraclean energy solutions has been built on a long history of innovative research and development that reflects the successes of our highly talented and creative workforce we are the first fuel cell manufacturer to commercialize megawattclass stationary fuel cell power plants and we believe that we are the first stationary fuel cell manufacturer to generate a quarterly gross profitlong history of innovation and achievementfuelcell energy traces its roots back to  and the founding of energy research corporation erc by early fuel cell pioneers bernard baker and martin klein both chemical engineers with expertise in advanced battery technologiesin the ′s with funding from the us military and utility companies the company conducted extensive research into lowtemperature fuel cells as well as silverzinc battery cells in the ′s and ′s the company switched its focus to hightemperature carbonate fuel cell systems which offered greater commercial applications due to the ability to internally reform readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas within the fuel cell itself to provide the hydrogen for the power generation processour first commercial power plant was installed in  using a  kilowatt kw fuel cell stack through technology enhancements and cost reductions we have increased the power output of the stacks by  percent to  kw and reduced product costs by more than  percent today we are installing multimegawatt fuel cell plants and fuel cell parks globallythe production facility in torrington connecticut usa was completed in  and produced  megawatts mw

natural gas or renewable biogas virtually no pollution as suresource plants emit only trace levels of nitrogen oxide nox sulfur oxide sox or particulate matter the clean air profile of the suresource product facilitates clean air permitting reducing permitting costs and approval time in fact the suresource  and suresource  are designated as “ultraclean” under  california air resources board carb standards reinforcing the environmental benefits of fuel cells these versatile power generation solutions are available in different sizes and configurations to address a customer’s specific needs configurations include natural gas letdown station energy recovery fuel cell carbon capture distributed hydrogen suresource ™ –  megawatts of clean  affordable power this solution is ideal for onsite power generation for large installations requiring continuous power and value highquality heat for facility heating andor absorption chilling the system is suitable for a wide range of applications including wastewater treatment plants manufacturing facilities hospitals and universities benefits featuring ultralow emissions quiet operation and minimal space requirements about the size of a tennis court the suresource  is suitable for locations where combustionbased traditional power generation technologies are not feasible or desirable such as next to buildings or in spaceconstrained urban locations suresource  suresource ™ –  megawatts of continuous power comprised of two  megawatt mw modules the suresource  generates  mw of ultraclean power similar to the suresource  the system is wellsuited for onsite applications and caters to customers with an even greater power load requirement ideal applications include large universities manufacturing facilities wastewater treatment plants or for multiplant fuel cell parks to support the electric grid benefits the suresource plants are scalable so that multiple systems can be combined to provide tens of megawatts of ultraclean energy to meet a customer’s power demand or to supply directly to the electric grid the clean emissions profile quiet operation and modest space requirements make these fuel cell parks easy to site in urban areas this high power density is exemplified in a fiveunit  mw fuel cell park located in an urban bridgeport connecticut neighborhood that occupies only  acres of land and a unit  mw fuel cell park located in south korea that utilizes just over  acres suresource  suresource ™ –  megawatts of highly efficient power the suresource  is the largest in the suresource power plant fleet and generates  megawatts mw of ultraclean power with an industryleading electrical efficiency of approximately  this enhancedefficiency fuel cell system is designed for utilities large industrial users data centers and other customers focused on clean and affordable power driven by the benefits and economics of high system electrical efficiency unique configuration the standard  megawatt suresource  power plant is comprised of two  megawatt fuel cell modules that operate in parallel  this  megawatt configuration adds a third module that utilizes unused fuel from the other two modules that would normally generate heat and converts this fuel to electricity to produce additional power  the suresource  plant needs only about  square feet or only about ¼ of an acre providing the benefit of siting this power generation solution where the power is used benefits the value proposition for customers and ratepayers is a power plant that can compete with largescale combined cycle gas plants in terms of both efficiency and economics yet virtually eliminates criteria pollutants lends easily to siting in populated and landconstrained areas and installs relatively quickly the versatility and scalability in siting of the suresource  promotes pointofuse installations such as next to existing electrical substations thereby avoiding transmission and the associated line losses from
