there were lots of questions we needed answered when should we put our house on the market how much could we get for it a seemingly endless list then came the question of who should we hire to sell our home we discovered there really wasn’t a good way to find out just who the top agents were we spent hours trying to locate agent information and then hours more trying to make sense of it all after struggling to find useful information we started learning the best ways to do it and found out which parts of the data were really important we boiled all of the information down and made ourselves a very short list of the agents that were the real professionals in our town at that point we could limit our decision making process to choosing the one we felt the most comfortable with after that experience we felt that we could help other people in the same situation so we made the bestagenttodaycom website and the rest is history we became a research organization which is why we call ourselves a ‘research organization’  we’re very clever that way and now we sift through the miles of data about every real estate transaction in your state we’re independent and that means that we don’t play favorites with any brokerage companies we play favorites with consumers we think that you will appreciate the difference you’ve come to the right place finding a top producing real
