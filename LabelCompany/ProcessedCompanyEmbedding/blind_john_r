freedom   turkeyville   how to quit for immediate release  tuesday december   charleston south carolina contact john r polito   editorial glaxosmithkline attacks cold turkey quitting by john r polito whyquit news  tuesday december     est millions of new years quit smoking resolutions are about to be tested and those selling quitting cures want a slice of the pie but how glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare gsk markets nicorette gum the nicoderm patch and the commit nicotine lozenge on december   gsk issued a press release asserting that almost all cold turkey quitters fail what gsks press release conveniently fails to mention is that almost all of its product users fail too that rates for repeat nicotine product users are even worse that nrt studies were not blind as claimed or that cold turkey was the quitting method used by almost all successful longterm exsmokers  roughly  according to gsks press release an estimated three out of four smokers would like to quit and each year about  million smokers do quit for at least one day yet fewer than  of them successfully remain tobaccofree for three to  months most smokers try to quit using cold turkey even though quitting without the right product or support is the lease effective way to succeed studies show nearly all cold turkey quit attempts  percent fail now for the rest of the story all realworld quitting surveys continue to find that outside of clinical studies which were allegedly doubleblind quitters buying and using replacement nicotine products such as the gum patch and lozenge have yet to perform better than those quitting cold turkey an extensive review of california quitter survey data was published in the september   issue of the journal of the american medical association jama it concluded that nrt appears no longer effective in increasing longterm successful cessation in california smokers subsequent smoker quitting surveys in minnesota london quebec and maryland continue to confirm the california findings in no quitter suvery assessing cessation at six months or beyond have those quitting while using nrt products performed better than those quitting entirely on their own but recently replacement nicotine has failed to measure up to marketing hype even in rather intense ongoing support settings a study entitled the english smoking treatment services oneyear outcomes was published in the april  issue of addiction it examines chemically validated quit smoking rates after one year for quitters who received oneonone counseling or group treatment for up to eight weeks table six of the english study compares quitting rates for various quitting methods it shows that  of those who employed willpower and did not use any pharmaceutical quitting product were still not smoking at one year in stark contrast only  who used nrt were still not smoking at one year by almost any measure the wording of gkss press release grossly distorts americas quitting picture first it implies that  of all quitters are able to quit for one year while only  of cold turkey quitters succeed in doing so this is a horrible example of just how low pharmaceutical interests will stoop in attempting to obtain market share from americas most productive quitting method those marketing quit smoking products almost invariably attribute the lowest oneyear quitting rate they can locate to cold turkey usually  to   as gsk has done  and then conveniently fail to tell readers the oneyear quitting rate for their own product in fact almost all objective quitting authorities include cold turkey quitters within the historic  oneyear quitting rate that weve each heard for decades look closely at the glaxosmithkline press release after assigning  to cold turkey isnt it interesting that gsk never once mentions the one year quit smoking rate for its nicotine gum patch or lozenge gsk isnt stupid it knows that such openness and honesty would kill its golden nicotine producing goose the oneyear quitting rate for overthecounter nicotine products is one of the worlds best kept secrets what we do know is the sixmonth rate as determined by paid consultants to glaxosmithkline dr hughes and shiffman their march  study published in tobacco control combined and averaged the results of the seven overthecounter nicotine patch and gum studies the study disclosure states dr hughes has received speaking and consulting fees and grants from glaxosmithkline  dr shiffman serves as a consultant to glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare gskch on an exclusive basis regarding matters relating to smoking cessation dr hughes and shiffman found that on average just  of overthecounter otc nicotine patch and gum study participants were still not smoking at six months if only  of nrt users are still not smoking at six months then how many succeed in quitting for one year the only way to make an educated guess is to look at older nonotc clinical studies in those studies it wasnt at all unusual to see  of successful sixmonth nrt quitters relapse to smoking between  months and one year if a  relapse rate is applied to the  sixmonth rate then only  of overthecounter patch and gum quitters are still not smoking at one year if the  figure is anywhere near accurate imagine the average smokers reaction to a gsk press release asserting that  of nrt quitters quit smoking for one year versus only  of cold turkey quitters it would suggest why gsk would not want cold turkey quitters to be part of the  oneyear quitting rate noted in its release its beyond time for the entire pharmaceutical industry to begin leveling with smokers about their odds while using overthecounter nicotine quitting products they need to come clean about two other important factors it needs to be widely known that unlike repeat attempts at cold turkey quitting a quitters odds of success actually decline with repeat nrt use they also should stop telling quitters that doubleblind clinical studies have proven that nrt doubles their chances when they know that the studies were not blind as claimed if you have already tried quitting with the nicotine patch once then what are your odds during a second or subsequent patch attempt only two nicotine patch studies have ever looked at what the nrt industry terms recycling a  study tonnesen found that  of secondtime patch users succeeded in quitting for  months and a  study gourlay reported a  sixmonth quitting rate but why almost all online quit smoking authorities carry statements such as this one from the us centers for disease control nicotine is a very addictive drug and usually people make two or three tries or more before they successfully quit each time you try to quit you can learn what works for you and what situations are problematic the key lesson eventually learned is the amazing power of one puff of nicotine to completely destroy a quitting attempt its called the law of addiction eventually successful quitters learn to stop treating their dependency as though it were some nasty little habit capable of being controlled or manipulated and start treating it like a true chemical addiction but what lesson could possibly be learned from repeat toying with pharmaceutical grade nicotine the tonnesen and gourlay studies suggest none its why even with an extremely low  one year quitting rate for uneducated and unsupported cold turkey quitters an endless river of cold turkey school of hardquittingknocks learning leads to ocean of success  of all successful quitters while nrts river of attempts trickle into insignificance before almost totally evaporating it is also time for the pharmaceutical industry to stop and reflect upon whether or not it is false and deceptive advertising to continue to tell smokers that nrt doubles their chances when it knows that those odds ratio victories were generated by studies that were not blind as claimed the industry knew since the first nicotine gum studies in the early s that it had serious study blinding concerns on its hands nicotine is a psychoactive chemical producing alert dopamineadrenaline intoxication smokers with any prior quitting history know what its like to have their expectations of receiving nicotine fulfilled or denied smokers were often coaxed into quitting studies by being promised a  chance of receiving weeks or months of free replacement nicotine products half were randomly assigned to receive an inert placebo and the other half the real mccoy  pharmaceutical grade nicotine how many minutes would it have taken any experienced quitter to determine whether or not their gum contained nicotine would frustrated and fulfilled expectations have impacted both placebo group dropout rates and rates for active group members who decided to remain in many early studies counseling telephone support andor group therapy  interventions with proven effectiveness  were offered for weeks or sometimes months when most of the placebo group droppedout of the study within the first couple of weeks a study appearing in the june  edition of addictive behaviors identified  doubleblind placebo controlled nrt trials and found that only  had conducted blinding assessments during assessments participants were asked to surmise whether they had been using a real nicotine delivery device or an empty placebo according to the authors  of the  studies  reported blinding failures as subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance if true and nrt studies were not blind as claimed should the pharmaceutical industry continue to assert that nrt doubles a quitters chances when there is absolutely no credible evidence that those odds ratio victories reflect anything other than frustrated and fulfilled participant expectations if you are among the  who previously succeeded in quitting longterm with nrt before later relapsing and want to give it another shot then by all means go for it but if you are among the  out of  prior patch or gum users who relapsed to smoking within six months then you have every right to know that your odds of success during a second attempt would be vastly

cmaj shares a letter submitted by this writer john r polito which contends that the onset or absence of physical withdrawal destroys blinding that pharmacologic treatment of chemical dependency may be the only known research area in which blinding is impossible cessation pharmacology experts responded to the letter by asserting that blinding is undoubtedly a key component of the validity of inferences drawn from randomized controlled trials and that maintaining blinding may be difficult particularly if study participants experience withdrawal symptoms the experts closed by asserting that incomplete blinding is a potential limitation to most clinical trials i responded pointing out how smoking cessation clincal trials differ from most clinical trials if successful study blinding is key to the scientific validity of  years of pharmacology study findings then why is no expert willing to assert that nrt zyban or chantix studies have been blind frankly they cant the only study to review clinical trials that assessed blinding was published in  it found that subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance pharmaceutical quitting products easily and routinely defeat placebo users inside clinical trials yet fall flat on their face when going headtohead against cold turkey quitters in realworld use see this july  gallup poll this chart from pierce

overthecounter sales on effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids for smoking cessation free full text jama september   clearly placebo is not a real quitting method and cold turkey quitters normally do not join clinical studies seeking medications that promise to lessen their withdrawal syndrome their objective is to endure withdrawal and move beyond it while the pharmacology quitting product era promised to double quitting rates it has instead brought decline in the us smoking rate to a standstill how many thousands of smokers repeatedly believed the double your chances slogan repeatedly relied on it in using medicines and died trying how many believed that the quitting aid they purchased had been scientifically proven to be the best option available the question at the center of the debate is really rather simple can a nicotine addict who is badly in need of nicotine fix tell whether or not nicotine replenishment has occurred if so and they can do so within a few hours of quitting have researchers been honest in labeling their studies blind and declaring them sciencebased principle  of the world medical associations wma declaration of helsinki commands that the benefits risks burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention and that placebos should not be used unless compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons are demonstrated the pharmaceutical industry and fda contend that nicotine gum was proven effective prior to  if true why the need for  placebo controlled trials since  is it because placebo is easiest to beat or that stockholders are more important than the lives of the tens of thousands smokers assigned to placebos since  if researchers refuse to honor the smokers human rights do they assume responsibility for the demise of relapsing placebo users left so demoralized that there wasnt sufficient time prior to being claimed by their addiction to muster the confidence to try a truly effective method the problem is that us cessation research is an utter mess that locating a clincal trial involving real cold turkey quitters is nearly impossible any researcher whose research findings damage pharmaceutical industry financial interests can probably forget industry study funding for the rest of their life we need common sense laws and ethics that protect the independence and integrity of clincal trial researchers we need greater government funding of research thats medically indicated not just research with potential to handsomely reward corporate shareholders our nations leading cause of premature demise the time is now for serious and immediate independent research into whether or not  placebo controlled quit smoking studies reflect

the blind during the past century advances in technology such as talking books faster production of braille access to computers and the internet and reading machines have afforded the blind better access to the world around them in spite of the advances of the last twentyfive years developments in consumer electronics technology have made consumer electronics difficult or often impossible to operate without vision leaving blind people unable to perform seemingly routine tasks the problem until the past couple of decades blind people could operate virtually all electronic devices intended for the broad consumer market even those of a highly specialized nature in contrast todays home electronic devices use multilevel menus providing only visual feedback by which all tasks are performed rather than making access easier new technology is complicating and oftentimes prohibiting access for the blind however it does not have to be this way due to computerized control systems devices such as todays audiovideo receivers have become much more complicated than similarly priced units of twenty years ago besides the development of microprocessorbased control and switching systems this increased capability has been accomplished through multifunction control buttons menu systems and displays that can convey a variety of information while some of todays costsaving designs can annoy sighted people they actually prohibit the enjoyment of home entertainment by the blind well into the s the average blind consumer could operate the typical stereo system without help the use of braille labels and other tactilely discernable markings filing a notch or painting nail polish on a dial allowed blind consumers to easily adjust the many settings of a stereo in addition the status of switches could be determined by touch using their physical position in or out up or down etc with each performing known consistent functions todays stereos may contain knobs and switches but their use is not intuitive through nonvisual means for example a volume control knob may rotate continuously providing no indication of volume level when one presses the on button will the sound be produced at the level of the last noisy party although some devices possess jog wheels with discernible clicks which theoretically render them accessible to the blind these clicks often do not provide reliable information to the blind about the settings this is because the electronics do not consistently register all the clicks making the clicks just another frustration for the blind while sequences of button presses can sometimes be memorized this is only possible after extensive experimentation and research with the aid of a sighted person to make matters worse many of todays devices simply have too many functions to memorize additionally some functions can only be addressed by answering inaccessible screen prompts tvs and dvd players are other examples of home electronic equipment that now provide challenges for use by the blind menus and channel information are displayed onscreen and the user has to navigate through the multilevel menus with the remote control even such basic audio controls as adjustments of tone and balance on some televisions are submerged two or three levels deep in onscreen menus separate dedicated knobs for these functions have largely disappeared the chances of successfully entering a program into todays tvs dvd players tivo boxes and the like are remote without the benefit of prompts and access to the onscreen menus home appliances which have long been easily usable by the blind are like home theatre equipment becoming less so every day as more and more of them introduce touch panels and layered menus refrigerators with touch panels can be hard to label and often provide no audio or tactile feedback and without a clearcancel button that makes it impossible for a blind user to detect the current settings many washers and dryers use menus that you cycle through and which give you no feedback when you reach the end or beginning  and so it becomes tough to do something as simple as set the load size or soil level the market as the baby boomers  the largest consumer group in the united states which even in the current climate preserves much of its discretionary spending power  age agerelated blindness and low vision become evermore common conservative estimates suggest that by  there will be  million blind seniors people aged  and over alone the number of americans with low vision has already reached  million  million of low vision americans are seniors and this number is expected to double by  the market in specialized products for low vision and blind seniors such as video magnification and reading machines has grown rapidly but the mainstream market has lagged leaving this growing section of the baby boomers unserved working toward a solution those who are blind or low vision purchase and utilize consumer electronics like everyone else however for this group the decision over which product to spend their money on is tightly linked to which one will provide the greatest level of independence in its usability our experience is that those we find most usable as blind people are also highly usable and desirable by many other consumers therefore we believe that nonvisual access features improve product usability in the general market placea true winwin mark riccobono executive director of the nfb jernigan institute the jernigan institute provides leadership in sharing best practices in nonvisual access to consumer electronics we believe that testing appliances for nonvisual access at an early stage not only ensures a broader appeal for the product without necessarily adding to the cost but also provides all consumers with a more user friendly device the jernigan institute offers manufacturers to opportunity to improve their product with our help with the experiences of the nfb membership to support it the jernigan institute brings unparalleled expertise in nonvisual access to the table since the inception of the institute we have consulted on a number of products from the earliest development and design stages and have organized user testing for these products there are many examples of technologies that originated in nonvisual access and which now benefit all consumers  optical character recognition flatbed scanners and audiobooks are only a few of the examples available in the market now in the jernigan institute manufacturers of consumer electronics and blind users now have a common resource available to continue this tradition of technological innovation and to make sure that a good product reaches the largest possible group of consumers as the largest and most trusted organization of blind people the nfb is a logical choice as a partner in reaching out to this underserved population and its untapped discretionary income we invite manufacturers interested in making accessible consumer electronics to join the dialogue and get direct feedback from experts in the blind community we can provide user testing on existing electronics which the manufacturer considers or believes to be usable we also disseminate information on consumer electronics that prove usable to the nfb membership the nfb jernigan institute hosts the accessible home showcase a facility displaying a selection of usable mainstream consumer electronics where manufacturers and users alike can explore different ways to achieve nonvisual accessibility
