class by our most senior investment professionals over the shorter term however your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks and

other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral
