chicago illinois hartline began its investment management business with  institutional clients and  million in assets under management since then hartline has added services for individuals and families and has grown rapidly primarily by referral in addition to the chicago headquarters hartline has added a second office in kenilworth illinois and intends to soon open a third office in

currently hartline manages approximately  million in clients’ assets in arizona kansas nebraska washington oregon california texas colorado montana missouri michigan illinois indiana new york west virginia and florida the hartline name is an extension of william hart’s last name combined with line the term hart dates back to an old english word used to denote a male deer typically a mature red deer the old english term is carried on today as an element of hartline’s logo the line portion of the title signifies a way of thinking as in line of thought and as an element of charting course and establishing direction the line on the map that traces the journey in this case of financial success is different for everyone the hart line is simply the personal line to each client’s objectives the logo of two harts charging against one another expresses the dichotomies of investing in contrast to the bull and the bear that describe markets in terms of direction the harts depict conflicting alternatives that are not necessarily good or bad but simply the opposite sides of an issue it may be the established versus the innovative or the risk versus the return many important investing decisions result from consideration of the conflicting choices resolving alternatives or combining opposing forces focuses attention on the critical issues in the purchase or sale decision help terms
