home   view bmi trend   meridian m fetal monitoring system meridians patented technology is fda cleared to take the place of not only doppler and tocometry but also fetal scalp electrode and the intrauterine pressure catheter it is no longer necessary to weigh the advantage of invasive monitoring with the risk of infection meridian m provides goldstandard signal without the risk of invasive monitoring at a time when the average bmi of obstetric patients is rising and clinical excellence demands reliable fetal heart rate and contraction signals from all patients meridian m is the only fetal monitor on the market that performs as well in obese patients as it does in lean patients both the fetal heart rate signal and the contraction signal deteriorate when bmi increases compromising obstetric safety meridian m solves this problem with improved technology raising the safety profile of your unit download data sheet download data sheet meridian m disposable electrode patch the meridian m disposable electrode patch eliminates the need for skin preparation before use while providing outstanding performance and reliability across the full range of patient bmi anticipated during labor and delivery the meridian m disposable electrode patch replaces the fetal scalp electrode intrauterine pressure catheter dopper and toco sensors with a single noninvasive disposable system while maintaining the same accuracy and sensitivity performance expected of today’s monitoring devices frequent repositioning associated with existing noninvasive monitoring is eliminated as well as the risk of infection associated with invasive monitoring the meridian m disposable electrode patch consists of four patches two for the mother’s abdomen and one for each of her sides which provides continuous fetal signal capture during fetal movement with complete abdominal coverage the meridian m disposable electrode patch delivers accurate and detailed fetal maternal and uterine monitoring setting a new gold standard in fetal monitoring sensor technology download publications meridian m monitors the fetal ecg electrocardiogram ecg monitoring has been widely used on adult patients for decades in adults signals representing a patient’s cardiac activities are collected through a set of skin surface electrodes distributed over the patient’s body monitoring of fetal ecg fecg in this manner however can be difficult due to the coexistence of maternal and fetal signals acquired from a patient as well as the relatively low fetal signal level relative to the maternal signal and other noise sources mindchild has developed the meridian m fetal monitoring system which is a device that utilizes external electrodes and a proprietary algorithm to discern between fetal and maternal signals allowing for an external noninvasive device to calculate the fetal heart rate the meridian m fhr sentinel monitoring the meridian m fetal monitoring system overcomes a major safety hazard of traditional monitoring  the inability of doppler technology to distinguish the maternal heart rate from the fetal heart rate when the mother and and the fetuss heart rates are similar by tracking each signal independently using a dedicated maternal ecg lead meridian m fhr sentineltm technology eliminates the risk meridian m improves quality of interaction between nurse and mother the meridian m eliminates the nursing time required to reposition the fetal monitoring transducer the meridian m monitor eliminates transducer adjustment by automating sensor selection within the meridian m disposable electrode patch in fact workflow analysis suggests that use of meridian m reduces nursing work by  hours per labor episode this advantage is particularly pronounced when monitoring obese patients fetal movement maternal position and adipose tissue conspire to make fetal monitoring a fulltime job for the covering nurse meridian m eliminates this handson work freeing nursing staff to focus on more important aspects of patient care competitive advantages versus established technologies indications for use the meridian m fetal monitoring system is an intrapartum

fda cleared to take the place of not only doppler and tocometry but also fetal scalp electrode and the intrauterine pressure catheter it is no longer necessary to weigh the advantage of invasive monitoring with the risk of infection meridian m provides goldstandard signal without the risk of invasive monitoring at a time when the average bmi of obstetric patients is rising and clinical excellence demands reliable fetal heart rate and contraction signals from all patients meridian m is the only fetal monitor on the market that performs as well in obese patients as it does in lean patients both the fetal heart rate signal and the contraction signal deteriorate when bmi increases compromising obstetric safety meridian m solves this problem with improved technology raising the safety profile of your unit download data sheet download data sheet meridian m disposable electrode patch the meridian m disposable electrode patch eliminates the need for skin preparation before use while providing outstanding performance and reliability across the full range of patient bmi anticipated during labor and delivery the meridian m disposable electrode patch replaces the fetal scalp electrode intrauterine pressure catheter dopper and toco sensors with a single noninvasive disposable system while maintaining the same accuracy and sensitivity performance expected of today’s monitoring devices frequent repositioning associated with existing noninvasive monitoring is eliminated as well as the risk of infection associated with invasive monitoring the meridian m disposable electrode patch consists of four patches two for the mother’s abdomen and one for each of her sides which provides continuous fetal signal capture during fetal movement with complete abdominal coverage the meridian m disposable electrode patch delivers accurate and detailed fetal maternal and uterine monitoring setting a new gold standard in fetal monitoring sensor technology download publications meridian m monitors the fetal ecg electrocardiogram ecg monitoring has been widely used on adult patients for decades in adults signals representing a patient’s cardiac activities are collected through a set of skin surface electrodes distributed over the patient’s body monitoring of fetal ecg fecg in this manner however can be difficult due to the coexistence of maternal and fetal signals acquired from a patient as well as the relatively low fetal signal level relative to the maternal signal and other noise sources mindchild has developed the meridian m fetal monitoring system which is a device that utilizes external electrodes and a proprietary algorithm to discern between fetal and maternal signals allowing for an external noninvasive device to calculate the fetal heart rate the meridian m fhr sentinel monitoring the meridian m fetal monitoring system overcomes a major safety hazard of traditional monitoring  the inability of doppler technology to distinguish the maternal heart rate from the fetal heart rate when the mother and and the fetuss heart rates are similar by tracking each signal independently using a dedicated maternal ecg lead meridian m fhr sentineltm technology eliminates the risk meridian m improves quality of interaction between nurse and mother the meridian m eliminates the nursing time required to reposition the fetal monitoring transducer the meridian m monitor eliminates transducer adjustment by automating sensor selection within the meridian m disposable electrode patch in fact workflow analysis suggests that use of meridian m reduces nursing work by  hours per labor episode this advantage is particularly pronounced when monitoring obese patients fetal movement maternal position and adipose tissue conspire to make fetal monitoring a fulltime job for the covering nurse meridian m eliminates this handson work freeing nursing staff to focus on more important aspects of patient care competitive advantages versus established technologies indications for use the meridian m fetal monitoring system is an intrapartum fetal monitor that externally measures and displays fetal heart rate fhr maternal heart rate mhr and uterine contractions ua the meridian m fetal monitoring system acquires and displays the fhr and ua from abdominal surface electrodes that detect the fetal ecg signals maternal ecg signals and of uterine muscle contraction signals tracings of fhr and ua are displayed onto a primary fetal monitor the meridian m fetal monitoring system is indicated for use on women who are at ≥  completed weeks in labor with singleton pregnancies using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen the mindchild meridian m is intended for use by health care professionals in a clinical setting to
