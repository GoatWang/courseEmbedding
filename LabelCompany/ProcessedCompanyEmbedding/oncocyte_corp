products  oncocyte corporation products products andria day t products oncocyte corporation is focused on developing diagnostics to address the unmet needs in the detection and screening of lung breast and bladder cancers current imaging diagnostic procedures in screening lung breast and bladder cancer are not meeting the needs of health care providers patients or payers in that they often produce indeterminate diagnoses due to the high level of false positives these indeterminate diagnoses can result in physician uncertainty on whether downstream procedures are needed patient angst and concern about whether or not they have cancer unnecessary downstream procedures adding incremental costs to health care spend eg bronchoscopies cystoscopies biopsies as molecular diagnostics evolve from tissue based to liquid biopsy based fewer downstream procedures will be required resulting in cost savings earlier diagnosis and decreased risks to the patient oncocyte is developing proprietary
