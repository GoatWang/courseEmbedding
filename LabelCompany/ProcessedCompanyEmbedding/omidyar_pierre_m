merging — there was a real reduction in reporting capacity and so i felt it was critical to just build a newsroom that is exclusively focused on public affairs i wanted to get my hands dirty learning what it’s like to work with journalists and editors day in and day out to see how the sausage is made through that experience i saw firsthand the impact that really good investigative stories have at every level and so this is the next step in a very long journeyq this next step seems focused on secrecy and transparency what pulled you in that directiona a number of things happened even before the snowden leaks we saw a number of what i would characterize as missteps by the justice department we saw the justice department wiretap the ap newsroom we saw fox news reporter james rosen being labeled as coconspirator label in affidavits we see the many leak prosecutions including the use of the espionage act it alerted me to the fact that even in this great country of ours with this fantastic constitution there’s a real pressure against press freedoms that’s going on perhaps unintentionally in the hot pursuit of leakers and trying to protect secrets we are really putting pressure on press freedom here when you have mass surveillance it’s impossible to meet the intent of the first amendment because reporters can’t talk to sources because sources are afraid to talk newsletter

posta in may we started a deep engagement in the process of looking at buying the washington post ultimately i started thinking about other uses of that level of capital i learned at civil beat that a large part of driving the conversation forward is having voices based in expertise as well as passion for the topic that’s what really drove me to thinking about people like glenn greenwald and laura poitras and jeremy scahill they are people who are willing to put themselves out there and be transparent about it not just spouting opinions without any kind of basis they say “look i know about this stuff this is how i know about it here’s what i’ve learned and i’m going to tell you what i think about this”q so what do you bring to the table besides moneya technologists come at a problem from the point of view that the system is working a certain way and if i engage in that system and actually change the rules of the system i can make it work a different way if you think about what did google do what did facebook do what did twitter do what did ebay do they all created systems that changed the way the world works at a very large scale and i would hypothesize that perhaps some of the interest in media simply reflects a desire to be engaged in the worldq by doing whata we want to do a better job bringing important investigative stories or deep human stories that tend to be overlooked to a broader audience and we can use technology to figure out how to do that it isn’t as simple as just throwing something in their faces about an important issue that’s just like a public service ad and will likely be ignoredtechnologists understand our users and break down how user engagement increases from somebody that maybe just tries your product once and then goes away to a different kind of person that progressively gets more and more engaged and then becomes just totally locked into your product that’s something people in silicon valley spend a ton of time analyzing working on and thinking aboutq do you think that serious journalism can paya i think on its own probably not certainly the learning from our site in hawaii shows how difficult it is advertisers don’t want to put their ads next to the investigative story it’s extremely difficult to do that and very few people today actually read those serious news stories on the web now the audience for the most important stories can be depressingly small there will always be a core of readers willing to support that work but it is a tiny tiny percentage of broader society that’s part of the reason we are doing a generalinterest site to work on how we get a generalinterest audience to become engaged citizensq so how are you going to go about thata we are way too early we landed here a little bit unexpectedly in terms of talking about this publicly glenn and i have been together on this project for just over two weeks now advertisement continue reading the main story q it was interesting to watch glenn greenwald deal with the consequences of a leaka it was um very ironic correction october   an earlier version of this interview misstated the given name of one of mr omidyar’s partners in the news venture in the first reference as correctly noted later he is jeremy scahill not jeffrey continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think
