compared   to   msci   china   down      and   topix   down      through   september   in   october   and   november   the   fund   was   up   an   estimated      gross   and   net   bringing   our

the   fund   has   managed   through   the   volatile   markets   so   far   this   year   to   deliver   essentially   flat   performance   outperforming   the   markets   on   a   relative   basis   and   protecting   capital   which   sets   up   the   fund   with   a   portfolio   that   has   significant   upside   potential   in      on   the   positive   side   the   fund   has   been   able   to   generate   alpha   on   both   the   long   and   short   side   this   year   we’ve   had   a   fairly   high   hit   ratio   on   our   single   name   longs   and   shorts   which   has   produced   the   fund’s   flattish   performance   despite   having   average   net   equity   exposure   of     ‐    for   the   year   in   particular   sun   art   brilliance   aiful   and   qr   national   have   been   large   contributors   on   the   long   side   and   on   the   short   side   taiwanese   airlines   construction   machinery   and   the   heavy   duty   truck   segment   in   china   have   worked   out   well   what   we   have   gotten   wrong   is   our   large   net   exposure   to   the   equity   markets   which   was   the   reason   for   the   fund’s   drawdown   in   august   and   september   we   did   not   have   single   names   that   performed   disproportionately   worse   than   their   beta ‐ exposure   would   suggest   nor   did   we   have   an   issue   with   our   gross   exposures   we   were   simply   too   net   long   going   into   a   severe   downturn   in   the   equity   markets   inception   date   was   july         the   graph   above   reflects   the   composition   of    owl   creek   asia   master   fund   ltds   portfolio   at   each   month   end   the   composition   of    the   portfolio   will   vary   daily   exposure   includes   the   notional   exposure   of    total   return   swaps   and   futures   contracts   as   we   have   written   about   in   our   previous   letters   we   believed   this   exposure   was    justified   because   of    the   compelling   and   event ‐ driven   nature   of    the   bottoms ‐ up   opportunities   we   found   and   our   top   down   view   that   the   markets   would   do   okay   while   we   have   gotten   the   bottoms ‐ up   mostly   right   our   top   down   view   has   clearly   been   wrong   this   year   we’ve   always   believed   our   strengths   are   in   the   bottoms   up   the   micro…   the   alpha   but   by   having   such   a   large   net   equity   exposure   we   were   making   implicit   bets   on   the   macro…   on   the   beta…   that   we’ve   had   less   conviction   in   we   feel   that   by   having   a   smaller   net   exposure   our   performance   will   be   more   representative   of    our   strengths   and   that   we   will   also   be   able   to   manage   through   the   volatility   of    the   markets   more   effectively   we   remain   long ‐ biased   and   do   want   some   market   exposure   but   given   how   uncertain   we   expect   the   macro   environment   to   remain   for   the   foreseeable   future   years   not   months   we   think   it   is   prudent   to   run   with   smaller   nets   going   forward   so   we   expect   to   run   with      a   narrower   range   of    net   equity   exposure   going   forward   in   the    ‐    range   versus   our   historical   range   of    about    ‐    at   the   end   of    november   our   net   equity   exposure   was   approximately      we   continue   to   like   the   micro   stories   behind   our   names   on   both   the   long   and   short   side   and   feel   that   the   market   is   pricing   in   a   much   higher   likelihood   of    a   china   hard   landing   than   we   believe   is   warranted   over   the   last   three   months   we   have   visited   about   half    of    our   portfolio   companies   and   have   spoken   with   all   of    them   and   feel   strongly   that   our   investment   theses   are   largely   unchanged   we   have   used   the   recent   volatility   in   these   markets   to   adjust   our   portfolio   adding   to   high   conviction   names   such   as   china   shanshui   visteon   far   east   horizon   and   hui   xian   reit   while   also   trimming   our   winners   such   as   picc   and   brilliance   we’ve   added   a   number   of    single   name   shorts   across   the   construction   machinery   consumer   and   telecom   sectors   to   replace   the   index   hedges   we   put   on   over   the   last   few   months   single   name   shorts   currently   represent   about      of    our   short   book   while   the   external   environment   europe   and   us   continues   to   drive   liquidity   and   the   markets   in   asia   china   remains   very   much   in   flux   as   the   year   long   tightening   by   the   central   government   has   had   its   desired   effect   a   slowing   chinese   economy   and   lower   inflation   cpi   in   october   was      down   from   the   peak   of       in   july   and   we   expect   it   to   be   around      by   the   beginning   of       while   the   very   early   stages   of    easing   are   starting   liquidity   conditions   remain   tight   in   china   property   sales   continue   to   slow   and   housing   inventories   rise   with   the   home   purchase   restriction   being   the   primary   limiting   factor   we   expect   the   next   internal   catalyst   for   the   chinese   market   to   be   easing   in   some   form   of    reserve   rate   requirement   cuts   a   loosening   in   housing   and   fiscal   stimulus   we   remain   convinced   that   a   hard   landing   in   china   is   not   in   the   cards   as   the   slowdown   is   primarily   self  ‐ inflicted   through   the   tightening   which   leaves   the   government   room   to   ease   china’s   position   contrasts   starkly   with   both   europe   and   the   us   who   have   zero   bound   interest   rates   and   huge   budget   deficits   which   makes   both   monetary   and   fiscal   stimulus   exceedingly   difficult   on   november      china   announced   a   cut   in   its   reserve   rate   requirement   by      bps   which   in   isolation   is   not   that   impactful   but
