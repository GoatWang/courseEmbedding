value columns show end of year values all values are shown rounded to the nearest dollar and reflect any policy loans illustrated none in this case the calculation for the accumulation value is the accumulated premiums with the assumed investment return less all charges the value shown for any particular year depends on all prior years premiums and charges for the th policy year under the  percent gross return assumption the end of the th year cash value  is used as the starting point additions of premiums less charges against premiums are added at the beginning of each month in this case premiums are assumed to be paid annually so in the first month the premium of  less the premium charge  percent of premium or  is added in the first month that amount is  after the premium less charges is added at the beginning of the month the monthly policy charge the policy issue charge the mortality and expense me risk charge and the cost of insurance charge are next deducted from the accumulation value the accumulation value then grows at the assumed net rate of return to the end of the month the net annual returns are derived from the hypothetical gross rates of return by deducting the sum of the average investment management fee  percent average fund expense  percent average b distribution fee  percent and then increasing that amount by the average unit value credit  percent in this case the assumed net rate of return is  percent which translates into a monthly assumed growth rate of  percent       the monthly policy charge is  the policy issue charge recovers the expense of issuing underwriting and distributing the policy the amount of the policy issue charge is shown on the policy data pages of the policy the me risk charge is equal to  percent of the accumulation value at the beginning of the month the cost of insurance charge is calculated as the coi rate for the illustrated insured multiplied by the net amount at risk of the policy the net amount at risk is the death benefit divided by the net amount at risk divisor also shown on the policy data pages less the accumulation value this process is rolled forward monthly until the end of the policy year to get the end of year accumulation value shown the table below details these calculations for the th policy year the death benefit is calculated as the greater of the face amount selected and the minimum death benefit required to qualify as life insurance this amount would be reduced by any policy loan balance at that time for the th policy year under the  percent gross return assumption the death benefit shown is  the minimum amount of insurance to qualify as life insurance is the end of the th year accumulation value multiplied by the guideline premium test death benefit corridor factor since this sample illustration uses the guideline premium test for life insurance the corridor factor in this case is  the minimum death benefit amount in order to qualify for life insurance is therefore      so in this case the death benefit is equal to the selected face amount the calculation would not differ in other years although the accumulation value and death benefit

policy and to give you a brief overview of the more significant features of the policy the summary is not comprehensive and you should review the information contained elsewhere in this prospectus this prospectus describes a flexible premium variable universal life insurance policy called accumulator vul as the policy owner you can exercise all the rights under the policy including the right to change the owner the beneficiary and to make other policy changes the policy combines both life insurance protection and the potential for the accumulation of cash values the policy is not suitable as a shortterm investment vehicle you can lose some or all of your money what are some of the benefits of the policy the policy allows for the growth of accumulation value while life insurance coverage remains in force and permits the flexible payment of premiums the accumulation value of the policy will fluctuate with the investment performance of the subaccounts of the account you may transfer accumulation value among the subaccounts and the guaranteed interest account surrender all or part of your accumulation value under the policy and take policy loans subject to the limitations described in this prospectus each policy has a face amount however the death benefit payable upon the death of the insured may be greater than the face amount as described later in this prospectus we offer seven agreements that provide supplemental insurance benefits under the policy accelerated benefit death benefit guarantee family term  children overloan protection term insurance waiver of charges and waiver of premium agreements there is no charge for the accelerated benefit agreement the agreements may not be available in all states we also offer several ways of receiving death benefit proceeds under the policy other than in a lump sum information concerning the settlement options available under the policy is set forth later in this prospectus and in the statement of additional information that we will provide you upon request see statement of additional information section to this prospectus in general under the internal revenue code the code the death benefit payable under a qualifying life insurance policy is excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary and the owner would not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the accumulation value of the policy until there is a distribution this means that under a qualifying life insurance policy accumulation value builds up on a tax deferred basis and transfers of accumulation value among the available investment options under the policy may be made tax free this policy is designed to afford the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under the code how can the policy be changed the policy allows you the flexibility to tailor your policy to your needs at issue and to change your policy thereafter as your insurance needs change within very broad limits including those designed to assure that the policy qualifies as life insurance for tax purposes you may choose the level of premium you wish to pay the face amount and death benefit option under the policy what makes the policy variable the policy is called variable because unlike traditional whole life and universal life contracts which provide for accumulation of contract values at fixed rates determined by the insurance company the accumulation value of the policy may be invested in the subaccounts of the account in turn each subaccount invests exclusively in a corresponding portfolio of a fund thus your accumulation value  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th to the extent invested in a subaccount will vary with the positive or negative investment experience of the corresponding portfolio if you seek a fixed return on your accumulation value you can allocate premiums and accumulation value to the guaranteed interest account which credits a fixed rate of interest and is part of minnesota lifes general account see individual variable universal life account and the funds on page  with the guaranteed interest account you do not bear the risk that adverse investment performance will lower your accumulation value invested in that account see the guaranteed interest account and the loan account on page  what death benefit options are offered under the policy the policy provides three death benefit options the level option the increasing option and the sum of premiums option under the level option the death benefit is the face amount of the policy if the level option is in effect the death benefit payable will not be affected by either the negative or positive investment performance of the investment options under the increasing option the death benefit equals the face amount of the policy plus the accumulation value at the time of death of the insured if the increasing option is in effect the death benefit payable will reflect the investment performance of the investment options in which accumulation value has been invested the sum of premiums option provides a death benefit equal to the face amount of the policy plus the sum of all premiums paid less the sum of all partial surrenders if the sum of premiums option is in effect the death benefit payable will not be affected by either the negative or positive investment performance of the investment options see death benefit options on page  in order for your policy to be considered life insurance under code section  it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test unless you specify otherwise the death benefit qualification test for this policy is the guideline premium test the death benefit qualification test is shown on the policy data pages and cannot be changed in order to ensure the policy continues to satisfy the definition of life insurance under code section  we may need to adjust the amount of death benefit payable under the death benefit option you have chosen do you have access to your accumulation value yes you may transfer accumulation value among the available investment options or surrender the policy at any time you may also make a partial surrender of the accumulation value of the policy after the first policy year a surrender or partial surrender may have federal tax consequences see federal tax status on page  a surrender charge may apply if you surrender the policy if you request a partial surrender we will assess a partial surrender transaction charge of  percent of the amount withdrawn not to exceed  the maximum partial surrender that you may make at any time is equal to the accumulation value less any outstanding policy loan and accrued interest any applicable surrender charge and three months of monthly charges the minimum partial surrender that you may make is  we will not process a partial surrender that would cause your policy to be disqualified as life insurance under the code we reserve the right to defer the payment of any amount from the guaranteed interest account upon surrender or partial surrender for up to six months  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th you may also borrow an amount up to your accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and three months of monthly charges as a policy loan a policy loan may have tax consequences see federal tax status on page  what are some of the risks of the policy your accumulation value under the policy to the extent invested in the subaccounts of the account has no guaranteed minimum value therefore you bear the risk that any adverse investment performance in the subaccounts may reduce your accumulation value under the policy you are also subject to the risk that the investment performance of the subaccounts you select may be less favorable than that of other subaccounts and in order to keep the policy in force you may be required to pay more premiums than originally planned the policy also offers you the opportunity to have your accumulation value increase more rapidly than it would under comparable fixed life insurance by virtue of favorable investment performance the death benefit may also increase and decrease with investment experience there is the risk that the policy may terminate as described in the termination and reinstatement sections of this prospectus termination will only occur when the accumulation value under the policy less the sum of any outstanding policy loans and unpaid policy loan interest is insufficient to cover the monthly charges and the subsequent grace period expires without sufficient payment being made you may reinstate a terminated policy subject to certain conditions policy loans may increase the risk that the policy will terminate if a policy terminates with an outstanding policy loan there may be significant adverse tax consequences to the owner policy loans may also have a negative effect on a policys accumulation value and may reduce the death benefit see policy premiums on page  you may elect the overloan protection agreement to prevent policy termination in certain circumstances the tax treatment of the overloan protection agreement is uncertain and it is not clear whether the overloan protection agreement will be effective to prevent taxation of any outstanding loan balance as a distribution in those situations where overloan protection takes effect anyone contemplating the purchase of the policy with the overloan protection agreement should consult a tax adviser surrendering your policy or taking partial surrenders may have significant tax consequences if you surrender your policy you may be assessed a surrender charge a partial surrender will be subject to a transaction charge equal to the lesser of  or  percent of the amount of the partial surrender a partial surrender will reduce the accumulation value and will reduce the death benefit and increase the risk of termination see federal tax status on page  there is risk that the policy may not qualify as life insurance for federal tax purposes we believe that a policy issued on the basis of a standard underwriting class should so qualify however it is not clear whether a policy issued on a substandard basis would qualify failure to qualify would mean that the death proceeds would be included in the beneficiarys gross income for federal income tax purposes and that the accumulation value is constructively received before it is actually received the policy may be unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle due to the costs of insurance and expenses charged furthermore subaccount values could decline depending upon changes in the underlying funds depending upon the timing of withdrawals the policy owner could lose all or part of their premium payments there is also a risk that a policy qualifying as life insurance will be treated as a modified endowment contract mec a mec is treated as life insurance with respect to the tax treatment of death  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th proceeds and the taxfree inside buildup of yearly accumulation value increases however any amounts you receive such as loans or amounts received from partial or total surrender of the policy are includable in gross income on an incomefirst basis with certain exceptions the tax treatment includes a ten percent additional income tax imposed on the portion of any distribution that is included in income see federal tax status on page  portfolio risks a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each portfolio may be found in each portfolios

account accumulation value by multiplying the current number of subaccount units for each subaccount in which you are invested by the current subaccount unit value for that subaccount and adding those

receive your premium at our home office once determined the number of units credited to your policy will not be affected by changes in subaccount unit values however the number of units in a

policy loans transfers and partial surrenders from the subaccount the number of units in a subaccount will decrease to zero if the policy is surrendered or terminated the unit value of a subaccount will be determined on each valuation date the amount of any increase or decrease will depend on the net investment experience of the subaccount the value of a unit for each subaccount was originally set at  on the first valuation date for any subsequent valuation date its value is equal to its value on the preceding valuation date multiplied by the net investment factor for that subaccount for the valuation period ending on the subsequent valuation date the net investment factor is a measure of the net investment experience of a subaccount the net investment factor for a valuation period is the gross investment rate for such valuation period plus any unit value credit under the policy we determine periodically whether unit value credits apply unit value credits are not guaranteed for any period we apply a unit value credit we will apply the credit each day when we calculate the unit value for the subaccount the gross investment rate is equal to  the net asset value per share of a fund share held in the subaccount of the account determined at the end of the current valuation period plus  the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distributions by the fund if the exdividend date occurs during the current valuation period with the sum divided by  the net asset value per share of that fund share held in the subaccount determined at the end of the preceding valuation period the table below describes the annual unit value credit that we may in our sole discretion apply to each subaccount of the account the annual unit value credit is expressed as a percentage of average annual portfolio assets held by the subaccount the amount of the unit value credit we may apply varies among subaccounts with some subaccounts receiving larger unit value credits than other subaccounts some subaccounts are not eligible for a unit value credit the table below also describes the total annual portfolio operating expenses for each portfolio in which the corresponding subaccount invests for the fiscal year ended december   and provides a net portfolio operating expenses figure for each portfolio the net portfolio operating expenses figure is a hypothetical figure

the cvat before the policy is issued once the policy is issued you may not change to a different test the death benefit will vary depending on which test is used the gpt has two components a premium limit component and a corridor component the premium limit restricts the amount of premium that can be paid into the policy the corridor requires that the death benefit be at least a certain percentage varying each year by age of the insured of the accumulation value the cvat does not have a premium limit but does have a corridor that requires that the death benefit be at least a certain percentage varying based on the age and gender class of the insured of the accumulation value the corridor under the cvat is different than the corridor under the gpt specifically the cvat corridor requires more death benefit in relation to accumulation value than is required by the gpt corridor therefore for a policy in the corridor with no additional agreements as your accumulation value increases your death benefit will increase more rapidly under cvat than it would under gpt your policy will be issued using the gpt unless you choose otherwise in deciding whether or not to choose the cvat you should consider that the cvat generally permits more premiums to be contributed to a policy but may require the policy to have a higher death benefit which may increase certain charges under

amount of the loan account we assess a onetime charge when the agreement is exercised other matters federal tax status introduction the discussion of federal taxes is general in nature and is not intended as tax advice each person concerned should consult a tax adviser this discussion is based on our understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current income tax laws or the current interpretations of the internal revenue service the irs we have not considered any applicable state or other tax laws taxation of minnesota life and the individual variable universal life account we are taxed as a life insurance company under the code the operations of the account form a part of and are taxed with our other business activities currently we pay no federal income tax on income dividends received by the account or on capital gains arising from the accounts activities the account is not taxed as a regulated investment company under the code and it does not anticipate any change in that tax status at the present time we make no charge to the account for any federal state or local taxes that we incur that may be attributable to such account or to the policies we however reserve the right in the future to make a charge for any such tax or other economic burden resulting from the application of the tax laws that we determine to be properly attributable to the account or the policies  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in calculating our corporate income tax liability we derive certain corporate income tax benefits associated with the investment of company assets including separate account assets that are treated as company assets under applicable income tax law these benefits which reduce our overall corporate income tax liability may include dividends received deductions and foreign tax credits which can be material we do not pass these benefits through to the separate accounts principally because i the majority of the benefits results from the dividends received deduction which involves no reduction in the dollar amount of dividends that the separate account receives and ii under applicable income tax law for purposes of both the dividends received deductions and the foreign tax credits contract owners are not the owners of the assets generating those benefits tax status of the policy in order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a policy must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in the code guidance as to how these requirements are to be applied is limited nevertheless we believe that a policy issued on a standard rate class basis other than those with a cash extra charge should satisfy the applicable requirements there is less guidance however with respect to policies issued on a substandard basis or with a cash extra charge and it is not clear whether such policies will in all cases satisfy the applicable requirements if a policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes that policy would not provide most of the tax advantages normally provided by a life insurance contract if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy the applicable requirements we may take appropriate steps to bring the policy into compliance with such requirements and we reserve the right to restrict policy transactions in order to do so in some circumstances owners of variable life insurance contracts who retain excessive control over the investment of underlying variable account assets may be treated as the owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those assets although published guidance in this area does not address certain aspects of the policies we believe that the owner of a policy should not be treated as the owner of the assets held in the account which is the variable account underlying the policy we reserve the right to modify the policies to bring them into conformity with applicable standards should such modification be necessary to prevent owners of the policies from being treated as the owners of the assets held in the account in addition the code requires that the investments of the account be adequately diversified in order to treat the policy as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes we intend that the account through the funds and the portfolios will satisfy these diversification requirements the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes tax treatment of policy benefits general we believe that the death benefit under a policy should generally be excludible from the gross income of the beneficiary federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each policy owner or beneficiary a tax adviser should be consulted on these consequences generally the policy owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the policy accumulation value until there is a distribution when distributions from a policy occur or when loans are taken out from or secured by a policy the tax consequences depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment contract  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th modified endowment contracts under the internal revenue code certain life insurance contracts are classified as mecs with less favorable income tax treatment than other life insurance contracts due to the policys flexibility with respect to premium payments and benefits each policys circumstances will determine whether the policy is a mec in general however a policy will be classified as a mec if the amount of premiums paid into the policy causes the policy to fail the pay test a policy will fail the pay test if at any time in the first seven policy years the amount paid into the policy exceeds the sum of the level premiums that would have been paid at that point under a policy that provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual payments if there is a reduction in the benefits under the policy during the first seven policy years for example as a result of a partial surrender the pay test will have to be reapplied as if the policy had originally been issued at the reduced face amount if there is a material change in the policys benefits or other terms even after the first seven policy years the policy may have to be retested as if it were a newly issued policy a material change can occur for example when there is an increase in the death benefit which is due to the payment of an unnecessary premium unnecessary premiums are premiums paid into the policy which are not needed in order to provide a death benefit equal to the lowest death benefit that was payable in the first seven policy years to prevent your policy from becoming a mec it may be necessary to limit premium payments or to limit reductions in benefits a current or prospective policy owner should consult with a competent adviser to determine whether a policy transaction will cause the policy to be classified as a mec distributions other than death benefits from modified endowment contracts policies classified as mecs are subject to the following tax rules  all distributions other than death benefits including distributions upon surrender and withdrawals from a mec will be treated first as distributions of gain taxable as ordinary income and as taxfree recovery of the policy owners investment in the policy only after all gain has been distributed  loans taken from or secured by a policy classified as a mec are treated as distributions and taxed accordingly  a  percent additional income tax is imposed on the amount subject to tax except where the distribution or loan is made when the policy owner has attained age   or is disabled or where the distribution is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary or designated beneficiary if a policy becomes a mec distributions that occur during the contract year will be taxed as distributions from a mec in addition distributions from a policy within two years before it becomes a mec will be taxed in this manner this means that a distribution made from a policy that is not a mec could later become taxable as a distribution from a mec distributions other than death benefits from policies that are not modified endowment contracts distributions other than death benefits from a policy that is not classified as a mec are generally treated first as a recovery of the policy owners investment in the policy and only after the recovery of all investment in the policy as taxable income however certain distributions which must be made in order to enable the policy to continue to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes if policy benefits are reduced during the first  policy years may be treated in whole or in part as ordinary income subject to tax  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th loans from or secured by a policy that is not a mec are generally not treated as distributions however the tax consequences associated with preferred loans are less clear and a tax adviser should be consulted about such loans finally the  percent additional income tax does not apply to distributions or loans from or secured by a policy that is not a mec settlement options even if the death benefit under the policy is excludible from income payments under settlement options may not be excludible in full this is because earnings on the death benefit after the insureds death are taxable and payments under the settlement options generally include such earnings you should consult a tax adviser as to the tax treatment of payments under the settlement options multiple policies under the code all mecs issued by us or an affiliated company to the same policy owner during any calendar year will be treated as one mec for purposes of determining the amount includable in gross income under section e of the code additional rules may be promulgated under this provision to prevent avoidance of its effects through serial contracts or otherwise for further information on current aggregation rules under this provision see your own tax adviser investment in the policy your investment in the policy is generally your aggregate premiums when a distribution is taken from the policy your investment in the policy is reduced by the amount of the distribution that is tax free policy loans in general interest on a policy loan will not be deductible if a policy loan is outstanding when a policy is canceled or terminated the amount of the outstanding indebtedness will be added to the amount distributed and will be taxed accordingly before taking out a policy loan you should consult a tax adviser as to the tax consequences overloan protection agreement anyone contemplating the purchase of the policy with the overloan protection agreement should be aware that the tax consequences of the overloan protection agreement have not been ruled on by the irs or the courts and it is possible that the irs could assert that the outstanding loan balance should be treated as a taxable distribution when the overloan protection agreement is exercised you should consult a tax adviser as to the tax risks associated with the overloan protection agreement withholding to the extent policy distributions are taxable they are generally subject to income tax withholding recipients can generally elect however not to have tax withheld from distributions other taxes the transfer of the policy or the designation of a beneficiary may have federal state andor local transfer and inheritance tax consequences including the imposition of gift estate and generationskipping transfer taxes for example the transfer of the policy to or the designation as beneficiary of or the payment of proceeds to a person who is assigned to a generation which is two or more generations below the generation of the policy owner may have generationskipping transfer tax considerations under section  of the code the individual situation of each policy owner or beneficiary will determine the extent if any to which federal state and local transfer taxes may be imposed that situation will also determine how ownership or receipt of policy proceeds will be treated for purposes of federal state and local estate inheritance generationskipping transfer and other taxes  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th continuation of policy beyond age  while we intend for the policy to remain in force through the insureds age  the tax consequences associated with a policy remaining in force after the insureds th birthday are unclear you should consult a tax adviser in all these circumstances other transactions changing the policy owner may have tax consequences pursuant to section a of the code exchanging this policy for another involving the same insureds should have no federal income tax consequences if there is no debt and no cash or other property is received the new policy would have to satisfy the pay test from the date of the exchange to avoid characterization as a mec an exchange of a life insurance contract for a new life insurance contract may however result in a loss of grandfathering status for statutory changes made after the old policy was issued business uses of policy the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans splitdollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if you are contemplating the use of such policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should be sure to consult a tax adviser regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement moreover in recent years congress has adopted new rules relating to corporate owned life insurance the pension protection act of  added a new section to the code that denies the taxfree treatment of death benefits payable under an employerowned life insurance contract unless certain notice and consent requirements are met and either  certain rules relating to the insured employees status are satisfied or  certain rules relating to the payment of the amount received under the contract to or for the benefit of certain beneficiaries or successors of the insured employee are satisfied the new rules apply to life insurance contracts owned by corporations including s corporations individual sole proprietors estates and trusts and partnerships that are engaged in a trade or business any business contemplating the purchase of a policy on the life of an employee should consult with its legal and tax advisers regarding the applicability of the new legislation to the proposed purchase if a policy is owned or held by a corporation trust or other nonnatural person this could jeopardize some or all of such entitys interest deduction under code section  even where such entitys indebtedness is in no way connected to the policy in addition under section f if a business other than a sole proprietorship is directly or indirectly a beneficiary of a policy this policy could be treated as held by the business for purposes of the section f entityholder rules therefore it would be advisable to consult with a qualified tax adviser before any nonnatural person is made an owner or holder of a policy or before a business other than a sole proprietorship is made a beneficiary of a policy splitdollar arrangements a tax adviser should be consulted with respect to the  splitdollar regulations if you have purchased or are considering the purchase of a policy for a splitdollar insurance plan any business contemplating the purchase of a new life insurance contract or a change in an existing contract should consult a tax adviser additionally the sarbanesoxley act of  the act prohibits with limited exceptions publiclytraded companies including nonus companies that have securities listed on exchanges in the united states from extending directly or through a subsidiary many types of personal loans to their directors or executive officers it is possible that this prohibition may be interpreted as applying to splitdollar life insurance policies for directors and executive officers of such companies since such insurance arguably can be viewed as involving a loan from the employer for at least some purposes  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th although the prohibition on loans is generally effective as of the acts effective date of july   there is an exception for loans outstanding as of the date of enactment so long as there is no material modification to the loan terms and the loan is not renewed after july   any affected business contemplating the payment of a premium on an existing policy or the purchase of a new policy in connection with a splitdollar life insurance arrangement should consult legal counsel alternative minimum tax there may also be an indirect tax upon the income in the policy or the proceeds of a policy under the federal corporate alternative minimum tax if the policy owner is subject to that tax estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes the transfer of the policy or designation of a beneficiary may have federal state andor local transfer and inheritance tax consequences including the imposition of gift estate and generationskipping transfer taxes for example when the insured dies the death proceeds will generally be includable in the policy owners estate for purposes of federal estate tax if the insured owned the policy if the policy owner was not the insured the fair market value of the policy would be included in the policy owners estate upon the policy owners death the policy would not be includable in the insureds estate if the insured neither retained incidents of ownership at death nor had given up ownership within three years before death moreover under certain circumstances the code may impose a generation skipping transfer tax when all or part of a life insurance policy is transferred to or a death benefit is paid to an individual two or more generations younger than the policy owner regulations issued under the code may require us to deduct the tax from your policy or from any applicable payment and pay it directly to the irs qualified tax advisers should be consulted concerning the estate and gift tax consequences of policy ownership and distributions under federal state and local law the individual situation of each owner or beneficiary will determine the extent if any to which federal state and local transfer and inheritance taxes may be imposed and how ownership or receipt of policy proceeds will be treated for purposes of federal state and local estate inheritance generationskipping and other taxes economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  egtrra repeals the federal estate tax and replaces it with a carryover basis income tax regime effective for estates of decedents dying after december   egtrra also repeals the generationskipping transfer tax but not the gift tax for transfers made after december   egtrra contains a sunset provision which essentially returns the federal estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes to their preegtrra form beginning in  congress may or may not enact permanent repeal between now and then during the period prior to  egtrra provides for periodic decreases in the maximum estate tax rate coupled with periodic increases in the estate tax exemption the complexity of egtrra along with uncertainty as to how it might be modified in coming years underscores the importance of seeking guidance from a qualified adviser to help ensure that your estate plan adequately addresses your needs and that of your beneficiaries under all possible scenarios it should be understood that the foregoing description of the federal income gift and estate tax consequences under the policies is not exhaustive and that special rules are provided with respect to situations not discussed statutory changes in the code with varying effective dates and regulations adopted thereunder may also alter the tax consequences of specific

that result in an increase in the net amount at risk under the policy proof of insurability and classification for cost of insurance charges are determined by our underwriting rules and procedures

for policies issued as a result of conversion from existing policies for policies issued as part of a small group case or for face amount increases pursuant to an additional benefit agreement the basis for the mortality charges guaranteed in the policies are determined by the gender tobacco habits and age of each insured and are based on the  cso composite gender distinct age nearest birthday mortality tables in instances where the insurance is required to be provided on a unisex basis the guaranteed mortality charges are based on the  cso unisex table b settlement options the proceeds of

pay a specified amount until the proceeds and interest thereto are fully paid if you request a settlement option you will be asked to sign an agreement covering the settlement option which will state the terms and conditions of the payments unless you specify otherwise the beneficiary may select a settlement option after the insureds death the minimum rate of interest we will credit under any settlement option is a  percent annual rate of interest we may in our sole discretion credit higher rates of interest on monies held by us in our general account which are to be paid under a settlement option illustrations to illustrate the operation of the policy under certain assumptions we have prepared the following tables along with explanatory text that may be of assistance the following tables illustrate how the accumulation value cash surrender value and death benefit of a policy change with the investment experience of the subaccounts of the account the tables show how the accumulation value cash surrender value and death benefit of a policy to an insured of a given age and at a given premium would vary over time if the investment return on the assets held in each subaccount of the account were a uniform gross aftertax rate of  percent and  percent the actual cash values and death benefits would be different from those shown if the returns averaged  percent and  percent but fluctuated over the life of the policy the tables illustrate a policy issued to an insured male age  in the standard nontobacco risk class with a level death benefit option the tables assume an initial face amount of  and an annual planned premium payment of  the tables also assume that the guideline premium test for definition of life insurance has been elected the tables reflect both guaranteed maximum and current charges for all charges under the policy except charges for  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th partial surrenders transfers and any optional agreements the tables assume that there have been no allocations made to the guaranteed interest account guaranteed maximum cost of insurance charges will vary by age gender and risk class we use the male female and unisex composite  commissions standard ordinary mortality table  cso as appropriate the unisex tables are used in circumstances where legal considerations require the elimination of genderbase distinctions in the calculation of mortality costs our maximum cost of insurance charges are based on an assumption of the mortality rates reflected in  cso tables in many cases we intend to impose cost of insurance charges which are lower than the maximum charges described above in addition to the factors governing maximum cost of insurance charges actual charges will vary depending on the risk category of the insured current cost of insurance charges reflect our current practices with respect to mortality charges for this class of policies similarly we impose a current monthly policy charge which is less than the guaranteed contractual charge we expect that these current charges will compensate us for the actual costs of administration if the actual costs change this charge may increase or decrease as necessary although it may not exceed the maximum stated in the policy the amounts shown for the hypothetical accumulation value and death benefit as of each policy year reflect the fact that the net investment return on the assets held in the subaccounts is lower than the gross aftertax return this is because a daily investment management fee assessed against the net assets of the portfolio is deducted from the gross return the investment management fee illustrated is  percent and represents the arithmetic average of the annual fee charged for all portfolios available under the policy the illustrations also reflect a deduction for those fund costs and expenses borne by the funds and for distribution b fees fund expenses illustrated are  percent representing the arithmetic average of the  expense ratios of the portfolios available under the policy certain expenses for certain portfolios of the funds were waived or reduced however the averages used in these illustrations do not reflect the waivers or reductions the b fee illustrated is  percent and represents the arithmetic average of those fees charged for all portfolios that assess a b fee lastly the net return is increased by any unit value credit that we are currently providing the unit value credit illustrated is  percent and represents the arithmetic average of the unit value credit for all portfolios available under the policy for the maximum contractual charges illustration no unit value credit is assumed so the net annual rates of return shown are  and  percent therefore gross annual rates of return of  and  percent correspond to approximate net annual rates of return of  and  percent on the current charges illustration the illustration reflects the fact that no charges for federal state or local income taxes are currently made against the account if such a charge is made in the future it will take a higher gross rate of return to produce aftertax returns of  and  percent than it does now if a particular policy would be subject to different levels of charges the accumulation values cash surrender values and death benefits would vary from those shown in the tables the accumulation values cash surrender values and death benefits would also vary if premiums were paid in other amounts or at other than annual intervals or accumulation values were allocated differently among individual subaccounts with varying rates of return in addition the  pnst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st accumulation values cash surrender values and death benefits would also vary between tables depending upon whether the level option increasing option or sum of premiums option death benefit is illustrated upon request we will furnish a personalized illustration based upon a proposed insureds age gender and risk classification and on the face amount premium death benefit option and gross annual rate of return requested those illustrations may be materially different from the sample illustration included in this statement depending upon the proposed insureds actual situation for example illustrations for females tobacco users or individuals who are rated substandard will

vul is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value in a vul the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a vul policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums contents  regulation of vul providers  uses  contract features  premium flexibility  maximum premiums  investment choices  tax advantages  risks of variable universal life  general uses of variable universal life  criticisms of variable universal life  references  external links regulation of vul providersedit because the separate accounts are securities the representative providing a vul must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates and because they are life insurance policies vuls may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an insurer this dual regulation helps protect consumers who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating sro self regulatory organization or provincial securities commission united states vuls may only be sold in the united states by representatives who have a producers life insurance license in the states in which he or she operates the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the states as an

may only be sold in canada by life insurancelicensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province typically a provincial insurance act and as vuls are life insurance policies providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations insurance companies act established by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi since vuls are presently not considered to be securities in canada they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products in canada there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal lifemkj usesedit variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the united states internal revenue code the cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force the tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy see the tax benefits section for more in one theory of life insurance needs based analysis life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against the policy contract featuresedit by allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when variable universal life policies first became available in  contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits in order to curb this practice but still encourage life insurance purchase the irs developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit maximum premiumsedit the standard set was twofold to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit if the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a mec a mec still receives tax free investment returns and a tax free death benefit but withdrawals of cash value in a mec are on a lifo basis where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income if the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded in order to avoid this contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet irs guidelines the maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit the percentage ranges from  or so for young insured persons declining to  for those reaching age  the maximum premiums are set by the irs guidelines such that the premiums paid within a sevenyear period after a qualifying event such as purchase or death benefit increase grown at a  rate and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract would endow the policy at age  ie the cash value would equal the death benefit more specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a sevenyear period the entire maximum premium greater than the  year premium can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased if the  year level guideline premium is exceeded then the policy becomes a mec to add more confusion the sevenyear mec premium level cannot be paid in a vul every year for  years and still avoid mec status the mec premium level can only be paid in practice for about  years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non mec status is desired there is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force this premium carries different names from different insurers one calling it the guideline maximum premium this is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy investment choicesedit the number and type of choices available varies from company to company and from policy to policy the current generation of vul policies have a wide variety of subaccounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into these newer policies often offer  or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds and are so named because they are kept separate from the general account of the life insurance company they are similar to mutual funds but have different regulatory requirements tax advantagesedit tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force fifo withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract income tax free policy loans from policies that are not modified endowment contracts income tax free death benefits may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets  would desire to use a vul over any other accumulation strategy for someone in a  tax bracket federal  state the investment return on the separate accounts may average  and at say age  the policys death benefit would have an internal rate of return of  in order to get a  rate of return in an ordinary taxable account in a  tax bracket one must earn  an alternative for this in the  tax bracket would be to consider using variable annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract other alternatives for those in the  tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider sep iras company ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist these numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company and it is assumed that the vul is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium the cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans which would be paid off on death by the death benefit risks of variable universal lifeedit cost of insurance  the cost of insurance for vuls is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages the risk of mortality increases increasing the cost of insurance if not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings if this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance or very expensive insurance cash outlay  the cash needed to effectively use a vul is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies if a policy does not have the right amount of funding it may lapse investment risk  because the sub accounts in the vul may be invested in stocks and bonds the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company complexity  the vul is a complex product and can easily be used or sold inappropriately because of this proper funding investing and planning are usually required in order for the vul to work as expected general uses of variable universal lifeedit these are the features typically marketed by insurance companies however the vul in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed each of these features can be achieved through other means financial protection  as with all life insurance programs vuls can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death tax advantages  because of its taxdeferred feature the vul may offer an attractive tax advantage especially to those in higher tax brackets to attain them the policy must be highly funded though still nonmec for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance these tax advantages can be used for either education planning  the cash value of a vul can be used to help fund childrens education as long as the policy is started very early also putting money into a vul can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating efc expected family contribution retirement planning  because of its taxfree policy loan feature the vul can also be used as taxadvantaged income source in retirement assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract again the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work estate planning  those with a large estate a filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding  effective for decedents dying on or after january   can sometimes use a vul as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ilit criticisms of variable universal lifeedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january  learn how and when to remove this template message some general criticisms potentially higher costs  vul policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance such as whole life and traditional universal life volatility of cash surrender values especially at late duration can cause a reverse dollar cost averaging effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk but it cannot be completely eliminated some older vul policies have limited subaccount choices this issue has been greatly corrected with the current generation of policies having  or more subaccounts that cover all the major asset classes with more than one subaccount manager policy administrative expenses and costs of insurance may increase at the companys whim subject to a contractual maximum vul is relatively complex compared to traditional whole life or term life some criticism is not about the product but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates generally  using current or assumed administrative expenses and current costs of insurance without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return creating a blue sky problem some regulators are criticized as well the financial industry regulatory authority finra does not allow insurance companies to illustrate vul policies using a stochastic projection commonly called a monte carlo simulation limiting

accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the

her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against

investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when variable universal life policies first became available in  contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits in order to curb this practice but still encourage life insurance purchase the irs developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit maximum premiumsedit the standard set was twofold to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit if the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a mec a mec still receives tax free investment returns and a tax free death benefit but withdrawals of cash value in a mec are on a lifo basis where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income if the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded in order to avoid this contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet irs guidelines the maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit the percentage ranges from  or so for young insured persons declining to  for those reaching age  the maximum premiums are set by the irs guidelines such that the premiums paid within a sevenyear period after a qualifying event such as purchase or death benefit increase grown at a  rate and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract would endow the policy at age  ie the cash value would equal the death benefit more specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in

insurance from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate december  learn how and when to remove this template message variable universal life insurance often shortened to vul is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value in a vul the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock andor bond markets the universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the internal revenue code for life insurance this flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an automatic premium loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a whole life premium variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy with most if not all vuls unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically  this is yet another key advantage of vul over whole life with a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid out thus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years however some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time if investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole life the combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a vul policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums contents  regulation of vul providers  uses  contract features  premium flexibility  maximum premiums  investment choices  tax advantages  risks of variable universal life  general uses of variable universal life  criticisms of variable universal life  references  external links regulation of vul providersedit because the separate accounts are securities the representative providing a vul must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates and because they are life insurance policies vuls may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an insurer this dual regulation helps protect consumers who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating sro self regulatory organization or provincial securities commission united states vuls may only be sold in the united states by representatives who have a producers life insurance license in the states in which he or she operates the insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the states as an insurer because the separate accounts are securities the representative must be working through a brokerdealer registered with the united states sro the financial industry regulatory authority finra and himself be registered with finra finra has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or brokerdealer the fact of a representatives securities registration will show on his state insurance license as variable as in qualified for life and variable products the exact wording could vary from state to state canada vuls as life insurance policies may only be sold in canada by life insurancelicensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province typically a provincial insurance act and as vuls are life insurance policies providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations insurance companies act established by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi since vuls are presently not considered to be securities in canada they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products in canada there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal lifemkj usesedit variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the united states internal revenue code the cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force the tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy see the tax benefits section for more in one theory of life insurance needs based analysis life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents in one form of variable universal life insurance the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer therefore the greater the cash value accumulation the lesser the net amount at risk and the less insurance that is purchased another use of variable universal life insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into vul policies under the gift tax exemption very often persons in the united states with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed often this is done within a vul policy because this allows a tax deferral for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational ira or  plan provides for permanent life insurance and can usually be accessed taxfree by borrowing against the policy contract featuresedit by allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return if the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing ceasing to exist as a valid policy to avoid this many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid premium flexibilityedit vul policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit the minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer to maintain a death benefit guarantee that specified premium level must be paid every month to keep the policy in force typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that months cost of insurance the maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance internal revenue code section  sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid both in a given year and over certain periods of time for a given death benefit the most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value in the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component and was entirely cash value if it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter pure investment returns and no insurance cost in fact when variable universal life policies first became available in  contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits in order to curb this practice but still encourage life insurance purchase the irs developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit maximum premiumsedit the standard set was twofold to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit if the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a mec a mec still receives tax free investment returns and a tax free death benefit but withdrawals of cash value in a mec are on a lifo basis where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income if the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded in order to avoid this contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet irs guidelines the maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit the percentage ranges from  or so for young insured persons declining to  for those reaching age  the maximum premiums are set by the irs guidelines such that the premiums paid within a sevenyear period after a qualifying event such as purchase or death benefit increase grown at a  rate and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract would endow the policy at age  ie the cash value would equal the death benefit more specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a sevenyear period the entire maximum premium greater than the  year premium can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased if the  year level guideline premium is exceeded then the policy becomes a mec to add more confusion the sevenyear mec premium level cannot be paid in a vul every year for  years and still avoid mec status the mec premium level can only be paid in practice for about  years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non mec status is desired there is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force this premium carries different names from different insurers one calling it the guideline maximum premium this is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy investment choicesedit the number and type of choices available varies from company to company and from policy to policy the current generation of vul policies have a wide variety of subaccounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into these newer policies often offer  or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds and are so named because they are kept separate from the general account of the life insurance company they are similar to mutual funds but have different regulatory requirements tax advantagesedit tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force fifo withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract income tax free policy loans from policies that are not modified endowment contracts income tax free death benefits may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets  would desire to use a vul over any other accumulation strategy for someone in a  tax bracket federal  state the investment return on the separate accounts may average  and at say age  the policys death benefit would have an internal rate of return of  in order to get a  rate of return in an ordinary taxable account in a  tax bracket one must earn  an alternative for this in the  tax bracket would be to consider using variable annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract other alternatives for those in the  tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider sep iras company ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist these numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company and it is assumed that the vul is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium the cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans which would be paid off on death by the death benefit risks of variable universal lifeedit cost of insurance  the cost of insurance for vuls is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages the risk of mortality increases increasing the cost of insurance if not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings if this continues long term the savings will be depleted and
