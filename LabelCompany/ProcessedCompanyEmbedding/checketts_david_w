places company b welding title welder company college sports tv title cochairman david wayne checkettss experience title welder company b welding job details title cochairman company college sports tv job details college sports by charlie or collegecharlieis a hobby  we have been a prep school athletics director for  years  we believe that college athletics particularly football at the six power conferences have abandoned the studentathlete concept for the big bucks  the education of the athlete is totally secondary to the commercial enterprise of big time college athletics programs   we maintain the web site to let off some steam and as a way to interact with folks it has been fun to receive comments from readers  some agree with our commentary and some get downright angry at some of what we publish  see archives   it is also fun to try and mimic the big guys who have college sites that are read each day by millions our purpose is to get our readers to at least think about some of the ideas we put forth  basically we have found that since we started in  that the average college sports fan could care less about academic integrity  they dont care if their favorite college athletes ever go to class or obtain a degree  they dont care if the star wide receiver was in jail the night before the big game  they just love the fun and pageantry of college football  and most are willing to spend lots of dollars to follow their team we believe that the athletic philosophy of the ivy league is the example that should be followed by the entire ncaa  we also love the  ncaa members that make up the iaa football division  the big bucks have not corrupted them yet additional professional information on david wayne checketts see david wayne checkettss linkedin profile david
