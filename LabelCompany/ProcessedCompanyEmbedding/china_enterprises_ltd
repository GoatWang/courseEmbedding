was originally scheduled for release in july  but was delayed several times before the january  release it was the first in a series of gerry anderson vehicles aimed at collectors subsequently other versions of the eagle appeared the model was based on the warp garage kit eagle transporter product enterprise limited to  units th january  £ eagle transporter aoshima february   yen rescue eagle

boosterlab eagle as above top boosters from metamorph infernal machine laser tank moonbuggy november  £ vip eagle november  £ die cast metal model  x  x  cm painted white passenger module is detachable secured with two spring latches detailing is based closely on the first  eagle model realistically detailed with framework engine and leg piping and surface details there are small red and orange markings on the framework engines and side pods similar to those seen at the end of year  transporter rescue and the limited edition silver chrome eagles have identical boxes presentation box is  x  x cm  including flap the model is mounted in clear plastic on a red cardboard base decorated like a launch pad there is a folded cm long card backdrop with a painting of moonbase alpha also seen on the box sides and rear the box artwork is a little cartoonish especially the eagles on the front and rear they have obviously distorted nose cones in contrast to the accurate model itself the flap has a large space  logo with a gerry anderson century inspired roundel design the freighter and cargo boxes are almost identical with a description under the logo other sides of the box still say eagle transporter the rear of the box has text in a main mission big screen roberto baldassaris artwork product enterprise ltd is proud to present a highly detailed replica of the eagle transporter as a metal diecast collectors edition with detachable central pod this stunning model captures the essence of this classic spacecraft from space  art for the rear of the box the models were also available from aoshima a japanese model company the aoshima boxes are similar to the old imai eagle model kit art although it is actually a photo of the model unlike the product enterprise boxes the transporter and rescue eagles have different boxes although to the same design the small photos on the side are the same as the imai too the english caption says  scale diecast model high quality details the underside of the boxes have pictures of the model in plan and side profiles inside the contents model launch pad base and moonbase card backdrop are identical it is a little more expensive than the uk version us vs us the most impressive eagle model to date the model is a third larger than the dinky eagle but without the obvious plastic framework green and blue paint or the major simplifications to the design it is similar in size to the airfixmpc eagle plastic construction kit but without the need to rebuild it with accurising kits and no modelmaking expertise is required the legs do not have spring suspension but are authentically detailed the pod release is practical but subtle variations the chrome and gold plated eagles were obviously aimed at collectors rather than fans the gold eagle came in a box with plush red lining looking rather like a coffin the rescuemedical eagle red stripes are too thin the stripes should be the same width as the space between them the freighter pod has a slightly different mechanism and is the only one with an instruction leaflet ungrammatically titled instructions of detach or attach the freighter pod oddly the freighter is painted inaccurately in two different shades of gray the laboratory eagle was released individually and as part of a gift set announced for july  but delayed until november  it is very accurate apart from the placement of the moonbase alpha decals the vip eagle is a representation of simmondss eagle from breakaway seen very briefly this was a limited edition of  due august  released november
