third of the bullfrog deposit from which barrick bullfrog inc recovered  ounces averaging  gt from the ms pit  million ounces averaging  gt from the northern bullfrog pit and  ounces at  gt from their underground mine barrick terminated mining in late  and milling in early  during which times gold prices averaged less than  per ounce   bfgc is the only entity since  to examine the barrick electronic and paper data bases which include  miles of drilling in  holes and more than  pounds of documents bfgc recently estimated mineral inventories remaining around the barrick mines at  ounces averaging  gt based on crosssectional methods and a nominal cutoff grade of  gt these average and cutoff grades are higher than most heap leach projects proposed and operating in the usa the estimates are also supported by closespaced drill holes upon which barrick recovered a total of  million ounces from their proven and probable ore reserve estimates as a result these estimates could be readily and inexpensively upgraded in compliance with us and canadian estimation standards bfgc has also identified significant additional mineralization and defined several exploration targets that could further enhance the project and add shareholder value although barrick’s buildings and equipment have been removed project infrastructure and attributes include suitable access roads and pit ramps main powerline and substation a paved state highway that crosses the property more water rights than foreseeably needed and a town less than  miles away that hosts a population of  with associated amenities and services   pilot heap leach tests performed by barrick in  on  tons containing  gt and crushed to inch recovered  of the gold in only  days of leaching cyanide and lime consumptions were less than  poundton and nil respectively finer crushed material yielded gold recoveries up to  in  st joe column leached a ton composite of minus inch material to simulate leaching large runofmine rom sizes and remarkably recovered  in only  days of leaching this would allow a rom cutoff grade of  gt or less in this regard barrick did not have low cost heap leaching facilities and used cutoff grades of  gt for pit ore and  gt for underground ore   the company has a market capitalization per ounce of mineralization of less than  compared to  to  for most companies having similar heap leach projects  the company recently reduced its debt from  million to  million   management david beling president and ceo is a professional mining engineer with  years of experience including engineering
