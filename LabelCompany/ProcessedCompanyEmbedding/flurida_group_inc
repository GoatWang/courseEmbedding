account payable   income tax liabilities and   unearned revenue   loan from the bank and   other payable our independent auditor has indicated that our customer concentration may raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing then the company may be required to cease or curtail its operations however due to the close relationship between the company and its supplier chuzhou fu da and zhong nan fu rui which is closely related and directly managed by shareholder and director jianfeng ding besides as of december   the cash and cash equivalent balance was   the management believes that the revenues will be generated and its cash flows will be maintained to cover its operational costs and the risk of going concern in long term is significantly low interest rate risk we do not have significant interest rate risk as our debt obligations ie notes payables to shareholders which can be converted to common stocks the annual interest rate of notes payable is  and the interest expense
