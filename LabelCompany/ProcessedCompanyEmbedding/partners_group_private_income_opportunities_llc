investment subsidiaries a whollyowned investment subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with another regulated fund or any affiliated fund because it would be a

transactions in lieu of the applicable regulated fund and that such whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the requested order as though the regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between such regulated fund and its respective whollyowned investment subsidiaries the board of the regulated fund would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in a coinvestment transaction and the board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment subsidiary in place of the regulated fund if a regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subsidiaries its board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment subsidiary  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund an adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions

diversification investment objectives policies and strategies  with respect to participation in a potential coinvestment transaction by a regulated fund the applicable adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation of each investment opportunity to the eligible directors the required majority of a regulated fund will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the regulated fund  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments  provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro

applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of an adviser or the principals to
