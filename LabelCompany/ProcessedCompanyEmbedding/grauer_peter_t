facebook linkedin google email print comment quote supports kws leadership content when peter grauer’s daughter was six she sweettalked him into taking horseback riding lessons in new york’s westchester county where the family lived grauer didn’t mind because it gave him a good opportunity to have some saturday morning bonding time with her at the corral grauer met a congenial man who also had a young girl taking lessons the two struck up a friendship as they waited through their daughters’ sessions “our daughters became inseparable and we were happy about that” grauer recalled during a speech at the  wharton leadership conference noting the other man had started a business that had just become successful when the pair met in  “one of us would bring the bagels and the other the coffee we would talk about business and sports and families the usual stuff” then one day when the girls were in their teens the other dad decided to go into politics and wanted to cast off his ceo job “it was christmas of  and he asked me even though i had never worked in the media to be his company’s ceo” said grauer of his saturday morning stable buddy michael bloomberg “i tell people that you never know where you will make your connection i was fortunate and i have had a wonderful time i run one of the most successful us companies and i owe it all to my daughter’s desire to ride horses” in truth grauer was qualified to take the job at global media company bloomberg lp having worked in highlevel executive positions for bank of america and donaldson lufkin  jenrette according to grauer leadership cannot be boiled down to one or two attributes and even if it could those attributes would necessarily seem a bit contradictory at bloomberg he noted when his executives go on one of their frequent retreats they always come to the conclusion that the best leaders are those who exemplify a line from walt whitman’s “song of myself” “do i contradict myself … i am large i contain multitudes” “instead of just being the best bigpicture thinker someone may be the best at that and also detail oriented” said grauer “they can give direction on little things and also encourage big ideas they can be loyal to our company and also put the customer first we call it the ‘and factor’ and at bloomberg we consider it the definition of leadership qualities” grauer does not rule out anyone becoming a leader based solely on his or her background in fact he said his early years would certainly not be inspiring on a resume at  he considered life to be a series of three things — sports girls and fun — “i was pretty good at the first and last not so much the middle one” he joked eventually grauer realized that he needed to change his focus he convinced his parents to send him to boarding school for a chance at a fresh start grauer enrolled at the hotchkiss school and went from being a “c” student to president of the student body and captain of the football team but before he achieved those honors school officials would only admit him if he repeated the th grade knowledgewharton high school “no one wants to repeat a grade in high school but i knew i had to do it” grauer noted adding that he was lucky to get the opportunity to change course he ended up going to the university of north carolina grauer is constantly awed by the harvard princeton and yale types bloomberg often hires he said but the large stateschool environment was what he needed he learned to negotiate big crowds and home in on what he wanted grauer graduated from unc in  and the harvard university graduate school of business program for management development in  “life is a lot of being in the moment saying ‘how am i going to get out of here” he said “god knows where my maturity eventually came from” induce and reflect it is important grauer noted for a leader to assert himself or herself but even more vital is to have a good streak of humility “when i started my career i had that wall street swagger i certainly thought i was the smartest guy in the room” he recalled “then in  a miraculous thing happened i had a deal that turned into a big fiasco “at that stage of my career i lost whatever i had in terms of a reputation for being a deal maker” grauer said “after it fell apart i took a hard look at my skills from that moment on my approach was that i would take on every challenge with humility i would never be too proud to ask for help at bloomberg we call that ‘constructive paranoia’ we are constantly preparing for someone smarter than us to take us on i love the idea that people at our company do not think they are as good as they really are” grauer’s talk at wharton was titled “the ‘and’ factor embracing contradictions to develop great leaders” one of his “and” criteria is that a leader should have the ability to both induce action and stand back and reflect for example while running microsoft bill gates would often travel to a remote place and take only some articles he had put off reading grauer noted gates’s only interruption would be that he would have someone bring out meals otherwise he would spend his time reading and jotting down ideas “some would lead to a new product or a project for his foundation others would be small and fleeting but each one would give him more perspective we need to take time to step back from the daytoday and be alone with our thoughts” according to grauer the ability to reflect is a key skill he tries to instill in executives during bloomberg retreats particularly in the case of younger employees who may not have learned to value it yet “i have asked them to spend time outside of work with a clear sheet of paper and make brutal selfassessments” he noted “they can choose to share them with me or not but most have it set a framework for them about their strengths and weaknesses going forward i believe that a career is a long reflection on selfimprovement” above all other qualities grauer said a leader must establish a sense of intimacy with employees and customers he or she must as best as possible learn something about every employee and relate to them on a personal level because a leader can never be sure what trait will make an employee a future leader his own first big interview brought that point home to him “the head of college recruiting at citibank took a chance on me at my first big job” he noted “i was woefully underqualified on that first day there were mbas from harvard wharton and columbia but someone took a chance on something i had said or done — something that maybe i didn’t know i could do well myself “when i address a group i try to look everyone in the eye and shake hands” grauer continued “i want them to know they are important to me at some moment in the future i am going to ask people to do something hard… they will walk over hot coals for a leader who they believe has their interests in mind” working without a playbook prior to joining bloomberg grauer was a managing partner at donaldson lufkin  jenrette from  he served as managing director and senior partner of csfb private equity until march  when he joined bloomberg fulltime grauer had been a member of the media and financial data company’s board since  and has served as its chairman since  cofounded in  by new york mayor bloomberg the media company which provides financial analytics and data through the eponymous bloomberg terminal has grown to more than  employees in  locations across the globe the privately held firm generated  billion in revenue in  up from  billion in  according to forbes during grauer’s tenure bloomberg completed acquisitions of businessweek and the bureau of national affairs last may the company purchased dublinbased software firm polarlake in an effort to launch a new data management service while speaking at wharton grauer recalled a trip to japan that he took soon after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in  he had business to do but realized that circumstances also made it an opportunity to show leadership through intimacy “i arrived at  am and narita airport in tokyo was deserted the roads were empty when we made our way to the office it was pretty scary” grauer noted “when we arrived at our offices the building was still shaking with aftershocks” but to grauer’s amazement nearly all of the employees were in the office working they came he noted because it was important to them to check in on colleagues and to feel a sense of normalcy “i stopped at every desk shook hands and told them how important they were to us” said grauer “i told them that as a company we would never leave japan there are a lot of moments in one’s career where there is no playbook but when you approach it with humanity the rest will work”

forecasts bloomberg lp is serious about increasing its footprint in india on monday the global financial news and data provider inaugurated its new swanky office in mumbai peter t grauer chairman spoke to varada bhat about why the indian market is important their investment plans here and the changing landscape of the news business edited excerpts india is one of the key emerging markets apart from brazil russia and china that bloomberg has identified for growth what are your plans for india across all your businesses we started here  years ago with small base and now for the first time in bloombergs history we have an indiaspecific fiveyear plan this business plan has five main elements one is news in which we intend to improve and expand our coverage across all asset classes that indian and global investors care about two equity markets where we are already the preferred weapon of choice we want to maintain our market leadership position in the cash and the derivatives equity market in india the third objective is to capture and grow our presence in the indian fixed income markets four we are aggressively entering the forex market in india which till now we never really tapped finally we want to focus sharply on providing systems for the indian domestic asset management community the message we want to send is bloomberg is a local product with a local service which is why we are growing our staff in our new office in mumbai we have increased the headcount to  our overall staff strength in india is  people how much is the contribution from indian markets compared with that in other emerging markets currently our india revenues are very modest but in the next five years we are optimistic about its growth what about investments we plan to invest here in terms of human capital and broaden our product portfolio we think the indian market holds a great growth opportunity and as the market evolves and develops more broadly similar to some of the developed markets around the world most of the bloomberg capabilities will be available here what we are very excited about is that we have listened to a lot of our customers and many of them like to be serviced locally by locals one decision we have made is to put in one of the most important departments our analytics desk for customers in mumbai so the indian customers will be able to talk directly to indian staff about the indian domestic market and all the markets they want to you have taken a  per cent stake in utv given it the bloomberg name and the content are you pleased with how the joint venture has shaped up we are happy with the progress we think the partnership has been very successful and will exceed our expectation in the past we have had very few of such relationships and this is largely because we have always chosen to go on our own as a  per cent shareholder but this is a market where we can’t do that we spent probably two years looking for the right partner ultimately we got engaged with the utv team do you plan to raise your stake  per cent as that is within permissible limit at present we have no such plans for bloomberg more than business the tv channel is a vehicle to build the brand we made a decision just over two years ago to restructure bloomberg television by getting out of local language programming we used to be in a position where we produced english french german spanish italian portuguese and japaneselanguage business television for bloomberg but we decided to move away from that model and focus on a model that will give us a global channel and much more leverage in producing the highest quality content and the best distribution how does businessweek fit into your portfolio businessweek bw covers a market which we essentially do not cover so well our ultimate aim is is to be the most influential news organisation in the world for the financial markets and the business community the bw acquisition is a logical extension for us to be able to achieve that we believe the bw acquisition will yield huge benefits for users of the bloomberg professional service for bloomberg news and for our television internet and other multimedia properties while bloomberg customers are primarily financial professionals bw is read by ceos cfos deal lawyers investment banks product managers and high government officials so bw will expand our audience considering you have huge plans in india do you plan to distribute your content and products in indian languages as well at present we are not looking at it as most of our subscribers here communicate in english basically in all the countries we operate in english is the most preferred medium only in japan  per cent of subscribers use the japanese service what do you think about the changing landscape of news business do you see web as potential threat yes as a result of that we have services and products that allow to access bloomberg service from any internet connected desk top and also through mobiles we have customised applications for blackberry ipad iphone androids and select nokia devices read more on peter t grauer  bloomberg lp  global financial

that the company should have reconsidered articles that deviated from its core of coverage of business news because they jeopardized the huge sales potential for its products in the chinese marketthe comments by the chairman peter t grauer represented the starkest acknowledgment yet by a senior bloomberg executive that the ambitions of the news division should be assessed in the context of the business operation which provides the bulk of the company’s revenue they also signaled which of those considerations might get priorityacknowledging the vast size of the chinese economy the world’s

bloomberg employees say is a reemphasis on financial news and skepticism from the business side about whether investigative journalism is worth the potential problems it could create for terminal

who had been a lead reporter on the xi family wealth article in  — left bloomberg news shortly after reports of the controversy were published in november he joined the new york times in januarysome current and former bloomberg journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity said they had hoped the controversy surrounding bloomberg’s china reporting would prompt the company to reaffirm its support for investigative efforts mr grauer’s comments were met with dismay particularly because he is regarded as close to mr bloomberg and would be unlikely to voice views that were not broadly accepted at the top of the company advertisement continue reading the main story in his comments on thursday mr grauer did not provide figures for the size of bloomberg’s business in china one former executive said in november that the company had about  to  terminals in mainland china out of  terminals worldwidemr grauer said the company was investing aggressively in fastgrowing emerging markets including china and dozens of other countries such nations account for about  percent of people who use bloomberg terminals but  percent of its sales in the year to date he said“our approach is pretty much to tune out all the news about weaknesses in the emerging markets” mr grauer said “we’re investing full speed ahead”in recent weeks mr bloomberg has taken up residence on the fifth floor of his company’s new york headquarters which primarily houses the television operation of bloomberg news the glass of a small conference room has been frosted since he arrived and he uses it to take spanish lessons an employee said his influence within the editorial unit has also increased since he left city hall said people with knowledge of the operation who insisted on anonymity in discussing internal operationsbloomberg has moved swiftly to put behind it a scandal in which its journalists were found to have used data from the terminals like contact information to help report stories reporters have been instructed in meetings employees said to avoid the use of proprietary information and to identify themselves clearly as from the news division the aim said one person present has clearly been to assure terminal customers that their information is safe continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page » site index the new york times peter t grauer on bloombergs commitment to africa  bloomberg lp search press announcements search for view all press announcements peter t grauer on bloomberg’s commitment to africa april   on april  peter t grauer spoke at a meeting of the president’s advisory council on doing business in africa emphasizing bloomberg’s commitment to the region grauer announced the establishment of a grant to the financial services volunteer corps and reinforced our continuing commitment to providing training via our terminal to african central bankers securities regulators and the private sector he also announced that bloomberg will host a business and economic summit in africa in early  his full remarks below thank you ed secretary pritzker the department of commerce and trade promotion coordinating committee and council members for your continued dedication to africa and your commitment to developing trade and investment strategies on the continent as you know africa has developed into a global economic force and bloomberg is fully committed to an advanced economic partnership between the us and africa we have  physical offices in  countries in africa but our presence extends to more than  countries – employing over a  people on our payroll and another  people as stringers producing content for our bloomberg news service we are growing and will continue to grow and invest for the future we work closely with africa’s financial institutions private companies and central bankers to help them maximize efficiency mitigate risk and increase capital flows this helps the local financial markets and helps attract more foreign investment bloomberg is currently working on several securities market development initiatives in africa for example we collaborated with a local regulator in nigeria to create a nigerian bond trading platform and market surveillance system to bring a more transparent liquid and efficient bond market to nigeria we also recently collaborated with the african development bank to create an african bond index we saw a clear need for a transparent and objective benchmark for sovereign debt in africa consistent with bloomberg’s efforts to strengthen africa’s financial markets i am pleased to offer a recommendation for our subcommittee that is focused on attracting investment and access to capital by making africa’s capital markets more robust africa’s capital markets are undergoing significant change that over time will facilitate an increased interest in the trading of all types of financial instruments throughout the continent africa’s securities commissions and exchanges are increasingly requesting the expertise of public and private sector experts with securities market development issues african securities markets range from very developed to nascent with no legislative or regulatory frameworks in place to that end the us securities and exchange commission has a technical assistance program that utilizes sec and industry officials as well as other seasoned practitioners to provide training and capacity building to regulatory officials all over the world however the program is very limited on resources and essentially has no funding this is why we recommend that the us government and private sector explore ways to provide the program with the funding necessary to be successful throughout the african continent we also recommend private sector participation in training to bolster these markets and provide expertise necessary for development of trading infrastructure to advance these goals and show our commitment to developing capital markets it is my pleasure to announce this morning that bloomberg is establishing a grant to the financial services volunteer corps to sponsor a technical assistance program in africa the fsvc is a notforprofit privatepublic partnership that helps to build sound financial systems in emerging market countries this grant will fund a training and capacity building program on the continent in an effort to strengthen securities markets the new initiative will have a positive impact on investment opportunities and african governments alike in addition to funding the grant we will continue our commitment at bloomberg to providing training via our terminal to african central bankers securities regulators and the private sector and we will also continue developing trading infrastructure similarly i would like to encourage other companies to share their expertise with those on the continent as well finally i am delighted to announce that bloomberg has committed to hosting a business and economic summit in africa in early  the summit tapping bloomberg’s editorial and analytical resources on the continent and beyond will convene top executives and policy makers for a deeper look at africa’s domestic economies and an exploration of their roles in changing the global economy bloomberg journalists will lead conversations focused on issues including energy technology infrastructure the opportunities and risks of doing business in the region and strengthening of africa’s capital markets thank you more posts july   bloomberg

completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
