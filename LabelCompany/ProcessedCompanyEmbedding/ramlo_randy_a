im pleased to present mr randy ramlo chief executive officer of united fire group randy ramlo thanks randy good morning everyone and welcome to ufg insurance fourth quarter and year end  conference call earlier this morning we reported net income and operating income of  per diluted share and a gaap combined ratio of  for the fourth quarter  this compares with net income and operating income of  per diluted share and a gaap combined ratio of  in the fourth quarter of  for the year  net income was  per diluted share operating income  per diluted share and our gaap combined ratio was  this compares to prior year net income of  per diluted share operating income of  per diluted share and a gaap combined ratio of  don will address the quarterly and fullyear financial results in a few minutes the fullyear of  were primarily impacted by two items first an increase in catastrophe losses as compared to   was a quiet year for catastrophe losses only adding  percentage points to the combined ratio as compared to  when catastrophe losses added  percentage points to the combined ratio the level catastrophe losses in  is within our expectations and is normally what we would expect in a given year aligning closely with our  year historical average of  percentage points on the combined ratio the second item impacted our  results was a deterioration in our core loss ratio a portion of this deterioration was driven by an increase of large losses which we defined as losses greater than  the large losses were primarily in our commercial automobile and commercial property lines in a few moments mike will go over into more detail regarding these losses and the strategies we have put in place or will be put in place to adjust this deterioration last year at this time we announced a milestone of  billion in total revenue in the first time in company history again in  we achieved another milestone earning  billion in net premiums this milestone included a   increase in net premiums earned in  as compared to  although were proud of this milestone looking ahead to  and where were in the current softening market cycle we believe that the pace of our premium growth will slow moderately compared to the level of growth we have experienced since the beginning of  as we have discussed all year  was a challenging year for our life segment for the year  we had a net income of  as compared to  million in  as we mentioned in our third quarter call beginning on january   we implemented a number of strategies to improve the profitability of the life segment the changes are already implemented include product pricing adjustments and restructuring of our commissions were also looking at our current product mix and exploring opportunities to expand our product offerings in a state we currently write business we believe these strategies are positive steps to approve profitability our life insurance segment since the second quarter of  our expense ratio has been at or below  percentage points were satisfied with the progress we have made this year to reduce our expenses and maintain an expense ratio near  percentage points we will always continue to look for efficiencies but we believe we have achieved an acceptable operating expense level  proved to be another year of milestone and accomplishments for ufg in addition to the premium milestone we accomplished this year we also recognized our th year in business our th year as a publicly held company and our th year will be listed on the nasdaq which we celebrated by bring ringing the nasdaq opening bell in april besides these milestones ufg also received several outstanding recognitions including being named to forbes americas topmost trustworthy financial companies list for the third year in a row and being selected as a top workplace by the des moines register while were proud of the accomplishments in  were disappointed with the deterioration in our core loss ratio in response to this were reviewing and working on implementing more rigorous loss control efforts stricter underwriting guidelines rate increases and new analytics tools which mike wilkins will now discuss in more detail mike michael wilkins thanks randy good morning everyone as randy indicated one of the items impacting our results in  was an increase in catastrophe losses as compared to an exceptionally low cat year in  this is catastrophe losses are in line with our expectations for any given year adding  points to the combined ratio which aligns with our  year historical average of  of the combined ratio the majority of this years catastrophe losses occurred in the second and third quarters primarily due to related to weatherrelated events the second item which was impacted our results in  was a deterioration in our core loss ratio impacted by an increase in large losses primarily in our commercial automobile and commercial property lines during  large losses totaled  million compared to  million in  as we discussed during last quarters call the majority of large commercial property losses occurred in the third quarter when we incurred five large commercial fire losses for a total of  million his spies were geographically spread out with no recurring patterns however we have implemented many loss control initiatives to reduce commercial fire losses including more emphasis on electrical systems hvac and other systems especially in older buildings and buildings in unprotected area strict compliance loss control recommendation and expanded use of technologies such as infrared thermography for commercial auto losses continue to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of  due to an increase in the severity of claims were currently asking for and receiving rate increases between  and  depending on the region for new business and renewal premiums along with implementing these rate increases we have already implemented many loss control initiatives to reduce commercial auto losses including enforcement of vehicle use policies required driver training vehicle maintenance programs and reducing umbrella and excess limits in certain regions further loss control initiatives including implementing predicting analytics in our underwriting process in mid for personal auto were achieving rate increases the mid to upper single digit range and we continue to expand the use of telematics in the use of analytics as compared to exceptional results in  our loss ratio on workers compensation deteriorated in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter our loss ratio on workers compensations increased to  points over the fourth quarter of  we attribute this change to increase in severity of claims over  workers compensation losses can be volatile quarter over quarter therefore we will continue to monitor this line of business during the fourth quarter we saw an increase in competition and a further softening of the market which was most evident in our midwest region overall commercial lines renewal pricing for the group was flat to a slight increase pricing varied by region and size of account commercial auto and commercial property rate increases continue to be in the mid to upper single digits other casualty lines and workers compensation rate increases are flat or slightly negative we believe that loss cost trends are approximately  personal lines renewal pricing increase with average percentage increases in the low to midsingle digits primarily in homeowners and personal auto premium and policy retention remains strong at  and  respectively with changes from prior quarter of approximately  our success ratio on quoted accounts was up  from the prior quarter remaining at an acceptable level during the fourth quarter property and casualty premiums written increased  as compared fourth quarter of   is attributed to new business and  is attributable to endorsement and audits both of these are partially offset by a  decline and rate and exposure changes for the year  property casually written premiums increase  as compared to   is attributable to new business and the remaining increase is due to rate changes endorsements audits and exposure increases with that i will turn financial discussion over to dawn jaffray dawn jaffray thanks mike and good morning for the fourth quarter of  we reported consolidated net income of  million or  and per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the fourth quarter of  for the year  consolidated net income was  million and  per diluted share compared to  million and  per diluted share in  the decrease in net income in the fourth quarter and fullyear  as compared to  is primarily due to an increase of in catastrophe losses and a deterioration in our core loss ratio a portion of which was due to an increase in large losses previously discussed by randy and mike our shareholders equity increased  to  million at december   from  million as december   book value increased  to  at december   from  at december   the increases in shareholders equity and book value are primarily due to net income of  million an increase in unrealized investment gains of  million to  million a change benefits and valuation of our post retirement obligations which contributed  million all partially offset by a payment of shareholders dividends of  million on a positive note the changes we implemented to take effect at the beginning of  will result in an estimated  million net decrease in future expense for our postretirement benefit plan return on equity was  for  compared to  for  the decrease in roe as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to combination of decrease in net income and increase in shareholders equity our return on equity excluding unrealized investment gains was  for  losses and loss settlement expenses increased by  million or  during the fourth quarter  compared to the fourth quarter of  for the year  losses and loss settlement expenses increased by  million or  when compared to  again the primary driver of the increases in  were large losses and catastrophe losses as we discussed favorable reserve development for the fourth quarter of  was  million compared to  million in fourth quarter  the impact on net income for the fourth quarter in  was  per diluted share compared to  per diluted share in the fourth quarter of  for the  year favorable reserve development totaled  million compared to  million in  the impact on net income in  was  per diluted share compared to  per diluted share in  for the fourth quarter  the majority of the favorable development came from two lines commercial liability with  million unfavorable development and personal fire with  million the favorable development was offset by reserver strengthening in commercial auto with  million in assumed reinsurance with  million of adverse development for the year  the majority of favorable development came from two lines commercial liability with  million and workers compensation with  million the favorable development was offset by a reserve strengthening in commercial property lines was  million and commercial auto with  million of adverse development the combined ratio the fourth quarter of  was  and a  for the year   comparatives were  for the fourth quarter and  for the year removing the impact of catastrophe losses and reserved development our core loss ratio deteriorated  points in the fourth quarter and  points for the year when compared with  the primary drivers of the deterioration in the core loss ratio are an increase in large commercial property and commercial auto losses as well as workers compensation losses referring to slide nine in our slide deck on our website we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact of catastrophes and development on the combined ratio now moving to investments consolidated net investment income was  million for the fourth quarter  or a  increase as compared to  million in the fourth quarter  yeartodate  consolidated net investment income was  million which represented a  increase when compared to  the increase in net investment income for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by the change in value of our investments limited liability partnerships as compared to the same period in  and not due to a change in our investment philosophy this resulted in an increase of  million and  million respectively in investment income during the fourth quarter and fullyear  as compared to the same periods of  with respect to capital management activity during the fourth quarter we declared and paid a  per share cash dividend to stockholders of record on december st  we have paid a quarterly dividend every quarters since march  under our share repurchase program we may purchase united fire common stock from time to time on the open market or through private renegotiated transactions the amount and timing of any purchases will be at managements discretion and will depend upon a number of factors including the share price general economic and market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements during the fourth quarter we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of  for total cost of  million for the year  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of  with a total cost of  million were authorized by the board of directors to purchase an additional  shares of common stock under our share repurchase program which expires in august  and with that i will now open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from paul newsome of sandler oneill please go ahead paul newsome could you talk perhaps just a little bit more about what the results would have been if you pulled out the large losses themselves was are also deterioration in the underwriting if you just pull out those large losses michael wilkins paul this is mike wilkins answer would be yes there was deterioration if you pull out the large losses the large losses probably if you look at that quarter deterioration made up a little over a third of the deterioration the rest of the deterioration was just you know core deterioration paul newsome any notable patterns in that core deterioration michael wilkins well i would say it was in auto and property lines that we have talked about and also work comp the issue with work comp is the results we had in  we still are pleased with it was just  was such a good year that the difference between the two led to some of the deterioration in the difference between our loss ratio numbers between the two years paul newsome the nonworkers comp whats going on with that deterioration ex the big cat the big losses michael wilkins im not sure i understand your question randy ramlo i think hes just probably this is randy paul we have probably been talking about commercial auto for a while and we all know the usual suspects mileages is up qualified drivers are difficult to find we see a lot of evidence of distracted driving were going to be as we mentioned raising rates fairly aggressively on this line and walking away from business if we have to the commercial auto line rates will help that for us but that can not be the only answer we have a lot of loss control initiatives trying to help our insured people to just to be better drivers and then on the property if i had to characterize anything it is probably having to do with a little bit older properties and then the catastrophic losses that we did have in  was another area where some of those property lines came from we had some notable activity in the gatlinburg tennessee wildfires we normally dont have a lot of exposure to wildfires as we dont write a lot of property out west that happened in the fourth quarter which normally our fourth quarter is a pretty quiet cat quarter but this time that contributed a little bit to that as well those are the main areas were seeing commercial auto on the severity side and on the property side as well paul newsome two quick ones i think you said that i missed the cost savings from the pension change what would that be in  dawn jaffray it will be  million per year paul newsome and then it looked like there was a very good quarter for investment income anything that was unusual in the quarter barrie ernst well the financials were up strong in the fourth quarter and we have some large investments in the financial areas in our llcs this is barrie so i think that was the cause of most of the increase in investment income and that flows through to the investment income operator the next question comes from quentin mcmillan of kbw quentin mcmillan i just wanted to talk about the growth initiatives that you guys have in their in the press release for  you said that the growth was slow moderately could you give a little more color you have grown double digits consistently over the past couple years so obviously its pretty impressive what is moderate mean are we still looking for growth and any kind of range would be helpful randy ramlo this is randy were still looking to grow in  the past as you said we probably been growing around  or a hair more and i would say we hope to be able to grow at about half pace so we the  to  range will be pretty satisfactory in this market cycle i think quentin mcmillan okay great and then you talked about the profitability initiatives in there in the life insurance operation previously also dividend some of the capital from the life back to the pmc did you do any of that this year and would that also be part of a plan of the pmc operations are earning a little bit better than what the life are currently randy ramlo a we did not dividend this year quinton our plans are sometime in the very new features of to continue that quentin mcmillan and then i just dawn a numbers question i think that you said in your remarks aoci finished the year at  million i do not have the number in the press release but that would be flat with the third quarter is that actually right because that would indicate unrealized losses in the quarter dawn jaffray it down slightly quentin mcmillan okay so there was some degree of book value hit associated with a loss in aoci as everybody else saw obviously right dawn jaffray year over year it was less there was a significant drop in the quarter to fourth quarter but yearoveryear it was down about i believe it was  million quentin mcmillan okay thanks very much and then just one last quick question in terms of the commercial auto book obviously you have talked about some the initiatives that youre taking and obviously getting a lot of price and a lot of rate is going to be a good thing that will earn in over time but do you have an indication as to what you target the loss ratio of that book to be or qualitatively where you need it to be to make sense for you to write that michael wilkins quentin this is mike we will probably look at account loss ratio more than individual lines but we expect all the lines to stand on their own as well so we look at an overall basis by line but an individual account sometimes the auto pricing we can have some flexibility with were probably  points from where wed like that line to be on a loss ratio basis operator operator instructions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to randy patten for any closing

randy ramlo thanks randy good morning everyone and welcome to ufg insurance third quarter  conference call earlier this morning we reported net income of  per diluted share operating income of  per diluted share and a gaap combined ratio of  for the third quarter this compares with net income of  per diluted share operating income of  per diluted share and a gaap combined ratio of  in the third quarter of  dawn will address the quarterly and yeartodate financial results later in a few minutes the third quarter results were within our expectations and were highlighted by continued organic premium growth increased investment income and catastrophe losses below our tenyear historical average for third quarters on a less positive note our quarterly results were impacted by an increase in large commercial fire losses and an increase in commercial auto losses i will let mike discuss losses and the impact of our loss ratio in a few moments in the property and casualty segment we continue to meet our organic growth objectives with expansion in targeted geographical locations net premiums earned increased  during the third quarter and  yeartodate in  as compared to the same periods in  we anticipate continued momentum from our expansion initiatives for the remainder of  and remain focused on maintaining underwriting discipline as we grow the top line as a reminder some of our growth initiatives our targeted geographic expansion include expanding into the state of ohio in the fourth quarter of  and recently the state of kentucky in the third quarter of  along with adding our workers’ compensation product in the state of texas in the fourth quarter of  im pleased to report that with the state of ohio were off to a good start with written premium within our expectations in the state of kentucky we began selling our commercial lines and products in the third quarter of  which will be followed with personal lines in  in the state of texas we added our workers’ compensation line with the first premium received in october  renewal rate increases for both commercial lines and personal lines averaged in the low single digits in the third quarter this is our th consecutive quarter of renewal pricing increases in our commercial auto and commercial property lines of business however the rate increases are not matching the increase in loss cost for new business the rate increases for commercial lines of business were in commercial auto and commercial property lines of business we did not seek any rate increases on new business for personal lines in the third quarter mike will provide more specifics with respect to the pc market conditions and performance in a few moments as we discussed in prior quarters the current interest rate environment has presented challenges during  in our life segment although we had net income in the third quarter of  as compared to a net loss in the second quarter of  our expectation is that profitability in this segment will be difficult the remainder of the year we are aggressively making changes to our strategy in the life segment with life product pricing adjustments and restructuring our commission structure in  were also working on creating efficiencies in our life segment such as our recent automation of our deferred annuity application process by implementing eapplication and esignature in the third quarter we believe these actions will result in reductions in operating expenses and an increase in profitability in our life insurance our expense ratio for the third quarter was  percentage points of the combined ratio compared to  percentage points in the same period in  were pleased with the progress were making in reducing our expense ratio we’re continually looking for efficiencies to manage our expenses as we strive to reach our ultimate goal of an annual expense ratio of  percentage points im pleased to report that on september   am best affirmed our financial strength a excellent rating for the property and casualty subsidiaries of united fire group collectively known as united fire  casualty group and also affirmed the financial strength rating of a or excellent for united life insurance company both with a stable outlook finally i’ll end this morning with an update on ufg’s exposure to hurricane mathew today we have only received a few claims related to this catastrophe with an estimated loss that’s lesser than  we have contacted the majority of our policyholders that are not yet expecting any further material developments from this event with that i’ll turn the discussion over to mike wilkins our chief operating officer michael wilkins thanks randy and good morning everyone as randy indicated our catastrophe losses impacted the combined ratio and the third quarter was  percentage points as compared to our tenyear historical average for third quarters of  percentage points while the impact is below our tenyear historical average we believe further geographical diversification will contribute to lowering our catastrophe loss impact in the future on a yeartodate basis for the first nine months of  catastrophe losses impact to the combined ratio was  percentage points compared to our tenyear historical average for the first nine months at  percentage point the increase is primarily due to weatherrelated catastrophe losses incurred during the second quarter of this year as a reminder our expectation for catastrophe losses in any given year is  percentage points for the combined ratio with the second and third quarters being the most significant quarters with storm and catastrophe events in geographic areas where we conduct much of our business in the third quarter of  we experienced an increase in large losses which we define as losses greater than  large losses totaled  million in the third quarter of  compared to  million in the third quarter of  yeartodate large losses totaled  million in  compared to  million in  the increase in large losses is primarily due to an increase in commercial fire losses during the third quarter we incurred five large commercial property losses for a total of  million these fires were geographically spread out with no recurring patterns however we are in the process of completing audits and identifying changes that are needed to reduce commercial property losses commercial auto losses continued to deteriorate in the third quarter of  due to an increase in frequency and severity of claims our experience is similar to what were seeing throughout the industry right now which we believe is attributable to an increase in miles driven a reduction in the unemployment rate and distracted driving we’re currently asking for and receiving rate increases on our commercial auto new business and renewal premiums we are currently asking for and receiving rate increases between  and  depending on the region along with implementing these rate increases in many of the states we write we’ve also taken several initiatives to reduce commercial auto losses including underwriting several of our accounts lowering some of the limits we offer and expanding into new initiatives in the areas of predictive analytics and telematics similar to the second quarter our loss ratio on workers’ compensation deteriorated in the third quarter in the third quarter our loss ratio on workers’ compensation increased  points over an unusually low loss ratio in the third quarter of  we attribute this change to an increase in severity of claims over  despite the increase the loss ratio continues to be within our expectations for this line of business our workers’ compensation losses can be volatile quarteroverquarter therefore we will continue to monitor this line of business during the third quarter we continued to see competitive market conditions for both renewals and new business renewal pricing for both commercial lines and personal lines averaged in the low single digits we had the most successful increases in commercial auto and commercial property lines of business offset by a decrease in workers’ compensation rates this is the th consecutive quarter of commercial lines pricing increases on our overall book of business the increases in our personal lines continue to be in homeowners and personal auto lines of business premium and policy retention remained strong at  and  respectively with changes from the prior quarter of less than  respectively our success ratio on quoted accounts was down  from the prior three quarters but remains at an acceptable level we continue to be more successful on accounts with premiums less than  during the third quarter property and casualty premiums written increased  as compared to the third quarter of   is attributed to new business and the remaining increase is due to rate changes endorsements audits and exposure increases yeartodate property and casualty written increased  as compared to the same period of   is attributable to new business the remaining increased is due to rate changes endorsements audits and exposure increases with that i’ll turn the financial discussion over to dawn jaffray dawn jaffray thanks mike and good morning for the third quarter of  we reported consolidated net income of  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the third quarter of  through nine months  yeartodate consolidated net income was  million and  per diluted share as compared to  million and  per diluted share in  the decrease in net income in the third quarter and yeartodate as compared to  is primarily due to an increase in large losses and an increase in catastrophe losses previously discussed by randy and mike our shareholders’ equity increased  to  million at september   from  million at december   book value increased  to  at september   from  at december   the increase in shareholders’ equity and book value are primarily due to net income of  million and an increase in unrealized investment gains of  million consolidated unrealized investment gains were  million at september   return on equity was  in the first nine months of  compared to  in the first nine months of  the decrease in roe as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to a combination of decrease in net income and increase in shareholders’ equity losses and loss settlement expenses increased by  million or  during the third quarter  as compared to the third quarter of  on a yeartodate basis losses and loss settlement expenses increased  million or  compared to the same period of  the primary driver of the increase in third quarter is large losses and catastrophe losses as we previously mentioned as has been historical reserving practice at ufg we set initial reserves conservatively as a result we often have favorable reserve adjustments that vary from yeartoyear across our book of business favorable reserve development for the third quarter  was  million which was flat as compared to the third quarter of  the impact on net income for the third quarter in  was  per share which is flat as compared to the third quarter of  on a yeartodate basis favorable reserve development for  totaled  million compared to  million in  the impact on net income in  was  per share compared to  per share in  two line together provide the majority of the favorable reserve development in the first nine months of  the largest contributors to our favorable development were commercial liability with  million and workers’ compensation with  million all of these lines benefited from successful claims management and continued successful management of litigation expenses the favorable development is attributable to reductions in reserves for loss adjustment expenses which continue to benefit from continued management in our litigation area these lines were slightly offset by  million of adverse development in the commercial fire line of business which experienced an increased in paid claims the combined ratio in the third quarter  was  and  yeartodate  compared were  for the third quarter and  yeartodate removing the impact of catastrophe losses in reserve development our core loss ratio deteriorated  percentage points in the third quarter and  percentage points yeartodate when compared with  results the primary drivers of this deterioration in the core loss ratio are an increase in the large commercial fire losses increase in commercial auto and workers’ compensation losses as previously mentioned referring to slide nine in our slide deck on our website we’ve provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact of catastrophes and the development on the combined ratio moving on to investments consolidated net investment income was  million for the third quarter of  or an  increase as compared to  million in the third quarter  yeartodate  consolidated net investment income was  million which represents a  decrease when compared to  the increase in net investment income for the quarter was primarily driven by the change in value of investments in limited liability partnerships as compared to the same period of  and not due to a change in our investment philosophy this resulted in  million increase in investment income during the third quarter  as compared to the same period of  yeartodate the decrease in investment income is primarily due to a declining reinvestment interest rate in our life portfolio with respect to capital management activity during the third quarter we declared and paid a  per share cash dividend to stockholders of record on september   i emphasize that we have consistently paid a quarterly dividend every quarter since march of  under our share repurchase program we made – purchased united fire common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the amount and timing of any purchases will be at management’s discretion and will depend on a number of factors including its share price general economics and market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements during the third quarter we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of  and a total cost of  million we are authorized by the board of directors to purchase an additional  shares of common stock under our share repurchase program which expires in august  and with that ill now open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from paul newsome of sandler o’neill please go ahead paul newsome good morning could you walk through the loss ratio deteriorations for i guess property auto and workers’ comp and talk about the prospects of whether or not those loss ratios will improve prospectively given what youre doing at the moment and how quickly you think that could change randy ramlo well the tough part of that question is how quickly that can change on the workers’ compensation part we had some deterioration but we’re kind of far from a disaster that line was pretty good last year better than – i think we said better than we probably expected it to be i think the good news there is – it’s kind of an industry problem so i think a problem is always easier to cure if everybody’s kind of feeling the same pain so far i think this is still kind of something we can cure through rate increases and we’ve filed for rate increases already and those rate increases are going in fairly successfully we also have had a lot of really large losses and have had to change our stance on providing large umbrellas on some heavier fleets on commercial auto i think that will help very quickly because i think we’re pretty much around the horn on reducing the umbrella coverage on a lot of the auto fleets mike mentioned that we have some analytics projects underway specifically a pilot program and i think that will have some pay off certainly within  months and then the commercial fire kind of the couple areas there that we did an audit and took a look at our property book couple of things that we found is not always having diligent implementation of loss control recommendation and not on large accounts but more on mediumsize accounts so a lot of times small insureds aren’t able to implement loss control recommendation so we have to do a better job of making sure that if we have loss control recommendations we get them implemented or get off the account and then the last thing we found is that we probably have to do a little bit better job of underwriting older buildings specifically we have a church program that inherently – churches are often very old so we have to again make sure loss control reccs implemented but hopefully we can see some improvement in these loss ratios certainly by the first part or the second quarter of next year paul newsome and then maybe kind of a broad question here your slides that came out about the same time of the call talked about a  goal of increasing return on equity maybe you could just walk through what the levers you’re going to pull to achieve that goal randy ramlo first of all we’ve got to get three lines we talked about earlier under some better control we probably have some branches that we need to become a little bit more profitable we’re having good success with growth and kind of interestingly the branches that are growing the least actually have some of the more elevated loss ratios so we’ll continue to be diligent on rate we think that’s always a way to kind of help things we think property diversification which part of our mercer acquisition we hope that we can continue to see the contribution of cat losses kind of slowly coming down in years to come so hopefully growing property in especially the western states and parts of the northeast can help with those things those are kind of some of the levers that we will continue to pull paul newsome great thanks appreciate it randy ramlo thank you paul operator operator instructions there being no more questions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back to
