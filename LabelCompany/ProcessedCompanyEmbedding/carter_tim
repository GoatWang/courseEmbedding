small engines run much better and avoid problems this is but one ethanolfree product that helps small engines run much better and avoid problems tim carter tim carter tribune content agencyask the builder dear tim ive got a lawn mower a snow blower and a garden tiller with small gasoline engines im about to purchase a log splitter that has one i dont want any problems and want to avoid any damage to the new engine and the existing ones ive heard that the current gasoline with ethanol in it is really bad for small engines are the stabilizer products really good what is wrong with the ethanol are there alternative fuels that are smallengine friendly  steve g monument colodear steve if we were playing small engine poker id call your small engine machines and raise you a power washer yes ive got a wide assortment of gasolinepowered equipment too small engines used to be the bane of my existence with hardstarting issues but those days are long gone now that i know the truth about ethanolbased gasolinerecent survey results have shown that most consumers place a very high value on ease of starting and ease of maintenance with small engines one of the most important factors in ease of starting an engine is the fuel you put in itwhat youve heard about ethanol in gasoline is true small engine repair shops love ethanol because it provides them with a steady stream of business but if you get one of these shop owners to open up with you hell probably tell you he doesnt use that gasoline in his own small engines ethanol attracts water water enters your fuel system in the air that enters the fuel tank as the gasoline is burned by the engine the water is drawn into the gasoline making for a chemical mix that accelerates corrosion of metal parts in the enginewhen the fuel level is low in the tank the water can condense on the cool surfaces of the tank this water then runs down and gets into the gasoline if enough water collects in the tank it can get drawn into the engine where it can cause the engine to run poorlyethanol acts as a solvent in older engines and can dissolve old gum and varnish deposits from the gas tank and fuel lines these deposits can then clog the very small orifices in the carburetor if this happens your good day turns bad very quickly as your small engine will not start no matter how many curse words you hurl at itgasoline can also oxidize or rust just like iron or steel when gasoline oxidizes you dont get orange flakes of rust you get gum and varnish in the gasoline that causes clogs the reason you dont have trouble with ethanol in most cars is because you tend to get new gasoline on a regular basis as you drive your car each day or every other day ethanolcontaining gasoline can deteriorate in just  daysmost of the fuel stabilizer products do a great job of protecting small engines these additives are primarily antioxidants they grab oxygen thats in the gasoline preventing it from turning into gum and varnishreally good stabilizers work not only in the liquid gasoline but in the air or vapor thats on top of the gasoline in the partially filled gas tank look for stabilizer products that say they offer vapor technology to treat the air and vapor thats floating above the gasoline in the tank remember this air contains watervery few people take the time to fill a small engine gas tank after each use doing this minimizes the amount of available oxygen that can cause problems when you decide to fill your small engine tank always fill it to about  percent of the way so the gasoline wont expand and leak out if the garage shed or patio gets hot from the sunif you have a can of older gasoline in your garage from the winter summer or fall just put it into whatever car or truck is driven the most it will mix with the fresh gasoline and will not hurt your car if you get it filled up once the tank is near emptyif youre using a fuel stabilizer for the first time and have untreated gas in your small engine start up the engine and allow it to run for about three minutes this allows treated fuel to be drawn up into the fuel lines and carburetor you want stabilized gasoline to extend from the gas tank all the way up to the intake valve so you get no corrosion happening while the engine is in storagethe good news is you can buy gasoline for your small engines that doesnt contain ethanol many businesses that sell machines with small gasoline engines stock cans of ethanolfree gasoline that already has the stabilizer chemicals in it most people are unaware of this resource you can even get these fuels for twocycle engines with the twocycle oil already added as well as the stabilizeranother resource is a local airport used by small aircraft youll almost always find an fbo or fixedbase operator at these small to mediumsized airports airplanes that use gasoline have engines that will not tolerate ethanol so the gasoline sold at these airports is free of the problemcausing ingredientif you take an approved fuel can these businesses will almost always sell you the sweet nectar your small engine will devour the octane of this gasoline is higher and your small engine will think its eating a piece of double chocolate cake with mocha icing you know how that puts a smile on your face imagine how happy your small engine will be you should add the stabilizer to this ethanolfree gasoline if you decide to use itneed an answer all of tims past columns are archived for free at httpwwwaskthebuildercom you can also watch hundreds of videos download quick start guides
