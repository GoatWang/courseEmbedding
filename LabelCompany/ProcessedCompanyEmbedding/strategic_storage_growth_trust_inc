investment such information would be comparable only for publicly registered nontraded reits that have generally completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics by excluding expensed acquisition related expenses ssgt believes mffo provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with managements analysis of the investing and operating performance of its properties acquisition fees and expenses include payments to ssgts advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by ssgt unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property noncash items included in net loss provided below is additional information related to selected noncash items included in net loss above which may be helpful in assessing ssgts operating results • debt issuance costs of approximately  and  respectively were recognized for the three months ended march   and  additional information regarding noi ffo and mffo net operating income noi noi is a nongaap measure that ssgt defines as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap generated from properties before corporate general and administrative expenses asset management fees interest expense depreciation amortization acquisition expenses and other nonproperty related expenses ssgt believes that noi is useful for investors as it provides a measure of the operating performance of its operating assets because noi excludes certain items that are not associated with the operation of the properties additionally ssgt believes that noi is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community however ssgts use of the term noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount funds from operations ffo and modified funds from operations mffo due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations or ffo which ssgt believes to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not equivalent to ssgts net income loss as determined under gaap ssgt defines ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  or the white paper the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ssgts ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described above the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time diminution in value may occur if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or other measures necessary to maintain the assets are not undertaken however ssgt believes that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions including inflation interest rates the business cycle unemployment and consumer spending presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative in addition in the determination of ffo ssgt believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time an asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying value or book value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows including net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under gaap from such asset testing for impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis investors should note however that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property including estimated future net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of ffo as described above investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that ssgt intends to have a relatively limited term of its operations it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property to date ssgt has not recognized any impairments historical accounting for real estate involves the use of gaap any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in gaap nevertheless ssgt believes that the use of ffo which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments assists in providing a more complete understanding of its performance to investors and to its management and when compared year over year reflects the impact on ssgts operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs which may not be immediately apparent from net income loss however ffo or modified funds from operations mffo discussed below should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current gaap methodology in calculating net income loss or in its applicability in evaluating ssgts operating performance the method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under gaap should be considered a more relevant measure of operational performance and is therefore given more prominence than the nongaap ffo and mffo measures and the adjustments to gaap in calculating ffo and mffo changes in the accounting and reporting rules under gaap that were put into effect and other changes to gaap accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of nareits definition of ffo have prompted an increase in cashsettled expenses specifically acquisition fees and expenses that are expensed as operating expenses under gaap ssgt believes these fees and expenses do not affect its overall longterm operating performance publicly registered nontraded reits typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation the purchase of properties and the corresponding expenses associated with that process is a key feature of ssgts business plan in order to generate operational income and cash flow in order to make distributions to investors while other startup entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years ssgt believes that publicly registered nontraded reits are unique in that they typically have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases as disclosed in the prospectus for ssgts offering ssgt will use the proceeds raised in its offering to acquire properties and ssgt expects to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event ie listing of its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger or sale the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or another similar transaction within three to five years after the completion of its offering which is generally comparable to other publicly registered nontraded reits thus ssgt does not intend to continuously purchase assets and intends to have a limited life the decision whether to engage in any liquidity event is in the sole discretion of the board of directors of ssgt due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered nontraded reits the investment program association or the ipa an industry trade group has standardized a measure known as mffo which the ipa has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered nontraded reits and which ssgt believes to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered nontraded reit having the characteristics described above mffo is not equivalent to ssgts net income loss as determined under gaap and mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance on value if ssgt does not ultimately engage in a liquidity event ssgt believes that because mffo excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect its operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that ssgt considers more reflective of investing activities as well as other nonoperating items included in ffo mffo can provide on a goingforward basis an indication of the sustainability that is the capacity to continue to be maintained of ssgts operating performance after the period in which it is acquiring properties and once its portfolio is in place by providing mffo ssgt believes it is presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering has been completed and its properties have been acquired ssgt also believes that mffo is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered nontraded reit industry further ssgt believes mffo is useful in comparing the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities investors are cautioned that mffo should only be used to assess the sustainability of ssgts operating performance after its offering has been completed and properties have been acquired as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on ssgts operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired ssgt defines mffo a nongaap measure consistent with the ipas guideline  supplemental performance measure for publicly registered nonlisted reits modified funds from operations the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november  the practice guideline defines mffo as ffo further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of gaap net income loss acquisition fees and expenses amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above or below intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments nonrecurring impairments of real estate related investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting adjustments relating to contingent purchase price obligations included in net income and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments unrealized gains and losses on hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income loss in calculating cash flows from operations and in some cases reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized ssgts mffo calculation complies with the ipas practice guideline described above in calculating mffo ssgt excludes acquisition related expenses the other adjustments included in the ipas practice guideline are not applicable to ssgt for the periods presented acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by ssgt and it has not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from its offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses ssgt does not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses acquisition fees and expenses include payments to ssgts advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by ssgt unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property in the future if ssgt is not able to raise additional proceeds from its offering this could result in ssgt paying acquisition fees or reimbursing acquisition expenses due to its advisor or a portion thereof with net proceeds from borrowed funds operational earnings or cash flows net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows as a result the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced or ssgt may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds further under gaap certain contemplated noncash fair value and other noncash adjustments are considered operating noncash adjustments to net income loss in determining cash flows from operations in addition ssgt views fair value adjustments of derivatives and the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance ssgt uses mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate its performance against other publicly registered nontraded reits which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter as noted above mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance if ssgt does not continue to operate in this manner ssgt believes that its use of mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it allow it to present its performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered nontraded reits such as their limited life limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy and hence that the use of such measures may be useful to investors for example acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of ssgts offering and other financing sources and not from operations by excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses the use of mffo provides information consistent with managements analysis of the operating performance of the properties additionally fair value adjustments which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates may not be directly related or attributable to ssgts current operating performance by excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses ssgt believes mffo provides useful supplemental information presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and mffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and mffo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations as an indication of ssgts performance as an alternative to cash flows from operations which is an indication of ssgts liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund ssgts cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders ffo and mffo should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of ssgts performance mffo may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete  neither the sec nareit nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that ssgt uses to calculate ffo or mffo in the future the sec nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered nontraded reit industry and ssgt would have to adjust its calculation and characterization of ffo or mffo about strategic storage growth trust inc ssgt ssgt

this amountfunds from operations ffo and modified funds from operations mffodue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations or ffo which ssgt believes to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not equivalent to ssgts net income loss as determined under gaapssgt defines ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  or the white paper the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ssgts ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described abovethe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straightline depreciation of buildings and improvements which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time diminution in value may occur if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or other measures necessary to maintain the assets are not undertaken however ssgt believes that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions including inflation interest rates the business cycle unemployment and consumer spending presentations of operating results for a reit using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative in addition in the determination of ffo ssgt believes it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time an asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying value or book value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows including net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under gaap from such asset testing for impairment is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis investors should note however that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property including estimated future net rental revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of ffo as described above investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that ssgt intends to have a relatively limited term of its operations it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property to date ssgt has not recognized any impairmentshistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of gaap any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in gaap nevertheless ssgt believes that the use of ffo which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments assists in providing a more complete understanding of its performance to investors and to its management and when compared year over year reflects the impact on ssgts operations from trends in occupancy rates rental rates operating costs general and administrative expenses and interest costs which may not be immediately apparent from net income losshowever ffo or modified funds from operations mffo discussed below should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current gaap methodology in calculating net income loss or in its applicability in evaluating ssgts operating performance the method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under gaap should be considered a more relevant measure of operational performance and is therefore given more prominence than the nongaap ffo and mffo measures and the adjustments to gaap in calculating ffo and mffochanges in the accounting and reporting rules under gaap that were put into effect and other changes to gaap accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of nareits definition of ffo have prompted an increase in cashsettled expenses specifically acquisition fees and expenses that are expensed as operating expenses under gaap ssgt believes these fees and expenses do not affect its overall longterm operating performance publicly registered nontraded reits typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation the purchase of properties and the corresponding expenses associated with that process is a key feature of ssgts business plan in order to generate operational income and cash flow in order to make distributions to investors while other startup entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years ssgt believes that publicly registered nontraded reits are unique in that they typically have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases as disclosed in the prospectus for ssgts offering ssgt will use the proceeds raised in its offering to acquire properties and ssgt expects to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event ie listing of its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger or sale the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or another similar transaction within three to five years after the completion of its offering which is generally comparable to other publicly registered nontraded reits thus ssgt does not intend to continuously purchase assets and intends to have a limited life the decision whether to engage in any liquidity event is in the sole discretion of the board of directors of ssgt due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered nontraded reits the investment program association or the ipa an industry trade group has standardized a measure known as mffo which the ipa has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered nontraded reits and which ssgt believes to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a publicly registered nontraded reit having the characteristics described above mffo is not equivalent to ssgts net income loss as determined under gaap and mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance on value if ssgt does not ultimately engage in a liquidity event ssgt believes that because mffo excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect its operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that ssgt considers more reflective of investing activities as well as other nonoperating items included in ffo mffo can provide on a goingforward basis an indication of the sustainability that is the capacity to continue to be maintained of ssgts operating performance after the period in which it is acquiring properties and once its portfolio is in place by providing mffo ssgt believes it is presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering has been completed and its properties have been acquired ssgt also believes that mffo is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the publicly registered nontraded reit industry further ssgt believes mffo is useful in comparing the sustainability of its operating performance after its offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities investors are cautioned that mffo should only be used to assess the sustainability of ssgts operating performance after its offering has been completed and properties have been acquired as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on ssgts operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquiredssgt defines mffo a nongaap measure consistent with the ipas guideline  supplemental performance measure for publicly registered nonlisted reits modified funds from operations the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november  the practice guideline defines mffo as ffo further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of gaap net income loss acquisition fees and expenses amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above or below intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments nonrecurring impairments of real estate related investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting adjustments relating to contingent purchase price obligations included in net income and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments unrealized gains and losses on hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income loss in calculating cash flows from operations and in some cases reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realizedssgts mffo calculation complies with the ipas practice guideline described above in calculating mffo ssgt excludes acquisition related expenses the other adjustments included in the ipas practice guideline are not applicable to ssgt for the periods presented acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by ssgt and it has not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from its offering to be used to fund acquisition fees and expenses ssgt does not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows nor from the sale of properties and subsequent redeployment of capital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses acquisition fees and expenses include payments to ssgts advisor and third parties acquisition related expenses under gaap are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income loss and income loss from continuing operations both of which are performance measures under gaap all paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors the potential for future distributions and cash flows generated by ssgt unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property in the future if ssgt is not able to raise additional proceeds from its offering this could result in ssgt paying acquisition fees or reimbursing acquisition expenses due to its advisor or a portion thereof with net proceeds from borrowed funds operational earnings or cash flows net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows as a result the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be reduced or ssgt may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed fundsfurther under gaap certain contemplated noncash fair value and other noncash adjustments are considered operating noncash adjustments to net income loss in determining cash flows from operations in addition ssgt views fair value adjustments of derivatives and the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performancessgt uses mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate its performance against other publicly registered nontraded reits which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter as noted above mffo may not be a useful measure of the impact of longterm operating performance if ssgt does not continue to operate in this manner ssgt believes that its use of mffo and the adjustments used to calculate it allow it to present its performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to publicly registered nontraded reits such as their limited life limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy and hence that the use of such measures may be useful to investors for example acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of ssgts offering and other financing sources and not from operations by excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses the use of mffo provides information consistent with managements analysis of the operating performance of the properties additionally fair value adjustments which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates may not be directly related or attributable to ssgts current operating performance by excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses ssgt believes mffo provides useful supplemental informationpresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different reits although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and mffo the same way so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful furthermore ffo and mffo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from continuing operations as an indication of ssgts performance as an alternative to cash flows from operations which is an indication of ssgts liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund ssgts cash needs including its ability to make distributions to its stockholders ffo and mffo should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of ssgts performance mffo may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete neither the sec nareit nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that ssgt uses to calculate ffo or mffo in the future the sec nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered nontraded
