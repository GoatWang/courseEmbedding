of advertising and marketing investments across media platforms as a part of this collaboration nielsen  jdcom will jointly market the mta offering to help marketers better determine the effectiveness

active users along with nielsens digital media monitoring data and analytics expertise the joint offering will help advertisers more efficiently allocate advertising and marketing budgets to increase their roi top company interviews digital media spend now exceeds that of traditional media and the increase in digital marketing investments has brought added complexity consumers are regularly exposed to multiple media touch points across different devices and platforms during the path to purchase making it nearly impossible for marketers to comprehensively measure the effectiveness of their investments until now a typical approach for measuring digital marketing performance has been to attribute a sale to the consumers last advertising exposure or touch point before a purchase though this approach might offer insight into the final steps of a consumers path to purchase it disregards countless previous touch points throughout the online shopping journey the increased fragmentation of online media has created a landscape where consumers are seeing and clicking on hundreds of touch points before they make a purchase for brands who are trying to measure and optimize their online marketing roi this is a massive problem that previous analytics platforms have been unable to solve effectively said vishal bali managing director of nielsen china instead of looking at just that last click before purchase the nielsenjdcom mta offering allows us to track the full online shopping path and then leverage the most effective touch points for better engagement with the consumer yan weipeng vice president of jdcom said under the common goal of maximizing marketing efficiency and sales of manufacturers and brands jds collaboration with nielsen is a winwin solution mta
