covered business crime and local politics for the brooklyn paper and he was the editor of park slope patch he lives in brooklyn new york willyakowicz staff writer incwillyakowicz write a comment actress whoopi goldberg and medical marijuana edibles maker maya elisabeth have teamed up to sell thc edibles geared towards women credit timothy white whoopi goldberg the actress and cohost of daytime talk show the view is launching a new company to sell a centuriesold remedy for womens menstrual pain  marijuana based in san francisco whoopi  maya is positioned as a bywomen forwomen pot edibles business goldberg is teaming with  cannabis grower and edibles maker maya elisabeth herbalist alexis gandara and pot industry pr company founder evan nison on the venture which will begin selling products in marijuana dispensaries in its home city in april i see cannabis as a step in the direction of new forms of medicine but it also has its place in history and goes back to queen victoria goldberg tells inc there are many people trying to get you high were just trying to get you comfortable credit michael osbornecredit timothy whitmichael osborne the companys products which are all infused with thc and medicinal herbs such as elderberry red raspberry leaf and guelderrose include raw sipping cacao for hot chocolate a bath salt soak a body balm for use as a local anesthetic and a tincture to add to liquids or drop under the tongue all of the products were developed specifically to relieve menstrual discomfort only a handful of dispensaries will sell whoopi  maya products at launch but the founders expect to expand to other stores and new regions over the course of the next year it will sell nonpsychoactive versions of its products made with cbd a chemical in cannabis that helps reduce inflammation and acts as an anticonvulsant in states without a legal marijuana market goldberg says she was speaking to her daughter when she came up with the idea for a womanfocused edibles company last year we were trying to figure out a product for menstrual pain that wasnt full of ingredients with names we couldnt pronounce and then it hit me she says she had been using a vape pen with thc oil for her glaucoma but the more research she did the more she read about thc topical rubs and tinctures the founders raised  from friends and family over the last year to launch the company all of the pot comes from an allfemalerun medical marijuana farm in northern california which elisabeth has been involved with since  goldberg says the company is open to expanding its market beyond solely women especially as pot sales become legal in more states and the us dispels what she calls the lie of marijuana being a schedule i drug thats as harmful as harder substances such as heroin eventually whoopi  maya also could look to broaden its product lines to other medicinal applications marijuana is like penicillin goldberg says the amount of things cannabis seems to help is like the amount of things penicillin seems to help    published on mar   interview evan goldberg netsuite  mycustomer marketing technology interview evan goldberg netsuite mycustomer newsdesk share this content th apr   as cto and cofounder of netsuite evan goldberg is driving the product direction for the software as a service saas company goldberg tells mycustomercom about the company history larry ellison saas wars  and why he hopes that saps business bydesign is a good product advertisement by stuart lauchlan news and analysis editor it takes two the most successful hightech firms are often the ones where there are two people at the top albeit only one of whom becomes the public face think of bill gates and paul allen at microsoft larry ellison and bob miner at oracle or the steves  jobs and wozniak  over at apple at netsuite ceo zach nelson has become the front man for the software as a service saas vendor but behind the scenes evan goldberg is driving the product direction for the company as its chief technology officer i hope to some degree that saps business bydesign is a good product so that people can see saas is viable as a model evan goldberg cto netsuitegoldberg is also one of the cofounders of the firm which was set up with financial backing from oracle ceo larry ellison former boss of both goldberg and nelson netsuite was not goldbergs first stop after quitting the database firm “i was doing my own startup dev eloping interactive media technology for websites something similar to what macromedia took over although they didnt exist when we started” he says “after they came along i was thinking about what i wanted to do next “the impetus for what was then called netledger came through the experience of running my own small company of about  people after having been at oracle we had about  different systems to run the business one for every three people we employed we had quickbook yahoo stores customer support done through email an access database that we used for sales and customer management and a few other products to get a list of our customers we could go to five different places and it was never a definitive list of what customers had actually bought it was challenging to get a view of what was actually happening in the business having been at oracle and seen what big firms had at their disposal i knew that they had the tools to track what was going on overall in the business small firms needed the same” high bandwidth conversations netledgers inception was aided by oracles ellison but was born from a remarkably short conversation “larry had been on the side helping me out” explains goldberg “we talked about what i might do next in the course of a five minute conversation – these were high bandwidth conversations  i said that i was interested in looking at how the web could help smaller businesses to work better he said to build something for accounting for small companies and then expand out into areas like sales force automation but start with building on a core of accounting information and customer sales information “the system of record would have to have all the critical data on which you can grow an entire suite of information it would need a centralised database for smaller firms managing and tuning a database like that would be beyond the resources of smaller firms so it would have to be delivered as a hosted service on the web that hosted model has gone through many names since then but larry had been pioneering it with oracle business online this was taking the model to a new market of smaller firms i dont see saas as a limiting factor the infrastructure we deliver netsuite on is worldclass we have a worldclass data centre theres no reason why you cant provide a backbone for a larger company evan goldberg cto netsuite“it was seriously a five minute conversation and then we had our heads down for a year the result was netledger an online accounting offering on the web at the level of quickbooks but all you needed was a browser nine years later we have been building out from that the suite spproach weve taken was a core idea in that first conversation so as soon as we got done with the accounting piece we moved on to order management ecommerce then crm and sfa capabilities in the first five minutes of the companys history we knew that was where we were going to go if everyone in the business was to get a unified view of the business it was the natural outgrowth of our vision” to date netsuite has focused on the sme space seemingly adding fuel to the criticism in some quarters that saas is only appropriate for smaller firms goldberg disputes this “i dont see saas as a limiting factor” he says “in a lot of ways the limiting factor is infrastructure the infrastructure we deliver netsuite on is worldclass we have a worldclass data centre with that theres no reason why you cant provide a backbone for a larger company its more about the application itself midsized companies get to the level where theyre using a sage application but their business is becoming more complex and growing they need more unified business processes that go across the entire organisation we can scale very well within that target” saas wars in recent months startups like netsuite and salesforcecom have been joined by traditional enterprise applications vendors such as sap and microsoft in pitching into the saas market but goldberg does not regard this new competition as necessarily a safer bet for customers “version  of a product is not necessarily going to be safer than one thats been out for nine years” he argues “but sap and microsoft will legitimise the saas model for running the business they will get a lot more eyeballs looking at saas as alternative to the traditional model so from that point of view its a positive move sap and microsoft will legitimise the saas model for running the business they will get a lot more eyeballs looking at saas as alternative to the traditional model evan goldberg cto netsuite“when db from ibm came out the big fear at oracle was not that db was coming out but that it might not be any good and turn people off relational databases so i hope to some degree that saps business bydesign is a good product so that people can see saas is viable as a model the next stage is to recognise that the suite approach is viable when ceos see our ceos dashboard they think its the best thing since sliced bread once they get that its possible then you come down to looking at actual products references customisation and so on these are not impulse purchases” so will the saas wars of the st century be akin to the oracle v ingres database wars of the s “oracle and ingres were doing very similar things so you were comparing apples to apples” suggests goldberg “netsuite and salesforcecom are doing different things which are both legitimate they are delivering a narrow application of sales force automation to the widest range of companies from small to large we are delivering an application for a broader set of core processes so the head to head aspect of the database wars is not really there” quantitative and logical larry last year netsuite went public an event which put the spotlight back on larry ellisons majority holding in the firm although the oracle boss does not play as active a role as it might be assumed he does “larry has been involved from the very beginning and he has been the catalyst” explains goldberg “subsequently that involvement has not been as intensive perhaps but he has been incredibly helpful he has a very objective way of approaching business problems hes a great supporter of the dashboard approach to make sure you have all the information you need to make decisions he has a very quantitative and logical way of looking at business problems what i find exciting about the future is the notion that you have this great juggernaut of information out there so that you can give business owners more than just data and charts evan goldberg cto netsuite“what i find exciting about the future is the notion that you have this great juggernaut of information out there so that you can give business owners more than just data and charts its the eternal dilemma of the computer in general – theres always more that you can do you want some intelligence about how you use data to get ahead of the curve one of the things im most excited about is the upsell manager because we have all the purchase information whatever channel your product has been sold through we can trawl patterns that can help you to sell better if you have products with a high margin and can identify why customer a has bought them and not customer b then you can target customers better the ones who havent bought could be good ones to call you might call it operational analytics but if we can provide intelligent assistance to the business owner then thats exciting” related articles special report netsuite puts hairballs in the cloud netsuite ceo slams sap and outlines successful saas drivers special report netsuite enters
