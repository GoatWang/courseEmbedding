between organizations and their employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in may  equinix completed the purchase of  verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across  markets in the us and latin america the company offers colocation interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises content companies systems integrators and  network service providers worldwide equinix data centers host more than  cloud and it service providers equinix offers several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality and internet exchange the name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity” equinix reports  employees globally and is listed on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol eqix equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may

employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in

several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality and internet exchange the name is pronounced

equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened

recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by

center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in

to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may  extended equinix’s north american footprint into two new markets houston and culpeper va and expanded its latin american presence by adding a facility in sao paulo and bringing the company into bogota colombia for the first time the company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform as houston is an energy industry center culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in latin america the deal also included more than  verizon customers more than  of whom were new to equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us experienced relatively limited outages compared to widespread problems at other vendors equinix has received various international standards compliance iso certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers they include iso  iec  and  information security management system standard related to information and physical security and business continuity and the pcidss payment card industry data security standard related to physical security access to customer equipment cloudedit equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus in a  interview smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can” the equinix cloud exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its ibx data centers it believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market as of the end of  equinix hosted more than  cloud providers some analysts have warned that longterm consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as equinix equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of clouddependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on enterpriseedit equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses in a  conference smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at  globally and projected equinix could land as many as  enterprise customers by  equinix’s total customer base at the end of  was about  including about  enterprise customers industry observers said a challenge for equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what equinix offers “courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving equinix’s traditional customer base consisting of financial network media and cloud companies these customers basically knew what they wanted from equinix and all equinix had to do was deliver” equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business it argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network” the company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise named the interconnection oriented architecture this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon thirdparty colocation providers like equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale in response equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and businesscritical applications the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multicloud strategies will further establish equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers ecosystemsedit equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles company managers said they began noticing in the early s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform it has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the equinix platform the ecosystems inside equinix include cloud network financial services content and media online advertising sustainabilityedit equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform in  the company made a longterm pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy the pledge followed criticism in  from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation the following year equinix pledged to use  clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in texas and oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire north american data center portfolio equinix said that as a leader in an energyintensive industry it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms” in a  update to its  report greenpeace said equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its  renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet” also in  equinix was also among the signatories of the white house’s american business act on climate pledge as part of the pledge signed in the runup to the  paris agreement on slowing climate change dozens of us corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals data center ibx locationsedit americas country data centers

interconnection between organizations and their employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in may  equinix completed the purchase of  verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across  markets in the us and latin america the company offers colocation interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises content companies systems integrators and  network service providers worldwide equinix data centers host more than  cloud and it service providers equinix offers several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality

exchange under the ticker symbol eqix equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which

regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city

continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may  extended equinix’s north american footprint into two new markets houston and culpeper va and expanded its latin american presence by adding a facility in sao paulo and bringing the company into bogota colombia for the first time the company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform as houston is an energy industry center culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in latin america the deal also included more than  verizon customers more than  of whom were new to equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us experienced relatively limited outages compared to widespread problems at other vendors equinix has received various international standards compliance iso certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers they include iso  iec  and  information security management system standard related to information and physical security and business continuity and the pcidss payment card industry data security standard related to physical security access to customer equipment cloudedit equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus in a  interview smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can” the equinix cloud exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its ibx data centers it believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market as of the end of  equinix hosted more than  cloud providers some analysts have warned that longterm consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as equinix equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of clouddependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on enterpriseedit equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses in a  conference smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at  globally and projected equinix could land as many as  enterprise customers by  equinix’s total customer base at the end of  was about  including about  enterprise customers industry observers said a challenge for equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what equinix offers “courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving equinix’s traditional customer base consisting of financial network media and cloud companies these customers basically knew what they wanted from equinix and all equinix had to do was deliver” equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business it argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network” the company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise named the interconnection oriented architecture this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon thirdparty colocation providers like equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale in response equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and businesscritical applications the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multicloud strategies will further establish equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers ecosystemsedit equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles company managers said they began noticing in the early s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform it has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the equinix platform the ecosystems inside equinix include cloud network financial services content and media online advertising sustainabilityedit equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform in  the company made a longterm pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy the pledge followed criticism in  from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation the following year equinix pledged to use  clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in texas and oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire north american data center portfolio equinix said that as a leader in an energyintensive industry it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms” in a  update to its  report greenpeace said equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its  renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet” also in  equinix was also among the signatories of the white house’s american business act on climate pledge as part of the pledge signed in the runup to the  paris agreement on slowing climate

equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us experienced relatively limited outages compared to widespread problems at other vendors equinix has received various international standards compliance iso certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers they include iso  iec  and  information security management system standard related to information and physical security and business continuity and the pcidss payment card industry data security standard related to physical security access to customer equipment cloudedit equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus in a  interview smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can” the equinix cloud exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its ibx data centers it believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market as of the end of  equinix hosted more than  cloud providers some analysts have warned that longterm consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as equinix equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of clouddependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on enterpriseedit equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses in a  conference smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at  globally and projected equinix could land as many as  enterprise customers by  equinix’s total customer base at the end of  was about  including about  enterprise customers industry observers said a challenge for equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what equinix offers “courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving equinix’s traditional customer base consisting of financial network media and cloud companies these customers basically knew what they wanted from equinix and all equinix had to do was deliver” equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business it argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network” the company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise named the interconnection oriented architecture this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon thirdparty colocation providers like equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale in response equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and businesscritical applications the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multicloud strategies will further establish equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers ecosystemsedit equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles company managers said they began noticing in the early s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform it has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the equinix platform the ecosystems inside equinix include cloud network financial services content and media online advertising sustainabilityedit equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform in  the company made a longterm pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy the pledge followed criticism in  from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation the following year equinix pledged to use  clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in texas and oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire north american data center portfolio equinix said that as a leader in an energyintensive industry it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms” in a  update to its  report greenpeace said equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its  renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet” also in  equinix was also among the signatories of the white house’s american business act on climate pledge as part of the pledge signed in the runup to the  paris agreement on slowing climate change dozens of us corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals data center ibx locationsedit americas country data centers

multinational company headquartered in redwood city california that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in may  equinix completed the purchase of  verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across  markets in the us and latin america the company offers colocation interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises content companies systems integrators and  network service providers worldwide equinix data centers host more than  cloud and it service providers equinix offers several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality and internet exchange the name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity” equinix reports  employees globally and is listed on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol eqix equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may  extended equinix’s north american footprint into two new markets houston and culpeper va and expanded its latin american presence by adding a facility in sao paulo and bringing the company into bogota colombia for the first time the company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform as houston is an energy industry center culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in latin america the deal also included more than  verizon customers more than  of whom were new to equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us experienced relatively limited outages compared to widespread problems at other vendors equinix has received various international standards compliance iso certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers they include iso  iec  and  information security management system standard related to information and physical security and business continuity and the pcidss payment card industry data security standard related to physical security access to customer equipment cloudedit equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus in a  interview smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can” the equinix cloud exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its ibx data centers it believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market as of the end of  equinix hosted more than  cloud providers some analysts have warned that longterm consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as equinix equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of clouddependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on enterpriseedit equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses in a  conference smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at  globally and projected equinix could land as many as  enterprise customers by  equinix’s total customer base at the end of  was about  including about  enterprise customers industry observers said a challenge for equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what equinix offers “courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving equinix’s traditional customer base consisting of financial network media and cloud companies these customers basically knew what they wanted from equinix and all equinix had to do was deliver” equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business it argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network” the company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise named the interconnection oriented architecture this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon thirdparty colocation providers like equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale in response equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and businesscritical applications the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multicloud strategies will further establish equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers ecosystemsedit equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles company managers said they began noticing in the early s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform it has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the equinix platform the ecosystems inside equinix include cloud network financial services content and media online advertising sustainabilityedit equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform in  the company made a longterm pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy the pledge followed criticism in  from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation the following year equinix pledged to use  clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in texas and oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire north american data center portfolio equinix said that as a leader in an energyintensive industry it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms” in a  update to its  report greenpeace said equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its  renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet” also in  equinix was also among the signatories of the white house’s american business act on climate pledge as part of the pledge signed in the runup to the  paris agreement on slowing climate change dozens of us corporations made commitments to a range

multinational company headquartered in redwood city california that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in may  equinix completed the purchase of  verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across  markets in the us and latin america the company offers colocation interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises content companies systems integrators and  network service providers worldwide equinix data centers host more than  cloud and it service providers equinix offers several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality and internet exchange the name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity” equinix reports  employees globally and is listed on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol eqix equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may  extended equinix’s north american footprint into two new markets houston and culpeper va and expanded its latin american presence by adding a facility in sao paulo and bringing the company into bogota colombia for the first time the company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform as houston is an energy industry center culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in latin america the deal also included more than  verizon customers more than  of whom were new to equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us

employees customers partners data and clouds the company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share and it operates  data centers in  major metropolitan areas in  countries on five continents equinix was founded in  to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic it expanded to asiapacific in  and europe in  the company later began operating facilities in latin america in  and in the middle east in  its purchase of telecitygroup in early  established the company as the largest colocation provider in europe in may  equinix completed the purchase of  verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across  markets in the us and latin america the company offers colocation interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises content companies systems integrators and  network service providers worldwide equinix data centers host more than  cloud and it service providers equinix offers several interconnection services including equinix cross connects equinix performance hub and equinix data hub the company operates the equinix cloud exchange and an internet exchange its professional services group offers various consulting and technical support services equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide which the company claims results in superior connectivity its global data center platform which it calls platform equinix is one of three components of a tripleringed “moat” the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors it says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence the name equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes equality neutrality and internet exchange the name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity” equinix reports  employees globally and is listed on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol eqix equinix reported  revenues of  billion contents  history  expansion  data centers  cloud  enterprise  ecosystems  sustainability  data center ibx locations  see also  references  external links historyedit equinix was founded in  by al avery and jay adelson two facilities managers at digital equipment corporation the founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth in an interview adelson recalled that the early internet was run by cowboys … it just wasnt hardened it wasnt commercialized and for those of us that cared we knew that a company like equinix would need to exist somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic this peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach regionally and globally and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet the “network of networks” equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception as it aimed to capitalize on the socalled “network effect” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform each new carrier for example would expand network route options for content providers who were then increasingly drawn to equinix and in turn increased equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers in an early interview an equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people” the company’s first data centers opened in new york city silicon valley and the washington dc area soon after the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand expansionedit equinix’s overseas expansion began in  in asiapacific after it acquired data centers in hong kong singapore sydney and tokyo in mergers with istt and pihana pacific steve smith took over as ceo in  the same year equinix announced a  billion international expansion plan and entered the european market by acquiring data center operator ixeurope and its facilities in france germany the netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that plan was completed with the  opening of equinix’s th global data center in london but a more intense period of growth followed over the next seven years the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing along with the expansion of related trends such as the internet of things and big data equinix’s next major acquisition came in  when the company purchased switch and data facilities company inc a us internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in  north american markets the transaction was valued at approximately  million the company extended its operations to the middle east and in southeast asia in  announcing partnerships to enter the dubai uae and jakarta indonesia markets also in  equinix increased its commitment to asiapacific its fastestgrowing region by completing a  million allcash transaction for hong kongbased data center provider asiatone in the transaction equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the hong kong shanghai and singapore markets at the time of the deal smith said the acquisition put equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in asiapacific in  equinix strengthened its latin american presence when it paid  million to complete the acquisition of alog datacenters of brazil sa the country’s leading provider of carrierneutral data centers equinix had acquired a  stake in alog in  in  equinix converted to a real estate investment trust reit in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend in addition equinix acquired the professional services company nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies the year  was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for equinix early in the year equinix opened five new data centers on four continents increasing the companys data center footprint to more than  million square feet the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may  when equinix said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for  million in january  equinix announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately  billion the addition of telecitygroup’s  data centers more than doubled equinix’s capacity in europe making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider the deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core it design principle and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation the size of the deal raised questions about equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term smith responded to the questions by noting equinix ‘s strong balance sheet this deal doesnt preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities he said four months after smith’s comment in september  equinix said it would buy japanese provider bitisle for  million the deal finalized in december  doubled the number of equinix data centers in japan to  by adding five in tokyo and one in osaka it also established equinix as japan’s fourthlargest data center provider in  equinix opened new data centers in dallas sydney and tokyo and announced a deal to acquire  data centers in  markets from verizon for  billion the purchase which closed in may  extended equinix’s north american footprint into two new markets houston and culpeper va and expanded its latin american presence by adding a facility in sao paulo and bringing the company into bogota colombia for the first time the company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform as houston is an energy industry center culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in latin america the deal also included more than  verizon customers more than  of whom were new to equinix many were from the enterprise market which equinix has aggressively targeted in  equinix also opened a new data center in sao paulo smith frequently speaks of his goal to build equinix into an “historically significant” company he points to equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion saying it aligns with clouddriven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services equinix provides “equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world” he said data centersedit equinix has invested more than  billion since its founding to build its data center platform equinix calls its data centers international business exchanges ibxs to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable chairman peter van camp has compared them to international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations smith said the interconnection available within his companys broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute it closer to employees customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves we spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it equinix ibxs peer ip traffic to over  of the worlds internet routes their internet exchanges route internet traffic between more than  telecommunications networks worldwide the company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in  after its customers in the northeast us experienced relatively limited outages compared to widespread problems at other vendors equinix has received various international standards compliance iso certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers they include iso  iec  and  information security management system standard related to information and physical security and business continuity and the pcidss payment card industry data security standard related to physical security access to customer equipment cloudedit equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus in a  interview smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can” the equinix cloud exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its ibx data centers it believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market as of the end of  equinix hosted more than  cloud providers some analysts have warned that longterm consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as equinix equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of clouddependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on enterpriseedit equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses in a  conference smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at  globally and projected equinix could land as many as  enterprise customers by  equinix’s total customer base at the end of  was about  including about  enterprise customers industry observers said a challenge for equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what equinix offers “courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving equinix’s traditional customer base consisting of financial network media and cloud companies these customers basically knew what they wanted from equinix and all equinix had to do was deliver” equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business it argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network” the company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise named the interconnection oriented architecture this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon thirdparty colocation providers like equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale in response equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and businesscritical applications the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multicloud strategies will further establish equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers ecosystemsedit equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles company managers said they began noticing in the early s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform it has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the equinix platform the ecosystems inside equinix include cloud network financial services content and media online advertising sustainabilityedit equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform in  the company made a longterm pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy the pledge followed criticism in  from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation the following year equinix pledged to use  clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in texas and oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire north american data center

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
