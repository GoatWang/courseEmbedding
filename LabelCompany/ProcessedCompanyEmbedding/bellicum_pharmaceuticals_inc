bellicum pharmaceuticals inc vs kite pharma is bellicum pharmaceuticals or kite pharma the better adoptive tcell therapy stock to buy george budwell tmfgbudwell mar   at am the next shoe is set to drop in the highflying immunooncology space with genetically modified cell therapies close to becoming a reality as these therapies are forecast to quickly become one of the fastestgrowing segments of the  billion oncology market in the next few years investors may want to consider taking a position in this emerging field before the first therapy reaches the market  armed with this insight lets consider if the smallcap bellicum pharmaceuticals nasdaqblcm or the midcap kite pharma nasdaqkite is the better adoptivecell therapy stock to buy   image source getty images bellicum is a promising smallcap immunotherapy company bellicum is a smallcap biotech developing a host of genetically modified cellbased therapies for blood disorders and various cancers while cellbased immunotherapies are now a common feature of many pharma pipelines bellicum stands apart from the crowd because of its proprietary chemical induction of dimerization cid technology thats designed to enhance the safety and efficacy profiles of these novel cancerfighting cell therapies specifically the biotechs cellular therapies incorporate a molecular switching mechanism that can be triggered by a small molecule known as rimiducid to either induce programmed cell death apoptosis in the event of a safety issue or cause the infused cells to proliferate to enhance potency  using its cid platform bellicum designed its lead tcell therapy product candidate bpx to improve patient outcomes during a halfmatched tdepleted hematopoietic stemcell transplantation hsct  a process that involves the intravenous infusion of stem cells as a way to restart the production of blood cells in patients with bonemarrow or immunesystem disorders although halfmatched hsct can be lifesaving in many instances this procedure does have serious lifethreatening drawbacks such as graftversushostdisease gvhd or an increased risk of infection from the eradication of tcells before infusion bpxs builtin safety switch however should solve this problem by lowering the risk of uncontrolled bouts of gvhd while still allowing patients to benefit from a higher tcell count the good news is that the therapys earlystage results across a range of rare blood disorders are proving to be a game changer for many hsct patients as such bellicum is hoping to file for bpxs first regulatory approval in the eu by mid and nail down an acceptable regulatory pathway for the therapy in the us by the middle of this year the downside though is that the biotechs cash runway probably isnt sufficient to see it all the way through to bpxs worldwide commercialization bellicum after all has around  million remaining in cash following its latest secondary offering but it also has a quarterly burn rate of around  million thats bound to grow as its clinical activities expand into latestage development  kite pharma may gain the allimportant firstmover advantage soon after a quartercentury of development of adoptive tcell therapies in general kite pharma is now in prime position to bring the first chimeric antigen receptor tcell or cart therapy to market with its experimental aggressive nonhodgkin lymphoma nhl treatment called axicel formerly ktec at the time of writing kite was expected to wrap up axicels full regulatory filing with the fda within just a matter of days before the end of march putting it well ahead of novartis and juno therapeutics rival cart candidates the point is that kite is set to be the first company to establish a foothold in a brandnew oncology market that should easily be worth hundreds of billions in sales over the next decade moreover axicels first indication isnt a token one if approved as a laterline treatment for aggressive nhl this novel cell therapy is expected to haul in between  million and  million in  depending on its price and the scale of kites initial commercial launch   having said that kite is far from a slamdunk buy like all other cart therapies to date axicel does have serious lifethreatening side effects including cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity and this therapy lacks a topflight molecular safety switch so while its overall riskvsreward profile may warrant an approval theres no telling how doctors will view the therapys clearcut tradeoffs in the real world  kite must also overcome the inherent problems associated with manufacturing an adoptive tcell therapy on a commercial scale put simply you have to be able to harvest a patients own tcells ship them to your production facility to genetically modify them and then ship them back to the clinic where the patient is being treated thats not an impossible feat to overcome but its also a far cry from simply brewing a batch of pills or even manufacturing most other biologicalbased drugs  on the bright side kite is in a fairly strong financial position exiting the most recent quarter with over  million in cash and no debt and thats before the company rolled out a  million public stock offering in the first quarter of  so the company should have the resources to execute axicels commercial launch if it gains an approval later this year as well as continue advancing its other clinical candidates  which stock is the better buy while kites possible firstmover advantage is certainly important bellicum appears to have the bestinclass technology with its cid platform and thats absolutely key the underlying reason adoptivecell therapies took so long to move from the bench to the market is their deadly side effects kite for its part has been able to reduce these lifethreatening side effects to manageable levels in the clinic but thats not a guarantee this line will hold once axicel is used more broadly juno therapeutics lead clinical candidate jcar after all was ultimately shelved after it apparently led to a handful of deaths in a trial for adult patients with relapsed or refractory bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and thats been par for the course with these therapies in other words history is not on kites side when it comes to the current generation of cart therapies  so bellicums nextgeneration adoptivecell therapy product candidates  along with juno and kites for that matter  that incorporate more robust safety features are probably the way to go if youre looking to invest in this emerging space point blank this rush to market for a technology with known safety issues is a highly questionable strategy that has the potential to backfire in a big way  in all bellicum comes out the winner in this match because of its patience and better longterm prospects from a safety standpoint   george budwell has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends juno therapeutics the motley fool has a disclosure policy author

pharmaceuticals inc vs bluebird bio inc several of the most interesting drugs in development belong to bellicum and bluebird bio but which is the better stock pick right now cory renauer tmfangapples mar   at am bellicum pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqblcm and bluebird bio inc nasdaqblue occupy an interesting corner of the biotech industry both clinicalstage biotechs are developing cellular therapies for the treatment of blood disorders and cancer neither has an approved product to sell although candidates winding their way through development stages could generate billions lets see how the potential new therapies they have in development measure up to see which of these stocks is the better pick at the moment image source getty images bellicum pharmaceuticals inc under control bellicums lead candidate bpx is a novel solution to a common problem stemcell transplants can effectively treat a range of bloodbased diseases but using donor cells from a lessthanperfect match is so dangerous that the procedure is severely limited the most lethal complication that arises when transplanting stem cells from less than perfectly matched donors is graftversushost disease gvhd an immunesystem attack on donor stem cells recipients typically undergo immunecell depletion ahead of transplants to avoid gvhd which presents complications of its own bellicums candidate involves modifying donor immune cells with a kill switch that healthcare providers can activate with simple administration of rimiducid in an ongoing trial with  pediatric patients receiving partially matched donor stemcell transplants five cases of uncontrolled gvhd were resolved by activating the shutoff switch bellicum has also begun human trials with bpx for the treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancer a disease with tremendous unmet need the candidate involves modifying immune cells to attack tumors expressing a specific target on their surfaces there are a handful of biotechs advancing chimeric antigen receptor modified tcells cart through clinical trials but bpx has a unique safety switch similar to bpx image source getty images bellicums controllable cart technology could become all the rage these experimental therapies have shown an ability to help patients who had failed numerous lines of treatment with existing drugs however some have proven too effective rapid cancercell destruction has been linked to severe sometimes fatal side effects bluebird bio inc another approach bluebird bios lead candidate could eventually compete with bellicums for patients with transfusiondependent betathalassemia and severe sickle disease two inherited disorders caused by faulty hemoglobin genes bluebirds lentiglobin involves reintroducing a patients own stem cells after theyve been modified to produce functional hemoglobin perfectly matched stem cells present very little risk of gvhd which could render bellicums lead candidate redundant if approved annual lentiglobin sales could eventually peak at around  billion for the treatment of betathalassemia and  billion in the larger sicklecell indication that makes it the companys most important clinicalstage asset but its not the only one with ninefigure annual sales potential bluebird also boasts a cart candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma called bb that could go on to generate about  billion in annual sales at its peak last december bluebird presented interim data from a small trial with patients who had relapsed following between five and  previous lines of treatment despite being so heavily pretreated seven of nine evaluable patients disease showed a response about a year ago celgene exercised an option to develop and possibly commercialize bb and remarkable data suggests the big biotech made a smart decision the agreement removes a great deal of risk for bluebird while leaving it eligible for hefty milestone and royalty payments if it succeeds the better buy lentiglobin and bpx are deep in uncharted waters and cart therapies are still experimental across the board while the combination of safety and efficacy weve seen so far is highly encouraging investors in either company need to brace themselves for regulatory uncertainty should any or all of these biotechs candidates earn approvals their commercial viability is another big question mark cellularbased therapies present enormous challenges for patients and healthcare providers that you just dont see with simple pills or injections with a market cap of about  billion bluebird stock has a long way to fall if it runs into any surprise potholes on the way to profit town should disaster strike bellicum has a much lower perch to fall from with a recent market cap of just  million in fact the smaller companys stock is so cheap that i think it underestimates the safety switch technologys longterm potential and makes the company a potential acquisition target add it all up and bellicum pharmaceuticals looks the

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

never as well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life against whatever odds they face together now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor the best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and its coming faster than we can imagine welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the
