october  which was not repeated in the current quarter peter r chase chairman and chief executive officer commented we had a solid start to the  fiscal year with momentum carrying over from the end of last year when we subtract from the fiscal  numbers the onetime pretax gain on the sale of a product line of  million in october  income increased substantially in the quarter ending november   the quality of the revenue also improved with operating income up  over the previous first quarter this speaks to the continued effort to reduce fixed manufacturing overhead through ongoing facilities consolidation stable raw material costs and a focus on the marketing of higher margin products adam p chase president and chief operating officer added in the industrial materials segment humiseal coatings and cover tapes for the electronic industry had demand increases led by automotive applications pulling and detection tapes were also strong with renewed infrastructure work to support bandwidth expansion wire  cable products were steady and sales of durable paper products were weaker in the quarter the construction materials segment is having success with pipeline coatings for water infrastructure projects in the middle east while gas and oil pipeline product demand in the us has slowed municipal infrastructure coatings in architectural and building envelope applications showed positive growth bridge  highway product sales have been down for the last nine months due to project postponements and cancellations stemming from the severe winter weather a year ago peter r

schedule this was a substantial effort and implemented almost entirely by internal staff as we move ahead we see both challenges and opportunities with the volatility in crude oil prices our next quarter is traditionally our lowest performer due to loss of construction projects in the winter months but we will work hard to maximize results i am looking forward to my role in the new leadership
