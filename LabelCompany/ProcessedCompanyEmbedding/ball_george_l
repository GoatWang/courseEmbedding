sicom nba lonzo the lakers and an la dream come true   nba the lonzo and lavar ball strategy quickly a hometown product is about to breathe new life into the lakers how long until another la native joins him lonzo balls laker dreams are coming true—will paul georges soon follow share twitter lee jenkins friday june rd  los angeles — this is an la basketball story in march  ucla lost in the opening round of the pac tournament to washington and after the game head coach ben howland took his staff to a revolving restaurant on the top floor of the holiday inn the bruins had gone  in howland’s first season and his assistants were obviously anxious howland was not known for dramatic gestures but at one point during the dinner he stood up and faced the window looking out over interstate  it was  pm and traffic was at a standstill “we’re going to be just fine” howland said “and do you know why because there are people out there a lot of people” among those natives who care about hoops many grow up wanting to play for ucla all grow up wanting to play for the lakers  over the next several years la and its suburban sprawl cranked out russell westbrook and james harden paul george and kawhi leonard klay thompson and demar derozan a stunning constellation of stars howland was replaced by steve alford and the holiday inn by the hotel angeleno the city’s talent pool dipped and then rose again led by a telepathic point guard from chino hills who was  when he started throwing alleyoops to highschool kids and playing ymca games against adults lonzo ball enrolled at ucla last fall and by january general managers were saying he’d be one of the top two prospects drafted the lakers then looking like upstarts seemed to have no chance at him but ball’s friends and family kept following the hometown team silently celebrating every secondhalf loss each one inching their beloved baller closer to staples center nba  nba draft grades best and worst picks ​ like lebron james in ’ and derrick rose in ’ ball was destined to stay local an oversized floor general joining a team run by magic johnson and coached by luke walton at the finals warriors staffers wondered who the lakers would tab with the no  pick but they knew exactly who would fit best in the system steve kerr implemented and walton studied other candidates had more quickness and athleticism “lonzo” one of the dubs coaches said “has the feel” the lakers did not get distracted by ball’s outrageous father or his exorbitant footwear they focused on that feel “we hope that by the way he plays” walton said thursday night “everybody else on our team becomes better” jesse d garrabrantgetty images ​ some standouts prefer to get away from home escaping all the ticket requests and dinner invitations but lavar ball instructed his eldest son long ago to accept those burdens and consider the benefits “when things aren’t going your way you’re still somewhere you want to be” lavar told lonzo before he committed to ucla “you can always just come back up the freeway and reboot” lonzo does not follow his father’s lead in every area—“i don’t think i say anything too crazy” he muses—but he embraced that bit of advice “i always play for my hometown” lonzo said which brings us to another one of those prized southland products the lakers have always been able to attract talent with tradition sunshine and commercial opportunities but they now seem to be exploiting their significant homecourt advantage with the current generation pacers star paul george in a style more understated than lavar’s has made clear that he too wants to be back in la when he becomes a free agent in  after jimmy butler was traded from chicago to minnesota on thursday george became the specter hovering over draft night while other teams debated how many assets to surrender for a superstar who might leave anyway the lakers wrestled with the opposite issue how many assets to yield for a player who might sign anyway nba  nba draft grades pickbypick analysis ​ if the lakers do not acquire george this summer even as a preemptive strike they are going to struggle badly again next season ball will elevate the group as walton expects but he needs shooters around him and la just parted with its two most prolific snipers nick young who opted to become a free agent and d’angelo russell who was sent to brooklyn as the chaser for timofey mozgov’s contract the lakers have cited russell’s immaturity but he is only  and he was picked second two years ago pushed out of his point guard spot russell might have faltered but he also might have flourished as a shooter and playmaker off the ball jesse d garrabrantgetty images the lakers did not take the time to find out throwing their chips on ball and brandon ingram plus one blank space they hope will be occupied by george and another they dream will be taken by lebron james of course james is from akron not la but he summers in brentwood so home court is again a factor before any longterm decisions are made though potential free agents will want to get a glimpse of ball no sooner had he been chosen friday and his father was already making playoff guarantees followed by a twitter plea from ers center joel embiid for power forward ben simmons to “dunk on him so hard that his daddy runs on the court to save him”                  ball is used to the bullseye as is his new coach in  every lakers veteran was allowed to coopt a rookie and they all wanted walton because they were angry about comments his father once made on tv competition was so fierce they held an auction with karl malone bidding  edging shaquille o’neal “i had a target on my back from my dad” walton said “and it worked out” once the mailman met luke he realized he couldn’t haze him nba trade grades wolves fleece bulls in jimmy butler blockbuster ​​ if anyone can temper lavar for his son’s sake it might be magic johnson la’s biggest baller of all magic’s scouting acumen may be unknown but his gravity and charm are legend he will have much wisdom to share with lonzo another fastbreak maestro and perhaps some for lavar as well how lonzo plays—pushing pace finding cutters launching awkward but accurate threes—is no mystery how lavar responds is anybody’s guess “it’s going to be a surprise to you and me” lonzo said              his la basketball story from chino to westwood to the lakers could be a fairy tale or a reality show so far it’s unfolding as he wanted where he planned   tags lonzo ball lonzo ball lakers lavar ball magic johnson nba draft  nba draft
