obituary all sections obituaries valerie hunter gordon inventor of the disposable nappy – obituary valerie hunter gordon credit peter jolly northpix valerie hunter gordon who has died aged  helped to deliver mothers from the daily drudgery of mangle washing line and ironing board by inventing the first disposable nappy system in  valerie the wife of an army officer was living in camberley surrey and expecting her third child she was not looking forward to the prospect of washing ironing and drying the traditional towelling nappies which were all that were available at the time  “i just didn’t want to wash them” she told an interviewer last year “you had to iron them as well it was awful labour i was amazed you couldn’t buy a disposable version i enquired of the us and you couldn’t buy them there it was extraordinary”  so she decided she had better do something about it herself  valerie hunter gordon with her daughter frances after a certain amount of trial and error initially she used old nylon parachutes of which there were many spare after the war and drawing on her considerable needlework skills she came up with a pair of adjustable pvc waterproof pants fastened with poppers with a cord around the waist which could be wiped clean or washed and bleached into these she slipped a pad of cellulose wadding with a thin layer of cotton wool next to the baby’s skin to prevent soreness the waterproof pants prevented leakage and were shaped to ensure that the pad remained in position without safety pins unlike modern allinone disposable nappies valerie’s design meant that only the biodegradable dirty pads were disposed of while the waterproof pants could be rinsed and used again this  system created very little permanent waste it also significantly reduced the water and electricity consumption associated with washing cotton nappies  design for the paddi nappy credit universal news europe the nappies were a huge success on her baby son nigel and she soon began taking orders from the wives of other senior officers at staff college in camberley “my husband used to cut out the pads on the floor of the attic when he came home from work and i used to run them up with my mother’s old sewing machine i would go out for tea with the wives and babies and they would say oh valerie wouldn’t you make one for me’ it became a fulltime job it was more hard work than washing the damn things”   the old singer sewing machine remained in regular use in her children’s nursery until the final years of her life of the prepvc prototypes valerie ended up making some  pairs of plastic pants in her kitchen from parachute nylon and other experimental materials and selling them for five shillings each in  she and her husband applied for a patent a breakthrough came when valerie hunter gordon’s father sir vincent de ferranti met sir robert robinson a director of robinsons of chesterfield manufacturer of oldfashioned women’s sanitary belts and told him about his daughter’s invention  in  when the family moved to invernessshire robinsons agreed to start manufacturing the nappies the pants were patented as a “paddi” while the “paddi pad” throwaway inserts were made a registered design an early advertisement for the paddi credit peter jollynorthpix they were not an immediate success in the frugal postwar years many women found the disposable element of the paddi wasteful and extravagant but the idea began to catch on and the product was featured in the ideal home exhibition in   the bbc then featured the paddi as one of the six most innovative items of the year and by the end of that year  packs had been sold by  sales had reached six million and the royalties contributed to the hunter gordons’  increasing household expenditure they went on to have three more children valerie hunter gordon travelled up and down the country to the robinsons headquarters in chesterfield finetuning designs for paddi and later on designing other products including a similar product for women the nikini with “nikini pads” based on the paddi concept rather to her surprise the nikini earned more royalties overall than the paddi though as she reflected “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies” the paddi brand went into decline in the s with the arrival of proctor and gamble’s allinone disposable nappy pampers robinsons fought back with paddi cosifits but were unable to unable to invest sufficiently in marketing to compete with the american product while the paddi’s pvc pants could be reused the pads were disposable so few examples of the product in their unused pristine form still exist the va possesses a pack “found in the donor’s mother’s attic” observing that “due to their ephemeral nature they are quite rare” valerie hunter gordon with her children from left to right alison nigel and hugh credit universal news europe valerie ziani de ferranti was born at baslow derbyshire on december   the daughter of sir vincent de ferranti and dorothy hettie wilson her grandfather the inventor sebastian de ferranti was the founder of the eponymous family electrical engineering company she attended the convent of the sacred heart woldingham and in  married patrick hunter gordon then a lieutenant in the royal engineers who had won an mc earlier in the year after blowing up a bridge under heavy gunfire during the retreat to dunkirk he suffered posttraumatic illness and valerie hunter gordon unflaggingly supported him over years of investigation and treatment shielding her children from crises and developing her products all the while  she was lunching with lord lovat when he joked that her two daughters in identical tartan dresses looked like sponge bags in  she designed the family’s hitech house in invernessshire it featured electric selfclosing curtains and sophisticated heating systems she constructed a magnificent garden and would do the weeding in an old raincoat she referred to as her “mink” valerie hunter gordon was rarely satisfied with things as they were she liked to make improvements she did not believe for example that you could only have one scottish tartan she was lunching with lord lovat one day when he joked that her two daughters dressed in identical gordon tartan dresses looked like sponge bags  determined to find an alternative pattern she consulted the thread count registers collected by the highland society in the th century and reconstructed another tartan that was recorded as having been created by gordon weavers a lively pattern with shades of pink red green and black it became one of the most popular gordon tartans worldwide marketed as red gordon patrick hunter gordon died in a car accident in  valerie hunter gordon is survived by their

wednesday  november   est valerie hunter gordon who has died aged  designed the world’s first disposable nappy initially in  using nylon from old wartime parachutes awaiting the birth of her third child she dreaded what she called the “awful labour” of washing drying and ironing cloth nappies surprised there was no alternative she determined to invent one the result was a twopart system the paddi an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable biodegradable pad made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool she received a patent for the invention in october  the first  she made at her kitchen table with a singer sewing machine selling them to friends for five shillings apiece boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in  after a lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes seventytwo thousand of them sold in  then in   by  the number was m the american company procter  gamble began producing the allinone pampers from  which though not biodegradable were cheaper the paddi entered a slow decline in sales the last rolling of the assembly line in  hunter gordon’s subsequent inventions included the nikini one of the first modern sanitary towels in  and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour rather than ironing she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet tiring of polishing her family’s mahogany table she made a plastic top saying “if anybody important comes to stay we’ll take it off” it never came off including during a visit to her house by margaret thatcher hunter gordon’s drawing room became a laboratory of invention with her children nigel and frances often roped in to serve as models facebook twitter pinterest boots began to sell valerie hunter gordon’s nappies in all their branches in  daughter of sir vincent ziani de ferranti and his wife dorothy nee wilson she was born in the peak district in the small derbyshire village of baslow into a family of inventors her grandfather sebastian ziani de ferranti was an italianliverpudlian electrical engineer being one of the few experts on alternatingcurrent electricity in britain in  he designed the world’s first modern power station at deptford southeast london valerie’s father oversaw the expansion of the family business ferranti into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfather’s house living nearby until his death in  he worked often at home and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives “i suspect that is where she learned if you have a need and it’s not fulfilled then maybe you could do something about it yourself” said her son nigel “i know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing and she loved to listen to it” she attended the convent of the sacred heart school in roehampton southwest london run by a french teaching order of nuns after the second world war the school relocated to the surrey village of woldingham and presently exists as woldingham school in  she married a scottish major and electrical engineer patrick hunter gordon both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from dunkirk – her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes by way of the spanish border arriving home just in time for their wedding when patrick left the army in  the family moved to beauly  miles west of inverness he took over a family business ai welders and cable belts he suffered from posttraumatic illness in which she was a constant support he in turn requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially her father also was an unflagging supporter hunter gordon wrote to the nappymakers robinsons of chesterfield who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the s at a royal society dinner her father then found himself seated beside the company’s chairman sir robert robinson – which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to chesterfield she convinced the company to produce them in bulk paying her royalties starting in late  those familiar with hunter gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject supremely confident in her own judgment she was nonetheless personally modest and selfeffacing she said later if she had known the amount of work involved in seeing her invention through she “would have gone on washing the damned things” patrick died in a car accident in  she is survived by their six children hugh alison nigel – the inspiration and model for the original disposable nappy – frances richard and kit  grandchildren and
