hupp robert m foote craig s mielke patrick m kinnally paul g krentz joseph c loran and gerald k hodge indiv and dba partners of the law firm of murphy hupp foote mielke and kinnally defendantsappellees appeal from the circuit court of kane county no l honorable timothy q sheldon judge presiding justice geiger delivered the opinion of the court the plaintiff john popp jr appeals from the may   order of the circuit court of kane county dismissing his complaint with prejudice pursuant to section a of the code of civil procedure the code  ilcs a west  the plaintiff brought the instant action seeking to recover damages for allegedly libelous statements contained in a letter written by the defendant timothy oneil who was an associate with the law firm of murphy hupp foote mielke  kinnally the murphy firm in dismissing the plaintiffs complaint the trial court found that the content of the letter was absolutely privileged and could not form the basis of a libel action we affirm the following facts are taken from the plaintiffs complaint on november   timothy oneil sent a letter to michael fleming on the letterhead of the murphy firm at this time fleming was allegedly a business associate of the plaintiff the purpose of the correspondence was to advise fleming that the murphy firm would not be representing him in a potential personal injury claim among the stated reasons for this decision was the following further compounding the problem one of the witnesses is john popp of aurora if this firm were to undertake representing you john popp would hurt you tremendously because of our representation we have just finished legal proceedings against popp and his company in which we have won a substantial judgment popp lied on the stand in that case and because he hates this firm would not do you any favors for the reasons above we will decline to represent you in this case however that does not mean that another attorney would have the same view of the case or have the problem with john popp this letter was mailed to flemings residence the letter was apparently opened by flemings wife and its contents were read by both fleming and his wife on october   the plaintiff filed a complaint against oneil and each of the partners of the murphy firm the plaintiff alleged that the statements in the letter were libelous per se as they falsely and maliciously accused him of committing the offense of perjury the plaintiff alleged that the letter was read by fleming his wife and numerous other people and business associates on december   the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to section a of the code  ilcs a west  the defendants argued that the plaintiffs complaint was barred by the affirmative defense of truth specifically the defendants argued that oneils statement that popp lied on the stand was true on april   following a hearing the trial court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice the plaintiff filed an appeal and this court reversed the dismissal finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the plaintiff had actually lied on the stand see popp v oneil no   unpublished order under supreme court rule  on remand the defendants again moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section a of the code in the motion the defendants argued that oneils letter was absolutely privileged and could not form the basis of a libel action the defendants argued that the letter was a privileged communication between an attorney and a potential client preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding in support of the motion the defendants attached the affidavit of oneil in his affidavit oneil stated that prior to november   he had consulted with fleming about the possibility of representing fleming in a civil action arising out of a bar fight that had occurred between fleming and michael prate after speaking with fleming oneil obtained a copy of the police report concerning the fight the report identified the plaintiff as a possible witness thereafter oneil prepared and sent to fleming the allegedly defamatory letter in response to the motion to dismiss the plaintiff submitted the affidavits of fleming and his wife ginger fleming in his affidavit fleming stated that he had left a telephone message with the defendants law firm sometime during the first two weeks of november  concerning injuries that he had sustained in a bar fight in the third week of november  fleming received a telephone call from oneil who asked him to identify any witnesses to the injury after fleming advised oneil that the plaintiff had been with fleming at the time of the fight oneil told fleming that he did not want to be associated with the plaintiff and that neither he nor the murphy law firm would be able to take flemings case fleming indicated in his affidavit that he never had an opportunity to ask oneil to represent him nor did he ever consider himself to be a client of oneil or the murphy firm several days after this telephone conversation fleming received oneils letter in her affidavit ginger fleming stated that she had never been a client of the murphy firm she further stated that on or about november   she opened and read a letter that had been addressed to her husband and that had been written by oneil ginger fleming stated that she knew the plaintiff and that prior to reading oneils letter had always thought highly of his character and honesty on may   following a hearing the trial court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment the trial court found that oneils communication to fleming was pertinent to flemings proposed litigation and was therefore absolutely privileged the trial court therefore concluded that the letter could not serve as the basis for the plaintiffs claim of libel the plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal the plaintiffs sole contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that oneils letter was absolutely privileged the plaintiff argues that at the time that oneil wrote the letter fleming was not a potential client rather the plaintiff argues that oneil had already verbally rejected representation of fleming prior to publishing the letter the plaintiff therefore contends that at the time the letter was written the defendants were not engaged in the representation of a client alternatively the plaintiff argues that even if such a privilege was applicable it cannot extend to communications that were published to flemings wife finally the plaintiff argues that the legislatures enactment of the slander and libel act  ilcs  et seq west  displaced the common law privilege relied upon by the defendants a section  motion may be used to dispose of issues of law or easily proved issues of fact neade v engel  ill app d    the motion may be granted when the claim asserted is barred by some affirmative matter defeating the claim  ilcs a west  the trial court should grant a section  motion if after construing the documents in the light most favorable to the nonmovant it finds no disputed issues of fact draper v frontier insurance co  ill app d    in a defamation action the issue of absolute privilege is an affirmative defense that may be raised and determined by a section  motion to dismiss harris v newssun  ill app d    whether a particular statement is privileged is a question of law barakat v matz  ill app d    under certain circumstances an attorney is absolutely privileged to make defamatory statements the scope of the privilege is set forth in the restatement second of torts §  restatement which provides an attorney at law is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding or in the institution of or during the course and as part of a judicial proceeding in which he participates as counsel if it has some relation to the proceeding the privilege extends to outofcourt communications between attorney and client golden v mullen  ill app d    the privilege affords complete immunity irrespective of the attorneys knowledge of the statements falsity or the attorneys motives in publishing the defamatory matter golden  ill app d at  the only requirement is that the communication pertain to proposed or pending litigation golden  ill app d at  the pertinency requirement is not applied strictly and the privilege will attach even where the defamatory communication is not confined to specific issues related to the litigation libco corp v adams  ill app d    all doubts should be resolved in favor of a finding of pertinency skopp v first federal savings  ill app d    our research has uncovered no case considering whether the absolute privilege extends to defamatory statements made by an attorney to a potential client during a preliminary legal consultation rather all of the reported cases involve defamatory statements made after a legal proceeding had already been initiated we therefore must consider whether the same public policy considerations that protect an attorneys statements made to his or her client during the course of a legal proceeding may also be applied to protect an attorneys statements to a potential client during preliminary legal consultations see golden  ill app d at  looking to public policy to determine whether the absolute privilege should be applied to postlitigation communications the general public policy underlying the absolute privilege is the need for an attorney to be able to speak his mind fully and fearlessly when communicating with his client weiler v stern  ill app d    such an open and honest exchange is necessary for the client to assess the circumstances at hand and to determine the appropriate course of action golden  ill app d at  illinois courts have found that there is a tremendous public interest in protecting and facilitating this type of open communication and commentary golden  ill app d at  we agree with the defendants that the need for open and full communication is equally compelling during the preliminary legal consultations between an attorney and a potential client the purpose of such consultations is to permit an individual to seek counsel from a professional legal advisor concerning a matter of concern to the individual the need for full and frank consultation is essential in order for both the individual and the attorney to determine the potential courses of action and the desirability of creating an ongoing attorneyclient relationship indeed we note that the traditional attorneyclient privilege already protects confidential communications made by an individual to an attorney during a preliminary legal consultation see herbes v graham  ill app d    the traditional attorneyclient privilege applies whenever an individual seeks legal advice of any kind from a professional legal advisor in his capacity as such and the communications are made in confidence for such a purpose people v williams  ill d    in construing the traditional attorneyclient privilege courts have noted the need to encourage and promote full and frank consultation between an individual and a legal advisor in re marriage of johnson  ill app d    we believe that similar considerations mandate the protection of an attorneys defamatory statements to a potential client during a preliminary legal consultation as long as the statements are pertinent to a possible future legal proceeding see golden  ill app d at  even during an initial consultation the attorney must be able to open and honestly discuss the potential clients situation in order to determine the desirability of initiating legal proceedings we note that such a conclusion is in harmony with the commentary to section  of the restatement which indicates that the absolute privilege to publish defamatory matter extends to conferences and other communications preliminary to the proceeding restatement second of torts § comment a at   we therefore hold that the absolute privilege extended to the letter at issue in the instant case the content of the letter was pertinent to flemings potential lawsuit as it discussed oneils inability to handle the case due to prior conflicts with the plaintiff we also believe that the letter was privileged even though it was published after oneil had already verbally informed fleming that the defendants would not undertake legal representation the letter was intended to memorialize this conversation and to provide fleming with additional advice with respect to his personal injury action including his likelihood of success we believe that fleming was entitled to know the defendants precise reasons for declining representation in order to determine his next course of action we therefore conclude that the letter furthered an interest of social importance and that the absolute privilege applies see libco corp  ill app d at  we also reject the plaintiffs contention that the absolute privilege does not apply because the letter was read by flemings wife although it is true that an attorney is not privileged to make defamatory statements to persons other than the clients that he represents golden  ill app d at  there is no evidence that oneil made the allegedly defamatory comments to flemings wife the letter was addressed only to fleming not flemings wife we disagree with the plaintiffs assertion that the privilege is defeated merely because flemings wife intercepted and read flemings mail as his final contention the plaintiff argues that the slander and libel act  ilcs  et seq west  precludes application of an absolute privilege in the instant case section  of that act provides it shall be deemed slander and shall be actionable to charge any person with swearing falsely or with having sworn falsely or for using uttering or publishing words of to or concerning any person which in their common acceptation amount to such charge whether the words be spoken in conversation of and concerning a judicial proceeding or not  ilcs  west  the plaintiff asserts that this statutory language indicates that the legislature intended charges of false swearing to be actionable under any circumstances the plaintiff argues that the language of the statute negates the absolute privilege that the trial court applied here such an argument is without merit since the enactment of the slander and libel act in  illinois courts have consistently held that no action may be maintained upon any verbal or written statement made by an attorney during a legal proceeding that is pertinent to the matter in controversy see mcdavitt v boyer  ill    dean v kirkland  ill app    we are unaware of any authority holding that the slander and libel act eradicates the absolute privilege afforded attorneys to publish defamatory statements nor do we believe that the statutory language contained in section  contemplates such a result rather for the reasons articulated above we hold that the statements contained in oneils letter were absolutely privileged and that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to section a of the code for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the circuit court of kane county

patrick m kinnally paul g krentz joseph c loran craig s mielke william c murphy murphy hupp foote mielke  kinnally timothy d oneil the plaintiff john popp jr appeals from the may   order of the circuit court of kane county dismissing his complaint with prejudice pursuant to section a of the code of civil procedure the code  ilcs a west    the plaintiff brought the instant action seeking to recover damages for allegedly libelous statements contained in a letter written by the defendant timothy oneil who was an associate with the law firm of murphy hupp foote mielke  kinnally the murphy firm   in dismissing the plaintiffs complaint the trial court found that the content of the letter was absolutely privileged and could not form the basis of a libel action   we affirmthe following facts are taken from the plaintiffs complaint   on november   timothy oneil sent a letter to michael fleming on the letterhead of the murphy firm   at this time fleming was allegedly a business associate of the plaintiff   the purpose of the correspondence was to advise fleming that the murphy firm would not be representing him in a potential personal injury claim   among the stated reasons for this decision was the following“further compounding the problem one of the witnesses is john popp of aurora   if this firm were to undertake representing you john popp would hurt you tremendously because of our representation   we have just finished legal proceedings against popp and his company in which we have won a substantial judgment   popp lied on the stand in that case and because he hates this firm would not do you any favorsfor the reasons above we will decline to represent you in this case   however that does not mean that another attorney would have the same view of the case or have the problem with john popp”this letter was mailed to flemings residence   the letter was apparently opened by flemings wife and its contents were read by both fleming and his wifeon october   the plaintiff filed a complaint against oneil and each of the partners of the murphy firm   the plaintiff alleged that the statements in the letter were libelous per se as they falsely and maliciously accused him of committing the offense of perjury   the plaintiff alleged that the letter was read by fleming his wife and “numerous other people and business associates”on december   the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to section a of the code  ilcs  a west    the defendants argued that the plaintiffs complaint was barred by the affirmative defense of truth   specifically the defendants argued that oneils statement that “popp lied on the stand” was true   on april   following a hearing the trial court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice   the plaintiff filed an appeal and this court reversed the dismissal finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the plaintiff had actually lied on the stand   see popp v oneil  illappd   illdec   ned   unpublished order under supreme court rule on remand the defendants again moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section a of the code in the motion the defendants argued that oneils letter was absolutely privileged and could not form the basis of a libel action   the defendants argued that the letter was a privileged communication between an attorney and a potential client preliminary to a proposed judicial proceedingin support of the motion the defendants attached the affidavit of oneil   in his affidavit oneil stated that prior to november   he had consulted with fleming about the possibility of representing fleming in a civil action arising out of a bar fight that had occurred between fleming and michael prate   after speaking with fleming oneil obtained a copy of the police report concerning the fight   the report identified the plaintiff as a possible witness   thereafter oneil prepared and sent to fleming the allegedly defamatory letterin response to the motion to dismiss the plaintiff submitted the affidavits of fleming and his wife ginger fleming   in his affidavit fleming stated that he had left a telephone message with the defendants law firm sometime during the first two weeks of november  concerning injuries that he had sustained in a bar fight   in the third week of november  fleming received a telephone call from oneil who asked him to identify any witnesses to the injury   after fleming advised oneil that the plaintiff had been with fleming at the time of the fight oneil told fleming that he did not want to be associated with the plaintiff and that neither he nor the murphy law firm would be able to take flemings case   fleming indicated in his affidavit that he never had an opportunity to ask oneil to represent him nor did he ever consider himself to be a client of oneil or the murphy firm   several days after this telephone conversation fleming received oneils letterin her affidavit ginger fleming stated that she had never been a client of the murphy firm   she further stated that on or about november   she opened and read a letter that had been addressed to her husband and that had been written by oneil   ginger fleming stated that she knew the plaintiff and that prior to reading oneils letter had always thought highly of his character and honestyon may   following a hearing the trial court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment   the trial court found that oneils communication to fleming was pertinent to flemings proposed litigation and was therefore absolutely privileged   the trial court therefore concluded that the letter could not serve as the basis for the plaintiffs claim of libel   the plaintiff filed a timely notice of appealthe plaintiffs sole contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that oneils letter was absolutely privileged   the plaintiff argues that at the time that oneil wrote the letter fleming was not a potential client   rather the plaintiff argues that oneil had already verbally rejected representation of fleming prior to publishing the letter   the plaintiff therefore contends that at the time the letter was written the defendants were not engaged in the representation of a “client”   alternatively the plaintiff argues that even if such a privilege was applicable it cannot extend to communications that were published to flemings wife   finally the plaintiff argues that the legislatures enactment of the slander and libel act  ilcs  et seq west  displaced the common law privilege relied upon by the defendants a section  motion may be used to dispose of issues of law or easily proved issues of fact  neade v engel  illappd    illdec   ned     the motion may be granted when the claim asserted is barred by some affirmative matter defeating the claim   ilcs a west    the trial court should grant a section  motion if after construing the documents in the light most favorable to the nonmovant it finds no disputed issues of fact  draper v frontier insurance co  illappd    illdec   ned     in a defamation action the issue of absolute privilege is an affirmative defense that may be raised and determined by a section  motion to dismiss  harris v newssun  illappd    illdec   ned     whether a particular statement is privileged is a question of law  barakat v matz  illappd    illdec   ned   under certain circumstances an attorney is absolutely privileged to make defamatory statements   the scope of the privilege is set forth in the restatement second of torts §   restatement which provides“an attorney at law is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding or in the institution of or during the course and as part of a judicial proceeding in which he participates as counsel if it has some relation to the proceeding”the privilege extends to outofcourt communications between attorney and client  golden v mullen  illappd    illdec   ned     the privilege affords complete immunity irrespective of the attorneys knowledge of the statements falsity or the attorneys motives in publishing the defamatory matter  golden  illappd at   illdec   ned    the only requirement is that the communication pertain to proposed or pending litigation  golden  illappd at   illdec   ned    the pertinency requirement is not applied strictly and the privilege will attach even where the defamatory communication is not confined to specific issues related to the litigation  libco corp v adams  illappd    illdec   ned     all doubts should be resolved in favor of a finding of pertinency  skopp v first federal savings  illappd    illdec   ned  our research has uncovered no case considering whether the absolute privilege extends to defamatory statements made by an attorney to a potential client during a preliminary legal consultation   rather all of the reported cases involve defamatory statements made after a legal proceeding had already been initiated   we therefore must consider whether the same public policy considerations that protect an attorneys statements made to his or her client during the course of a legal proceeding may also be applied to protect an attorneys statements to a potential client during preliminary legal consultations   see golden  illappd at   illdec   ned  looking to public policy to determine whether the absolute privilege should be applied to postlitigation communications the general public policy underlying the absolute privilege is the need for an attorney to be able to speak his mind fully and fearlessly when communicating with his client  weiler v stern  illappd    illdec   ned     such an open and honest exchange is necessary for the client to assess the circumstances at hand and to determine the appropriate course of action  golden  illappd at   illdec   ned    illinois courts have found that there is a “tremendous public interest” in protecting and facilitating this type of open communication and commentary  golden  illappd at   illdec   ned we agree with the defendants that the need for open and full communication is equally compelling during the preliminary legal consultations between an attorney and a potential client   the purpose of such consultations is to permit an individual to seek counsel from a professional legal advisor concerning a matter of concern to the individual   the need for full and frank consultation is essential in order for both the individual and the attorney to determine the potential courses of action and the desirability of creating an ongoing attorneyclient relationship indeed we note that the traditional attorneyclient privilege already protects confidential communications made by an individual to an attorney during a preliminary legal consultation   see herbes v graham  illappd    illdec   ned     the traditional attorneyclient privilege applies whenever an individual seeks legal advice of any kind from a professional legal advisor in his capacity as such and the communications are made in confidence for such a purpose   people v williams  illd    illdec   ned     in construing the traditional attorneyclient privilege courts have noted the need to encourage and promote full and frank consultation between an individual and a legal advisor  in re marriage of johnson  illappd    illdec   ned  we believe that similar considerations mandate the protection of an attorneys defamatory statements to a potential client during a preliminary legal consultation as long as the statements are pertinent to a possible future legal proceeding   see golden  illappd at   illdec   ned    even during an initial consultation the attorney must be able to open and honestly discuss the potential clients situation in order to determine the desirability of initiating legal proceedings   we note that such a conclusion is in harmony with the commentary to section  of the restatement which indicates that the absolute privilege to publish defamatory matter extends to “conferences and other communications preliminary to the proceeding”  restatement second of torts §  comment a at   we therefore hold that the absolute privilege extended to the letter at issue in the instant case   the content of the letter was pertinent to flemings potential lawsuit as it discussed oneils inability to handle the case due to prior conflicts with the plaintiff   we also believe that the letter was privileged even though it was published after oneil had already verbally informed fleming that the defendants would not undertake legal representation   the letter was intended to memorialize this conversation and to provide fleming with additional advice with respect to his personal injury action including his likelihood of success   we believe that fleming was entitled to know the defendants precise reasons for declining representation in order to determine his next course of action   we therefore conclude that the letter “furthered an interest of social importance” and that the absolute privilege applies   see libco corp  illappd at   illdec   ned  we also reject the plaintiffs contention that the absolute privilege does not apply because the letter was read by flemings wife   although it is true that an attorney is not privileged to make defamatory statements to persons other than the clients that he represents golden  illappd at   illdec   ned  there is no evidence that oneil made the allegedly defamatory comments to flemings wife   the letter was addressed only to fleming not flemings wife   we disagree with the plaintiffs assertion that the privilege is defeated merely because flemings wife intercepted and read flemings mail as his final contention the plaintiff argues that the slander and libel act  ilcs  et seq west  precludes application of an absolute privilege in the instant case   section  of that act provides“it shall be deemed slander and shall be actionable to charge any person with swearing falsely or with having sworn falsely or for using uttering or publishing words of to or concerning any person which in their common acceptation amount to such charge whether the words be spoken in conversation of and concerning a judicial proceeding or not”    ilcs  west the plaintiff asserts that this statutory language indicates that the legislature intended charges of false swearing to be actionable under any circumstances   the plaintiff argues that the language of the statute “negates” the absolute privilege that the trial court applied heresuch an argument is without merit   since the enactment of the slander and libel act in  illinois courts have consistently held that no action may be maintained upon any verbal or written statement made by an attorney during a legal proceeding that is pertinent to the matter in controversy   see mcdavitt v boyer  ill    ne    dean v kirkland  illapp    ned     we are unaware of any authority holding that the slander and libel act eradicates the absolute privilege afforded attorneys to publish defamatory statements   nor do we believe that the statutory language contained in section  contemplates such a result   rather for the reasons articulated above we hold that the statements contained in oneils letter were absolutely privileged and that the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to section a of the codefor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the circuit court of
