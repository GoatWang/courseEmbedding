replacement windows affordable windows projects and options by nicole seaton one of the smartest and costeffective ways to save money on your monthly bills is to replace the windows in your home compared to other expensive and timeconsuming home improvements window replacement is an upgrade that can help retain the heat in your home and greatly minimize your heating bill if you live in an older residence you might have singlepane windows that do not have todays innovative technology that keeps the cold out and the warmth inside in the summer months modern windows perform the opposite function some even have special protection against ultraviolet rays deflecting the sun on the hottest summer days double the pane equals financial gain the first consideration in upgrading your windows is single or doublepane although singlepane windows are less expensive double pane windows offer added protection from the heat and cold and they also protect your home from dust debris and pests you might think that youre saving money by purchasing cheap windows but if you spend a little more youll see an instant return on your investment when you open your next power bill highquality modern double pane windows should adhere to industry standards set by the national fenestration rating council if your windows have an nfrc label you can be sure they are highquality windows that can last for generations windows with multiple panes can be filled with gases like krypton and argon which helps reduce heat loss and increases rvalues or resistance to heat loss the higher the rvalue the better your new windows can protect against heat loss another factor to consider is the windows uvalue or its resistance to heat transfer when researching window options both rvalue and uvalue information should be available for the entire window some manufacturers only offer this information for the middle of the window there are many styles of modern windows to choose from but not every option may fit your budget some options companies offer dont necessarily make a difference in savings for instance window companies might try to talk you into double pane windows with more than one inch between the windows while this space between the windows creates better insulation more than an inch does not make for more energy efficient windows its actually wasted space window companies and installers get multiple estimates before buying now is a great time to find affordable windows that meet your budget many window companies will come directly to your home to show you the different kinds of replacement windows and window materials its a good idea to get more than one estimate some companies have seasonal sales or special incentives for firsttime customers by shopping around
