advisors skip to content minis  company  investment advisors our philosophy our investment philosophy balances the higher return potential available in stocks with the relative safety available in cash and fixed income investments we select stocks based on their average growth prospect and selling price investments of fixed income are executed by ensuring safety of principal while pursuing the best available yield stocks stocks selected have the potential for above average total return over a one to five year time horizon  our analysis of equities measures each company’s financial strength growth and stability of profits and management competence  we strive to buy shares of very good companies at a price that is at a discount to the intrinsic value of the enterprise  sustainable growing cash flows and high returns on equity without excess leverage are important characteristics  once a stock achieves its potential return or target price at least a portion is sold cash  fixed income we use money market funds and us treasury bills for cash and equivalents us treasury notes and bonds and investmentgrade municipals if appropriate are acquired when investing in the fixed income market additionally we will purchase federal agency or high quality corporate bonds and fdic insured certificates of deposit our approach is to ladder out maturities as far as ten years thereby reducing

  leaving a legacy youve worked hard over the years to accumulate wealth and you probably find it comforting to know that after your death the assets you leave behind will continue to be a source of support for your family friends and the causes that are important to you but to ensure that your legacy reaches your heirs as you intend you must make the proper arrangements nowthere are four basic ways to leave a legacy  by will  by trust  by beneficiary designation and  by joint ownership arrangementswillsa will is the cornerstone of any estate plan you should have a will no matter how much your estate is worth and even if youve implemented other estate planning strategiesyou can leave property by will in two ways making specific bequests and making general bequests a specific bequest directs a particular piece of property to a particular person i leave aunt marthas diamond broach to my niece jen a general bequest is typically a percentage of property or property that is left over after all specific bequests have been madetypically principal heirs receive general bequests i leave all the rest of my property to my wife jane with a will you can generally leave any type of property to whomever you wish with some exceptions including property will pass according to a beneficiary designation even if you name a different beneficiary for the same property in your will property owned jointly with rights of survivorship passes directly to the joint owner property in a trust passes according to the terms of the trust your surviving spouse has a right to a statutory share eg 0 of your property regardless of what you leave him or her in your will children may have inheritance rights in certain statesleaving property outright to minor children is problematic you should name a custodian or property guardian or use a trusttrustsyou can also leave property to your heirs using a trusttrust property passes directly to the trust beneficiaries according to the trust terms there are two basic types of trusts  living or revocable and  irrevocableliving trusts are very flexible because you can change the terms of the trust eg rename beneficiaries and the property in the trust at any time you can even change your mind by taking your property back and ending the trustan irrevocable trust on the other hand cant be changed or ended except by its terms but can be useful if you want to minimize estate taxes or protect your property from potential creditorsyou create a trust by executing a document called a trust agreement you should have an attorney draft any type of trust to be sure it accomplishes what you wanta trust cant distribute property it does not own so you must also transfer ownership of your property to the name of the trust property without ownership documentation eg jewelry tools furniture are transferred to a trust by listing the items on a trust schedule property with ownership documents must be retitled or reregistered you must also name a trustee to administer the trust and manage the trust property with a living trust you can name yourself trustee but youll need to name a successor trustee wholl transfer the property to your heirs after your deathtip a living trust is also a good way to protect your property in case you become incapacitatedbeneficiary designationsproperty that is contractual in nature such as life insurance annuities and retirement accounts passes to heirs by beneficiary designationtypically all you have to do is fill out a form and sign it beneficiaries can be persons or entities such as a charity or a trust and you can name multiple beneficiaries to share the proceeds you should name primary and contingent beneficiariesyou shouldnt name minor children as beneficiaries you can however name a guardian to receive the proceeds for the benefit of the minor childyou should consider the income and estate tax ramifications for your heirs and your estate when naming a beneficiary for example proceeds your beneficiaries receive from life insurance are generally not subject to income tax while your beneficiaries will have to pay income tax on proceeds received from taxdeferred retirement plans eg traditional irascheck with your financial planning professional to determine whether your beneficiary designations will have the desired resultsbe sure to reevaluate your beneficiary designations when your circumstances change eg marriagedivorce death of beneficiary you cant change the beneficiary with your will or a trust you must fill out and sign a new beneficiary designation formsome beneficiaries cant be changed for example a divorce decree may stipulate that an exspouse will receive the proceedstip certain bank accounts and investments also allow you to name someone to receive the asset at your deathjoint ownership arrangementstwo or more persons can own property equally and at the death of one the other becomes the sole ownerthis type of ownership is called joint tenancy with rights of survivorship jtwrs a jtwrs arrangement between spouses is known as tenancy by the entirety in certain states and a handful of states have a form of joint ownership known as community propertythere is another type of joint ownership called tenancy in common where there is no right of survivorship property held as tenancy in common will not pass to a joint owner automatically although you can leave your interest in the property to your heirs in your willyou may find joint ownership arrangements are useful and convenient with some types of property but may not be desirable with all of your property for example having a joint checking account ensures that upon your death an heir will have immediate access to needed cash and owning an outof state residence jointly eg a vacation home can avoid an ancillary probate process in that state but it may not be practical to own property jointly where frequent transactions are involved eg your investment portfolio or business assets because you may need the joint owners approval and signature for each transactionthere are some other disadvantages to joint ownership arrangements including  your coowner has immediate access to your property  naming someone who is not your spouse as coowner may trigger gift tax consequences and  if the coowner has debt problems creditors may go after the coowners shareunlike with most other types of property a coowner of your checking or savings account can withdraw the entire balance without your knowledge or consentimportant disclosures this information has
