faceliftfacelift in austin texas many patients look in the mirror and are discouraged because the face they see looks older and more tired than they feel a facelift and necklift can address this concern face and neck lifting surgery is successfully performed on healthy patients ranging in age from their ’s to well in their ’s a facelift cannot stop the aging process however what it can do is give your face a healthy and more youthful appearance many patients experience increased selfconfidence as the face in the mirror now more accurately represents their psychological rather than chronological maturity as with all facial plastic surgery general good health and realistic expectations are prerequisites you should seek out a trusted austin plastic surgeon before  after photos each patient is unique and individual results may vary a facenecklift primarily treats the jawline and neck areas more specifically it treats the lower half of the face in the past pulling the skin back was the only method of facelifting which would lead to an artificial “windswept” look poor wound healing and transient results more aggressive surgery was in vogue during the ’s and ’s but has fallen out of favor with many surgeons because of the long operative time higher risk of surgery protracted recovery period and minimal cosmetic benefit dr buckingham utilizes the newest minimally invasive techniques with incisions nearly entirely confined to and camouflaged within the hairline this reduces recovery time and leads to the most natural appearing and longlasting results dr buckingham tailors his facelift to fit the patient’s needs and wishes limited incision facelifts are performed for patients with thin necks and minimal neck banding with substantial results see our section on limited incision facelift for more details and photos for patients with more advanced aging including neck fatty pockets significant neck bands or more advanced skin sagging a more involved but still minimally traumatic facelift is performed unlike our limited incision facelift where the anterior neck is not opened in patients who require these techniques we make a small incision under the chin where fat can be gently removed and the platysma muscle can be sutured in the midline a completely concealed incision is then place around the ears and in the hairline to expose the smas which is lifted and elevated resuspending the face to a more youthful position even with this procedure dr buckingham tailors the smas elevation based on the patient’s needs for those patients with thin faces and moderate jowling and neck laxity the smas will be elevated a shorter distance for patients with heavy faces and more significant aging the smas will be elevated as a deep plane composite flap allowing for maximal improvement regardless of the approach used our patients are ready for social activities within  days and are fully active in  weeks some residual swelling and firm areas will persist and continue to improve for as long as  months but these areas are usually minor and not noticeable without close inspection to determine if a patient is a good candidate for this procedure dr buckingham recommends a private patient consultation dr buckingham feels that successful facial plastic surgery results from the development and maintenance of good rapport between the patient the surgeon and his staff during the consultation and future appointments the consultation will include a complete facial analysis to determine the best procedure to bring about the desired results and all questions relating to the patient’s specific concerns will be addressed prospective patients are encouraged to call the office to schedule an appointment at their earliest convenience frequently asked facelift questions q – what is a facelift a facelift is a procedure to lift sagging tissues of the face it is a generic term that patients and some surgeons use to describe more specifically browforehead lift midface lift or lower facelift we use the term facelift to refer to the lower face and usually call it a “lower facelift” it is a procedure that addresses the neck and jawline or if you draw an oblique line from the corner of the mouth to the upper ear it improves everything below that line many different kinds or degrees of facelifts can be performed and are tailored to the particular patient some involve incisions only in front of the ear while others involve a small incision under the chin to perform a submentoplasty followed by an incision around the ear and a deep plane facelift q – who is the best candidate for a facelift the best candidate for a facelift is someone who is medically fit a facelift can be beneficial for patients experiencing
