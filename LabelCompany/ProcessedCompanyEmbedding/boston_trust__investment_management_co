profitable stock play of  owcp   in  cell phones are as vital to us as the air we breathe between both old and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements owcp   massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before   qb status and  stars from morningstar  this is a statement that often attracts negativity from skeptics and selfpronounced market professionals and frankly its understandable it seems too good to be true we always encourage our readers to do their own duediligence and this is one of those scenarios dig through message boards scanners and blogs and youll quickly realize that stocks are making major moves like this on a regular basis this isnt some mythical unicorn  once again stocks do this on a regular basis below you can see some examples of movements like this but believe us when we say there are many many more  one trade can make profits of  or more  bldv   at the time of writing this article itll is sitting at  cents we believe that this is an extremely attractive price for a company of this caliber as was observed above acquisitions in this industry often come in at hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in addition to this  cents is an excellent place for traders and investors to turn quicker profits it is much easier for a stock to double or triple at these prices in a very short period of time it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”  warren buffet  the stock is priced right better than right  website   intelligentcloudresourcescomfloat          learn more the otcqb is an elite tier of the over the counter markets these are companies that have audited financials available are current in their reporting have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet all in all this signifies that itll is on the ball and doing business the right way morningstar rates otcitll at an excellent  stars meaning it is of fair value the rating is determined by three factors a stocks current price morningstars estimate of the stocks fair value and the uncertainty rating of the fair value the bigger the discount the higher the star rating once

encourage you to do your due diligence thoroughly before making a buying decision good trading sincerely the american tech report team keep track of otc itll filings and disclosure sign up for updates on newscharts and other information we respect your privacy and never share your information with anyone  when going up against telecom giants a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out through our due diligence we have found this to be undoubtedly true for itll the cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available smartphones are expensive for your average consumer as many flagship phones sit around the  mark itll has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer leagoo these phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost they are well built stylish powerful and power through daily functions like taking photographs and browsing the web on par with phones that are five times the price all of this seems consistent with itlls commitment to lower prices and maintain their competitive edge in addition to this they are offering all subscribers a premium mastercard no questions asked we believe that many consumers will find this to be an irresistible offer making the growth potential for itll very attractive   the most competitive tech and

our website americantechreportcom and in newsletters text message alerts audio services live interviews featured “research” reports on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in a campaign we are paid to advertise the profiled issuers intelligent cloud resources inc american tech report has been hired by a third party golden island investments ltd for a period beginning on

hold while we tell investors to purchase during the campaign intelligent cloud resources inc is a penny stock that was illiquid little to no trading volume prior to our campaign and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume during the campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each profile issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure when the campaign ends the volume and price of the profiled issuer will likely decrease dramatically as a result investors who purchase during the campaign and hold

ie in its quarterly and annual reports or if it is an otc markets pink sheet quoted company it may be delinquent in its pink sheet reporting obligations which may result in otc markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the profiled issuer at wwwotcmarketscom as follows i “limited information” for companies with financial reporting problems economic distress or that are unwilling to file
