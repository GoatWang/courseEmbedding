obamas failed leadership by mollie reilly k k in a wall street journal oped published tuesday evening house speaker john boehner rohio blamed president obama for the nearly  trillion in acrosstheboard spending cuts set to go into effect next month labeling the looming cuts as the presidents sequester most americans are just hearing about this washington creation for the first time the sequester boehner writes what they might not realize from mr obamas statements is that it is a product of the presidents own failed leadership boehner continues there is nothing wrong with cutting spending that much  we should be cutting even more  but the sequester is an ugly and dangerous way to do it the sequester stems from the budget control act of  which mandated the cuts if a congressional super committee failed to reach an agreement on how to reduce the deficit in november  the bipartisan group announced it hadnt reached a deal meaning the cuts to defense and domestic spending would go into effect in january  the sequester was later delayed to begin march  as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations in the oped boehner slams the president for not offering a detailed plan that can pass congress as the presidents outrage about the sequester grows in coming days republicans have a simple response mr president we agree that your sequester is bad policy boehner writes what spending are you willing to cut to replace it boehners latest comments continue the backandforth blame game between republicans and democrats over the quickly approaching cuts earlier tuesday obama pushed congress to pass his plan to offset the cuts which includes tax increases for the wealthy as well as spending cuts republicans in congress face a simple choice obama said are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest americans and biggest corporations in a statement boehner pushed back on the presidents speech just last month the president got his higher taxes on the wealthy and hes already back for more the house speaker said do you have information you want to share with huffpost here’s how also on huffpost do these things

republicans wont repeal and replace obamacare they’re basically going to fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it boehner said share on facebook share on twitter former house speaker john boehner predicted on thursday that a full repeal and replace of obamacare is “not what’s going to happen” and that republicans will instead just make some fixes to the health care law boehner who retired in  amid unrest among conservatives said at an orlando healthcare conference that gop lawmakers were too optimistic in their talk of quickly repealing and then replacing obamacarestory continued below “they’ll fix obamacare and i shouldn’t have called it repeal and replace because that’s not what’s going to happen they’re basically going to fix the flaws and put a more conservative box around it” boehner said the former speaker’s frank comments capture the conundrum that many republicans find themselves in as they try to deliver on pledges to axe obamacare but struggle to coalesce around an alternative republican lawmakers across the country this week are facing angry constituents at town halls worried that obamacare will be yanked away without a suitable replacement president donald trump has said in recent days that he will release a plan by early to midmarch on how the administration plans to move forward on repealandreplace but so far no clear path has emerged earlier in the panel discussion boehner said he “started laughing” when republicans started talking about moving lightning fast on repeal and then coming up with an alternative in the  years that i served in the united states congress republicans never ever one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like not once” boehner said “and all this happy talk that went on in november and december and january about repeal repeal repeal—yeah well do replace replace—i started laughing because if you pass repeal without replace first anything that happens is your fault you broke it” raucous crowd rocks cotton town hall boehner added that he has told republican leaders that unless a repeal is packaged with a replacement gop lawmakers would not likely reach a consensus about an alternative to obamacare and secondly as i told some of the republican leaders when they asked i said if you pass repeal without replace youll never pass replace because they will never ever agree on what the bill should be perfect always becomes the enemy of the good” boehner said boehner said what republicans ultimately come up with could share a lot of the same qualities with obamacare most of the affordable care act in the framework is going to stay there coverage for kids up to age  covering those with preexisting conditions all of thats going to be there subsidies for those who cant afford it who arent on medicaid who i call the working poor subsidies for them will be there boehner said what will be different is that cms will not dictate to every single state how the plans going to run and if the state wants to run an exchange the state can run an exchange the states will control the policies that are offered like they control every other insurance product offered in their

house speaker from “couch commander” a comedic video played at the white house correspondents’ association dinner on saturdaycredit it was the most unexpected cameo of the white house correspondents’ association dinner on saturday there in the video with president obama was none other than john a boehner the former house speaker on monday white house officials said that mr boehner was a good sport when they called to see if he would join in the comedic tradition of producing a presidential video for the gala dinner “as was evident from the finished product he was an enthusiastic participant in the production” josh earnest the white house press secretary told reporters filming took place on friday just a day before the dinner and gave the president and his onetime legislative adversary plenty of time to hang out mr earnest said there was no separate formal meeting but he did not deny that they might have talked about current events the two men spent time together just a day after mr boehner’s comments about senator ted cruz of texas — “lucifer in the flesh” — were reported mr earnest said “there was not a detailed discussion of those comments no” but it’s clear they had a good time just from watching the video especially the part where mr boehner offers mr obama a cigarette and the president’s eyes widen longingly “look speaker boehner has a wellknown and very good sense of humor” mr earnest said “he made i think a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film” in a post on twitter on monday mr boehner said he had a good time filming the video with the president and noted that the “cigarette gag was president’s idea nice job by whitehouse media team” follow the new york times politics and washington on facebook and twitter and sign up for the first

applewhiteap former house speaker john a boehner continued a streak of remarkable postoffice candor during a wednesday appearance at a houston energy conference telling a luncheon audience that president trump’s term has — foreign policy aside — been a “complete disaster” “everything else he’s done has been a complete disaster” boehner rohio said according to a report in rigzone an online energy publication “he’s still learning how to be president” boehner who resigned from congress in october  had praised trump — a friend and golfing companion from his political years — during the presidential campaign on wednesday he praised trump’s efforts at getting serious about combating the islamic state terror group rigzone reported but ended his positive comments there among other remarks boehner said trump should not be allowed to tweet the publication said dave schnittger an aide to boehner said friday the remarks made at the kpmg global energy conference were “reported accurately” by rigzone dan scavino jr the white house social media director responded friday evening on twitter john boehner is the disaster pictwittercomnzgompe — dan scavino jr danscavino may   boehner has made other public comments critical of his party since leaving office during the presidential campaign in april  he called thengop candidate ted cruz “lucifer in the flesh” and in february he made a prescient prediction that a gop replacement for the affordable care act was “not going to happen” and that “republicans never ever agree on health care” — a view he maintained on wednesday according to the rigzone report boehner offered other blunt opinions wednesday rigzone reported he gave an increasingly pessimistic view that congressional republicans would pass tax reform saying “now my odds are ” and that tax reform is “a bunch of happy talk” and he echoed an emerging piece of dc conventional wisdom by calling the border adjustment tax plan favored by paul d ryan rwis boehner’s successor as house speaker “deader than a doornail” and on the various pending investigations into alleged russian influence on the election and on trump’s campaign boehner said “they need to get to the bottom of this” but called impeachment a folly pushed by “crazy leftwing democratic colleagues of mine” “talk of impeachment is the best way to rile up trump supporters” he said according to rigzone “remember impeachment is not a legal process it’s a political process” boehner as he has said in the past repeated wednesday that he does not miss his old job “i wake up every day drink my morning coffee and say ‘hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah’” he said according to rigzone powerpost powerpost false endofarticle true please provide a valid email address sign up you’re all set

articles you can view photo credit gage skidmore former house speaker john boehner who oversaw multiple attempts to undo obamacare during his tenure predicted thursday that most of president obamas health care law is going to stay there and that previous talk of repealing and replacing the law amounted to happy talk boehner told a health care conference in orlando he was unsure if the gops legislating on the issue would resemble the democrats strongarm approach several years prior but he was more certain of how the substance will look most of the affordable care act in the framework is going to stay there coverage for kids up to age  covering those with preexisting conditions all of thats going to be there subsidies for those who cant afford it who arent on medicaid who i call the

and if the state wants to run an exchange the state can run an exchange the states will control the policies that are offered like they control every other insurance product offered in their states he concluded that such an outcome was not all that hard to game out what does add some unpredictability is that republicans have failed to rally around a single health care reform proposal for which the former speaker ripped his party in the  years that i served in the united states congress republicans never ever one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like not once and all this happy talk that went on in november and december and january about repeal repeal repeal—yeah well do replace replace—i started laughing because if you pass repeal without replace first anything that
