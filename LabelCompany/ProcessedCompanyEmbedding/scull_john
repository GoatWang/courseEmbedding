valleys toppaid executive with an annual salary of us million sales at apple increased from  million to  billion under sculleys management although many attribute his success to the fact that sculley joined the company just when steve jobs visions and steve wozniaks creations had become highly lucrative however his stint at apple remains controversial due to his departure from founder steve jobss sales structure particularly regarding sculleys decision to compete with ibm in selling computers to the same types of customers others say that the two clashed over management styles and priorities jobs focusing on future innovation and sculley more on current product lines and profitability but sculley ultimately was forced to step down as apple ceo because he was opposed to licensing macintosh software and was talking to goldmansachs about splitting apple into two companies when sculley left in may  apple had  billion in cash and  million in debt sculley is recognized as an expert in marketing in part because of his early successes at pepsico notably his introduction of the pepsi challenge which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival cocacola he used similar marketing strategies throughout the s and s at apple to massmarket macintosh personal computers and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies sculley is currently

architectural design from brown university and an mba from the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania careeredit – pepsicolaedit sculley joined the pepsicola division of pepsico in  as a trainee where he participated in a sixmonth training program at a bottling plant in pittsburgh in  at the age of  sculley became the companys youngest marketing vicepresidentcitation needed sculley initiated one of the companys first consumerresearch studies an extended inhome product test in which  families participated as a result of the research pepsi decided to launch new larger and more varied packages of their soft drinks in  pepsi set out to dethrone cocacola as the market leader of the industry in what eventually became known as the cola wars pepsi began spending more on marketing and advertising typically paying between us and  for each television spot while most companies spent between  and  with the pepsi generation campaign pepsi aimed to overturn cocacolas classic marketing sculley also took the position of managing pepsicos international food operations division shortly after he visited a failing potatochip factory in paris pepsicos food division was their only moneylosing division with revenues of us million and losses of  million to make the food division profitable sculley fired all the people from it fritolay and improved product quality as well as improving accounts and establishing financial controls within three years the food division was making us million in revenues and  million in profit sculley was best known at pepsi for the pepsi challenge an advertising campaign he started in  to compete against cocacola to gain market share using heavily advertised taste tests it claimed based on sculleys own research that pepsicola tasted better than cocacola the pepsi challenge included a series of television advertisements that first aired in the early s featuring lifelong cocacola drinkers participating in blind taste tests pepsis soft drink was always chosen as the preferred product by the participant however these tests have been criticized as being biasedcitation needed the pepsi challenge was mostly targeted at the texas market where pepsi had a significantly lower market share at the time the campaign was successful significantly increasing pepsis market share in that state at the time the pepsi challenge was started sculley was senior vicepresident of united states sales and marketing operations at pepsi sculley himself took the taste test and picked coke instead of pepsi in  sculley was named pepsis youngestever ceo and president – apple computer incedit apple lured sculley away from pepsi in order to apply his marketing skills to the personal computer market steve jobs successfully sealed the deal after he made his legendary pitch to sculley do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world apples president mike markkula wanted to retire and believed that jobs who wished to be the companys president lacked the discipline and temperament needed to run apple on a daily basis sculley with his solid business background and considerable recent success would give apple an image of greater reliability and stability from the time they first met in  until  jobs and sculley had what both acknowledged as an amazing partnership sculley used his marketing experience to help keep the aging apple ii generating muchneeded cash and helped jobs launch the mac with the most admired consumer marketing campaign of its time jobs was the product czar

planned  using the additional money for higher profit margins and expensive advertising campaigns macintosh sold well and received excellent reviews but it did not put the ibm pc out of business some of the privileges of jobs elite development groups were trimmed and projects were subject to stricter review for usefulness marketability feasibility and reasonable costcitation needed at the peak of the macintosh success apple made an attempt to move unsold inventory of lisa computers by renaming it to macintosh xl and positioning it as a topoftheline pro macintosh model since lisa lacked the userfriendliness of the macintosh and did not use the macintosh rom or operating system this idea had little successcitation needed at this point a power struggle between jobs and sculley was becoming obvious jobs became nonlinear he kept meetings running past midnight sent out lengthy faxes then called new meetings at  am sculley had little control over the macintosh division where jobs was the general manager the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out about jobss plans and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year sculley said in  that jobs never forgave him and their friendship was never repaired after jobs left the company
