contract owners will receive prior written notice of this date   specific comments                             comment  the name of the program “enhanced” surrender value is misleading as the value

enhancement  as noted above everyone who accepts the offer will no longer have the fees associated to the rider or underlying contract a percentage of those eligible will no longer have the fees and will benefit from waiver of remaining surrender charges  further a percentage will benefit from the enhanced account value as well as the waiver of surrender charges and fees accordingly registrant respectfully declines to rename the program as each contract owner will receive some type of enhancement above contract level surrender value                                comment use either “full surrender request” or ‘liquidation request” but don’t use both   response  agreed registrant updated the supplement to only use the term “full surrender request”                                comment  add a definition of “in good order”   response  agreed registrant defined in good order in the supplement                      comment if there is no compensation paid to agents consider stating this in the supplement   response  agreed  registrant added disclosure in the supplement that no compensation is paid to financial intermediaries                      comment  in the nd paragraph please clarify that accepting the offer will result in termination of the contract and any benefits   response  agreed registrant clarified that the contract riders and benefits terminate and made the disclosure prominent in bold typeset                      comment  in the rd paragraph please clarify that if you do not accept the offer that your contract and riders will continue unchanged   response  agreed registrant added disclosure that if the offer is not accepted the contract owner does not need to take any action and the contract and riders benefits will continue                      comment bold the sentence that states you are not required to accept this offer   response  agreed  registrant has bolded the sentence that states contract owners are not required to accept this offer                      comment  please provide a description in the supplement of the acknowledgement form and the surrender form in the supplement and bold the sentence that states if we don’t receive the acknowledgement form and just receive the liquidation form we will process the surrender but you won’t get the enhanced value   response  agreed a description of the forms has been added to the supplement with bolded disclosure that both forms must be received in order for the contract owner to receive the enhanced surrender value                      comment in the formula calculation in b — state whether any applicable fees will be deducted   response  agreed disclosure was added to the formula b that any applicable fees upon surrender will be waived

of supplement effective date                      comment in the discussion of if you plan on using the proceeds to purchase a new annuity and there will be a new surrender please change “will” to “may”   response  agreed  registrant has changed the wording from “will” to “may”                      comment in the examples please add an example where the contact owner does not benefit and get an enhanced surrender value   response  agreed registrant added as example  an illustration where there is no additional surrender value amount however fees are waived                      comment please add a description of the life income benefit ii rider   response  agreed registrant added disclosure describing the lifetime income benefit ii rider as a guaranteed benefit rider designed to help protect your investment from poor market performance through potential annual automatic payment base increases provide longevity protection through lifetime benefit payments and ensure a death benefit equivalent to the greater of premium payments reduced for partial surrenders or contract value                      comment why do some filings include the prospectus and others don’t   response  registrant is bringing previously great wested products out of great west  we confirm that we have not made any other material changes                      comment  if the enhanced surrender value program is eligible on any contracts that have a bonus feature describe how the bonus feature works with the program will the bonus be recaptured   response  certain “bonus” or plus contracts are eligible for the program if the offer is accepted we will not recapture any bonuses or payment enhancements we added disclosure that premium enhancements will not be recaptured                      comment if hartford may make a better offer in the future consider adding this disclosure   response  agreed disclosure was added in the last paragraph of the supplement that after the offer termination date we may offer different andor more favorable programs to other contract owners                      comment include a copy of the rider in the registration statement      response  agreed  the rider is incorporated as an exhibit to the part c of each registration statement                      comment please update the powers of attorney to include lisa proch   response  agreed  the powers of attorney have been updated and incorporated into part c of each registration statement                      comment  please consider adding the amount of the surrender value the customer would get in the letter that we will be sent to customers or a phone number where they could obtain it   response  since the actual amount of the surrender value fluctuates due to market performance we are not going to include the surrender value in the letter because we feel it will provide confusion  the letter does include a phone number for our annuity customer service area and customers can obtain the amount of the current surrender value from the customer service representatives                      tandy representation   registrant hereby acknowledges that the staff of the commission
