with alexandria real estate equities founder ceo and chairman joel marcus as a corporate securities lawyer in the biotechnology sector in the s and early s joel marcus had a lot to learn about the business but one aspect of the fastgrowing industry made itself abundantly clear—there were not enough specialized facilities the need for buildings in which to experiment test and develop new treatments and marcus’ belief that life science companies are most successful when located in centers of innovation led him to found alexandria real estate equities inc nyse are alexandria is a real estate investment trust reit focused on collaborative science and technology campuses that enable life science companies to develop new medicines and treatments and after  years in business alexandria boasts more than  million square feet of officeand laboratory space in seven urban clusters in north america — from san francisco to north carolina’s research triangle park to the greater boston area — that are home to companies tackling some of the world’s most nettlesome diseases nyse recently spoke with marcus about alexandria’s cluster approach to development as well as the unique needs of life science companies in the st century when you identified the real estate bottleneck that was slowing the growth of the biotech industry did investors get the concept right off the bat or did it take some convincing it definitely took some convincing we met with  investors and  kicked us out they didn’t think it was the best idea they said “there’s no credit in this tenancy and the buildings are dangerous because they have chemicals and people are working on different experiments” what led you to persevere through that negative feedback the human genome was sequenced for the first time in  and we believed that the revolution of genetic engineering in biotech would create a whole slate of new medicines to prevent treat and cure disease we banked on that belief but everybody told us that these companies burn cash that they don’t have products they don’t make money and that they’re going to go bankrupt that was the lay of the land at the time but our thesis turned out to be true can you describe alexandria’s “cluster model” of campuses in a handful of urban centers that was one of our most important insights we believed that for these companies to thrive they needed to be located in a key urban location in a dense area of a large city but more than that a successful cluster needed some connection to topnotch scientific minds on the research and clinical sides they also had to be in places where you could find management talent and have access to an abundance of risk capital this formula was our secret sauce and when you visit some of our properties you’ll see a medallion that highlights those elements location science talent and capital when you started alexandria most biotech companies were located in suburban areas why did you focus on urban centers we believed that as the industry grew and accelerated people would cluster around major scientific institutions mit is a great example the financial value of the output of its technology researchers is equal to that of the eighth largest national gdp in the world and the scientific innovation it continues to foster makes the bostoncambridge area a very important cluster for us we are also in maryland because we thought people would cluster around the food and drug administration fda and national institutes of health nih in the san francisco cluster ucsf ucberkeley and stanford all serve as the anchor institutions how do these factors work together for biotech companies interaction is happening – the collaborative and innovative nature of these clusters allows commercial academic and clinical parties to interact and to develop treatments that close proximity is key to innovative and collaborative environments within those campuses we try to provide great amenities to keep people on campus and to improve productivity in new york city for example we have a fitness center and the city’s largest urban farm on site so the food at our oncampus restaurant is farmtotable we also have a stateoftheart conference center that allows us to host thoughtleadership events the collaborative and innovative nature of these clusters allows commercial academic and clinical parties to interact and to develop treatments that close proximity is key to innovative and collaborative environments how has alexandria’s perspective led it to evolve into more than just a landlord being so closely entwined with the biotech industry our platform has developed beyond real estate to include a large venture capital arm our connections with so many of the best and brightest in the industry have also led alexandria into the thought leadership programming arena where we host biotech summits that convene the top thinkers in the field it’s a davoslike event for biotech and that role as a forum for bigpicture thinking has helped lead us into a wide range of socially responsible initiatives are there any new urban centers that meet your cluster criteria the answer to that is a little bit sad the established clusters are winners and they continue their winning ways companies are moving to cambridge but they’re not moving to new haven or philadelphia the winners are winners because universities like mit ucsf or columbia and the access to highquality talent and capital that the cluster locations offer over the years there have been attempts to cultivate new clusters in memphis chicago denver and baltimore places like miami and st louis also have oneoff buildings but the industry has been very slow to move away from its established centers what does that mean for alexandria it has helped to keep our competitors at bay if i gave you a billion dollars and said “go buy life science assets in cambridge” you would actually have a hard time doing it the players there are not really sellers and there are no large expanses of land you can buy to build on the barriers to entry have become huge in these clusters that’s why market rents have done well and why values have done well what trends do you think will shape the future of the biotech industry i think that the products produced in our labs will continue to amaze not just me but also the entire medical community a product to help cure hepatitis c was developed in one of our labs as was the medicine that has helped many people live long lives with aids and those successes only point to labs becoming more open and collaborative the lab of the future includes a lot more space for meetings and creative collisions related content the current climate ge and the future of energyread more the green giant walmarts
