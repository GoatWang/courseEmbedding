commodities markets which subject them to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds and fixed income securities which subject them to credit risk – the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments andor repay the principal on its debt – and interest rate risk – changes in the value of a fixedincome security resulting from changes in interest rates leverage including borrowing will cause some of the fund’s underlying etfs to be more volatile than if the underlying etfs had not been leveraged the iq hedge multistrategy index is comprised solely of etfs the index does not include hedge funds as components returns presented are net of underlying etf fees but do not reflect the deduction of management

investor loans money to a corporate or government entity that borrows the funds for a specified period of time at a fixed interest rate investors typically receive interest on the bonds when they mature bond funds hold a portfolio of bonds and can differ widely in strategies ranging from us treasuries to high yields from longterm to shortterm by contract liquid alternative etfs typically hold
