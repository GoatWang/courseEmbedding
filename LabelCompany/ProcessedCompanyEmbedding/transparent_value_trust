transparency at our startup and why the reasons dont matter joel gascoigne startups life learning and happiness im cofounder and ceo at buffer this is where i share lessons im learning check out all  articles →book startup help office hours → follow me and say hello follow joelgascoigne new posts via email why we have a core value of transparency at our startup and why the reasons dont matter tweet buffer written on st september comments since the beginning of buffer weve always shared all of our learnings and failures over time this developed into a more defined goal and principle as part of the values of the company since we defined our value of transparency within the culture as default to transparency we found many things within the company that we werent being completely open about and we put them out there for the world to see weve generally found that we are sharing a lot of things which are somewhat taboo or at least unusual to be shared publicly as an example here are some of the current numbers and things we share m users have registered for buffer k users are active on a monthly basis shared at least one post we have k paying customers on the awesome or business plans annual recurring revenue arr is currently m were generating around k a month the team is  people spread all across the world we have a strong focus on culturefit and sometimes it means firing great people who have different values that means revenue per employee is around k all our saas metrics ltv churn etc can be seen at our baremetrics dashboard we share the salaries of the whole team in this spreadsheet my salary is k weve raised k in funding and investors own around  of the company why be so transparent for us transparency came quite naturally myself and leo always felt very comfortable and excited to share our learnings it helped us get more feedback about decisions and it was a way to help others who are getting started we werent always as transparent as we are today our openness grew as the company expanded we had a vision to continue becoming more open and weve been lucky to find people to join the team who encourage more openness rather than warning and being hesitant about potential downsides in the recent months ive been asked many times why we would choose to be so transparent if im completely honest its not something i had given all that much thought i think being transparent is a little like creating a startup if you focus on the downsides youll probably just never do it at the same time i wanted to have good answers and it felt responsible to give it real thought here are  benefits ive seen for transparency  transparency breeds trust one of the business books thats had a large impact on me as ive started to grow a team is the five dysfunctions of a team its a leadership fable which explains five dysfunctions that often exist in teams and how to solve them in order to become a more effective team the first of the five dysfunctions is absense of trust in the book the author describes it as follows trust is the foundation of real teamwork and so the first dysfunction is a failure on the part of team members to understand and open up to one another and if that sounds touchyfeely let me explain because there is nothing soft about it it is an absolutely critical part of building a team in fact it’s probably the most critical  patrick lencioni lencioni goes on to explain that being vulnerable amongst teammates and being comfortable having debate and conflict is critical to building trust for us weve found that transparency is another great way to build trust in a team if all the information about everything thats going on is freely available that helps everyone to feel completely on board with decisions based on my learnings from the five dysfunctions of a team i believe the following to be true about transparency in relation to trust transparency breeds trust and trust is the foundation of great teamwork this trust extends to customers readers of our blog and anyone who interacts with us on any level we believe that being open helps us to build trust and share our reasoning for the features we have our pricing what we blog about and many other choices  transparency helps with innovation as a company grows one of the interesting and exciting consequences of growing from a few founders to a  person team and beyond is that the innovation and decision making has to become distributed it is both a challenge and a joy for me that i will most likely not be the one who figures out our next biggest product improvements and innovations thats where transparency comes in as you grow and you expect your team to make the same decisions you would they need to have all the details that you have keith rabois put this really well in an article on first round capital if you want people to make the same decisions that you would make but in a more scalable way you have to give them the same information you have  keith rabois  transparency leads to greater justice another key benefit weve seen which wasnt necessarily our reason for transparency is one which whole foods cares deeply about eliminating unfairness and inequality we have a formula which determines the salaries of everyone in the team it has a number of factors such as your role experience and location as an example one factor the formula doesnt have is gender when you determine salaries in a more adhoc way or through negotation i think a lot of inequality could creep in john mackey cofounder and ceo at whole foods said that with transparency any kind of favoritism or nepotism is seen  you open yourself up to more feedback by practicing transparency weve found that we get much more feedback on our decisions for us we try to take in all that feedback and make adjustments based on it for example when we shared our salary formula we had a lot of comments from people mentioning to us that we werent paying high enough salaries for people in the san francisco bay area so we made an adjustment to the formula now were in a much better position to attract new team members in the bay area its great to get this feedback it can be a challenge weve tried to work on ourselves and grow a team which enjoys and embraces the feedback we receive as we grow the feedback has increased too which will become an interesting aspect to handle its one of the reasons we have a large customer happiness team and strive to provide great customer support in truth we dont have a reason for our transparency its just one of our principles one of the most interesting business books ive recently read is joy at work by dennis bakke bakke was the cofounder and ceo of a large us energy company called aes which reached  billion in revenues and  employees they operated in a highly unusual decentralized business model and they had a core value of fun in his book he argued that it is dangerous to tie benefits and reasons to your core values i kept saying that our values were not responsible for the runup in our share price and should not be blamed for any downturns in the future  dennis bakke bakke explained that as soon as you tie your values to performance it means that you will question them when you hit a tough patch of your journey for us we believe that transparency at its core is honesty and its a value that we want to live by no matter what it seems that it is very important that you determine good values if you choose to take this approach for example your methods should change a lot your principles or values should rarely need to be altered all that to say despite all the benefits we see those are not reasons that we are transparent they are nice side effects and there are downsides too and we are happy with both aspects id love your thoughts on our approach to transparency drop me a note in the comments and ill try to respond also if you are striving to build a company in a more transparent way too get in touch i am keen to surround myself with people who are also embarking upon this adventure photo credit farrukh did you enjoy this article i write regularly on startups my life choices

swap contracts or other derivatives as related to its respective underlying index and its component securities cash and cash equivalents other investment companies as well as in securities and other instruments not included in its underlying index but which the adviser believes will help the fund track its underlying index a fund may also engage in short sales in accordance with its investment objective  the trust may issue funds that seek to track underlying indexes constructed using  investment strategies “ funds” or other longshort investment strategies “longshort funds” each longshort fund will establish i exposures equal to approximately  of the long positions specified by the longshort index  and ii exposures equal to approximately  of the short positions specified by the longshort index each  fund will include strategies that i establish long positions in securities so that total long exposure represents approximately  of a funds net assets and ii simultaneously establish short positions in other securities so that total short exposure represents approximately  of such funds net assets each business day for each longshort fund and  fund the adviser will provide full portfolio transparency on the funds publicly available web site “web site” by making available the funds portfolio holdings defined below before the commencement of trading of shares on the listing exchange defined below the information provided on the web site will be formatted to be readerfriendly  a fund will utilize either a replication or representative sampling strategy to track its underlying index a fund using a replication strategy will invest in the component securities of its underlying index in the same approximate proportions as in such underlying index a fund using a representative sampling strategy will hold some but not necessarily all of the component securities of its underlying index applicants state that a fund using a representative sampling strategy will not be expected to track the performance of its underlying index with the same degree of accuracy as would an investment vehicle that invested in every component security of the underlying index with the same weighting as the underlying index applicants expect that each fund will have an annual tracking error relative to the performance of its underlying index of less than   each fund will be entitled to use its underlying index pursuant to either a licensing agreement with the entity that compiles creates sponsors or maintains the underlying index each an “index provider” or a sublicensing arrangement with the adviser which will have a licensing agreement with such index provider a “selfindexing fund” is a fund for which an affiliated person or a secondtier affiliate of the trust or a fund of the adviser of any subadviser to or promoter of a fund or of the distributor each an “affiliated index provider”  will serve as the index provider in the case of selfindexing funds an affiliated index provider will create a proprietary rulesbased methodology to create underlying indexes each an “affiliated index” except with respect to the selfindexing funds no index provider is or will be an affiliated person or a secondtier affiliate of the trust or a fund of the adviser of any subadviser to or promoter of a fund or of the distributor  applicants recognize that selfindexing funds could raise concerns regarding the ability of the affiliated index provider to manipulate the underlying index to the benefit or detriment of the selfindexing fund applicants further recognize the potential for conflicts that may arise with respect to the personal trading activity of personnel of the affiliated index provider who have knowledge of changes to an underlying index prior to the time that information is publicly disseminated prior orders granted to selfindexing etfs “prior selfindexing orders” addressed these concerns by creating a framework that required i transparency of the underlying indexes ii the adoption of policies and procedures not otherwise required by the act designed to mitigate such conflicts of interest iii limitations on the ability to change the rules for index compilation and the component securities of the index iv that the index provider enter into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to act as “calculation agent” and v certain limitations designed to separate employees of the index provider adviser and calculation agent clauses ii through v are hereinafter referred to as “policies and procedures”  instead of adopting the same or similar policies and procedures start printed page applicants propose that each day that a fund the nyse and the national securities exchange as defined in section a of the act an “exchange” on which the funds shares are primarily listed “listing exchange” are open for business including any day that a fund is required to be open under section e of the act a “business day” each selfindexing fund will post on its web site before commencement of trading of shares on the listing exchange the identities and quantities of the portfolio securities assets and other positions held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of its nav at the end of the business day “portfolio holdings” applicants believe that requiring selfindexing funds to maintain full portfolio transparency will provide an effective alternative mechanism for addressing any such potential conflicts of interest  applicants represent that each selfindexing funds portfolio holdings will be as transparent as the portfolio holdings of existing actively managed etfs applicants observe that the framework set forth in the prior selfindexing orders was established before the commission began issuing exemptive relief to allow the offering of activelymanaged etfs unlike passivelymanaged etfs activelymanaged etfs do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index but rather seek to achieve their investment objectives by using an “active” management strategy applicants contend that the structure of actively managed etfs presents potential conflicts of interest that are the same as those presented by selfindexing funds because the portfolio managers of an actively managed etf by definition have advance knowledge of pending portfolio changes however rather than requiring policies and procedures similar to those required under the prior selfindexing orders applicants believe that actively managed etfs address these potential conflicts of interest appropriately through full portfolio transparency as the conditions to their relevant exemptive relief require  in addition applicants do not believe the potential for conflicts of interest raised by the advisers use of the underlying indexes in connection with the management of the self indexing funds and the affiliated accounts will be substantially different from the potential conflicts presented by an adviser managing two or more registered funds both the act and the advisers act contain various protections to address conflicts of interest where an adviser is managing two or more registered funds and these protections will also help address these conflicts with respect to the selfindexing funds  the adviser and any subadviser has adopted or will adopt pursuant to rule  under the advisers act written policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the advisers act and the rules thereunder these include policies and procedures designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest among the selfindexing funds and the affiliated accounts such as cross trading policies as well as those designed to ensure the equitable allocation of portfolio transactions and brokerage commissions in addition the adviser has adopted policies and procedures as required under section a of the advisers act which are reasonably designed in light of the nature of its business to prevent the misuse in violation of the advisers act or the exchange act or the rules thereunder of material nonpublic information by the adviser or an associated person “inside information policy” any subadviser will be required to adopt and maintain a similar inside information policy in accordance with the code of ethics  and inside information policy of the adviser and subadvisers personnel of those entities with knowledge about the composition of the portfolio deposit  will be prohibited from disclosing such information to any other person except as authorized in the course of their employment until such information is made public in addition an index provider will not provide any information relating to changes to an underlying indexs methodology for the inclusion of component securities the inclusion or exclusion of specific component securities or methodology for the calculation or the return of component securities in advance of a public announcement of such changes by the index provider the adviser will also include under item c of part  of its form adv a discussion of its relationship to any affiliated index provider and any material conflicts of interest resulting therefrom regardless of whether the affiliated index provider is a type of affiliate specified in item   to the extent the selfindexing funds transact with an affiliated person of the adviser or subadviser such transactions will comply with the act the rules thereunder and the terms and conditions of the requested order in this regard each selfindexing funds board of directors or trustees “board” will periodically review the selfindexing funds use of an affiliated index provider subject to the approval of the selfindexing funds board the adviser affiliated persons of the adviser “adviser affiliates” and affiliated persons of any subadviser “subadviser affiliates” may be authorized to provide custody fund accounting and administration and transfer agency services to the selfindexing funds any services provided by the adviser adviser affiliates subadviser and subadviser affiliates will be performed in accordance with the provisions of the act the rules under the act and any relevant guidelines from the staff of the commission  in light of the foregoing applicants believe it is appropriate to allow the selfindexing funds to be fully transparent in lieu of policies and procedures from the prior selfindexing orders discussed above  the shares of each fund will be purchased and redeemed in creation units and generally on an inkind basis except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified below purchasers will be required to purchase creation units by making an inkind deposit of specified instruments “deposit instruments” and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive an inkind transfer of specified instruments “redemption instruments” on any given business start printed page day the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the deposit instruments and the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the redemption instruments will be identical unless the fund is rebalancing as defined below in addition the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the funds portfolio including cash positions  except a in the case of bonds for minor differences when it is impossible to break up bonds beyond certain minimum sizes needed for transfer and settlement b for minor differences when rounding is necessary to eliminate fractional shares or lots that are not tradeable round lots  c tba transactions short positions derivatives and other positions that cannot be transferred in kind  will be excluded from the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments  d to the extent the fund determines on a given business day to use a representative sampling of the funds portfolio  or e for temporary periods to effect changes in the funds portfolio as a result of the rebalancing of its underlying index any such change a “rebalancing” if there is a difference between the nav attributable to a creation unit and the aggregate market value of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments exchanged for the creation unit the party conveying instruments with the lower value will also pay to the other an amount in cash equal to that difference the “cash amount”  purchases and redemptions of creation units may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis rather than in kind solely under the following circumstances a to the extent there is a cash amount b if on a given business day the fund announces before the open of trading that all purchases all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash c if upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an authorized participant the fund determines to require the purchase or redemption as applicable to be made entirely in cash  d if on a given business day the fund requires all authorized participants purchasing or redeeming shares on that day to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are not eligible for transfer through either the nscc or dtc defined below or ii in the case of foreign funds holding nonus investments such instruments are not eligible for trading due to local trading restrictions local restrictions on securities transfers or other similar circumstances or e if the fund permits an authorized participant to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are in the case of the purchase of a creation unit not available in sufficient quantity ii such instruments are not eligible for trading by an authorized participant or the investor on whose behalf the authorized participant is acting or iii a holder of shares of a foreign fund holding nonus investments would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind  creation units will consist of specified large aggregations of shares eg at least  shares and it is expected that the initial price of a creation unit will range from  million to  million all orders to purchase creation units must be placed with the distributor by or through an “authorized participant” which is either  a “participating party” ie a brokerdealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the nscc a clearing agency registered with the commission or  a participant in the depository trust company “dtc” “dtc participant” which in either case has signed a participant agreement with the distributor the distributor will be responsible for transmitting the orders to the funds and will furnish to those placing such orders confirmation that the orders have been accepted but applicants state that the distributor may reject any order which is not submitted in proper form  each business day before the open of trading on the listing exchange each fund will cause to be published through the nscc the names and quantities of the instruments comprising the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments as well as the estimated cash amount if any for that day the list of deposit instruments and redemption instruments will apply until a new list is announced on the following business day and there will be no intraday changes to the list except to correct errors in the published list each listing exchange will disseminate every  seconds during regular exchange trading hours through the facilities of the consolidated tape association an amount for each fund stated on a per individual share basis representing the sum of i the estimated cash amount and ii the current value of the portfolio securities and other assets of the fund  transaction expenses including operational processing and brokerage costs will be incurred by a fund when investors purchase or redeem creation units inkind and such costs have the potential to dilute the interests of the funds existing shareholders each fund will impose purchase or redemption transaction fees “transaction fees” in connection with effecting such purchases or redemptions of creation units in all cases such transaction fees will be limited in accordance with requirements of the commission applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities since the transaction fees are intended to defray the transaction expenses as well as to prevent possible shareholder dilution resulting from the purchase or redemption of creation units the transaction fees will be borne only by start printed page such purchasers or redeemers the distributor will be responsible for delivering the funds prospectus to those persons acquiring shares in creation units and for maintaining records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it in addition the distributor will maintain a record of the instructions given to the applicable fund to implement the delivery of its shares  shares of each fund will be listed and traded individually on an exchange it is expected that one or more member firms of an exchange will be designated to act as a market maker each a “market maker” and maintain a market for shares trading on the exchange prices of shares trading on an exchange will be based on the current bidoffer market transactions involving the sale of shares on an exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional investors and arbitrageurs market makers acting in their roles to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for the shares may from time to time find it appropriate to purchase or redeem creation units applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional and retail investors the price at which shares trade will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the option continually to purchase or redeem shares in creation units which should help prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav  shares will not be individually redeemable and owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only to redeem an investor must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit redemption requests must be placed through an authorized participant a redeeming investor may pay a transaction fee calculated in the same manner as a transaction fee payable in connection with purchases of creation units  neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised or marketed or otherwise held out as a traditional openend investment company or a “mutual fund” instead each such fund will be marketed as an “etf” all marketing materials that describe the features or method of obtaining buying or selling creation units or shares traded on an exchange or refer to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and will disclose that the owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only the funds will provide copies of their annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial owners of shares applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act under section dj of the act for an exemption from sections da and b of the act and under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the owner upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the funds to register as openend management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units and redeem creation units from each fund applicants further state that because creation units may always be purchased and redeemed at nav the price of shares on the secondary market should not vary materially from nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through an underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in a funds prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c ensure an orderly distribution of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption pricestart printed page   applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve a fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the price at which shares trade will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the option continually to purchase or redeem shares in creation units which should help prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav section e  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants state that settlement of redemptions for foreign funds will be contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the united states market but also on current delivery cycles in local markets for underlying foreign portfolio securities held by a foreign fund applicants state that the delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring redemption instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules may require a delivery process of up to fifteen  calendar days accordingly with respect to foreign funds only applicants hereby request relief under section c from the requirement imposed by section e to allow foreign funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen  calendar days following the tender of creation units for redemption  applicants believe that congress adopted section e to prevent unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants propose that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a foreign fund to be made within fifteen calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants suggest that a redemption payment occurring within fifteen calendar days following a redemption request would adequately afford investor protection  applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to foreign funds that do not effect creations and redemptions of creation units inkind section d  section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring securities of an investment company if such securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter and any other brokerdealer from knowingly selling the investment companys shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  applicants request an exemption to permit registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts “uits” that are not advised or sponsored by the adviser and not part of the same “group of investment companies” as defined in section dgii of the act as the funds such management investment companies are referred to as “investing management companies” such uits are referred to as “investing trusts” and investing management companies and investing trusts are collectively referred to as “funds of funds” to acquire shares beyond the limits of section da of the act and the funds and any principal underwriter for the funds andor any broker registered exchange act to sell shares to funds of funds beyond the limits of section db of the act  each investing management company will be advised by an investment adviser within the meaning of section aa of the act the “fund of funds adviser” and may be subadvised by investment advisers within the meaning of section ab of the act each a “fund of funds subadviser” any investment adviser to an investing management company will be registered under the advisers act each investing trust will be sponsored by a sponsor “sponsor”  applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief adequately address the concerns underlying the limits in sections da and b which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds excessive layering of fees and overly complex fund structures applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  applicants believe that neither a fund of funds nor a fund of funds affiliate would be able to exert undue influence over a fund to limit the control that a fund of funds may have over a fund applicants propose a condition prohibiting a fund of funds adviser or sponsor any person controlling controlled by or under common control with a fund of funds adviser or sponsor and any investment company and any issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act that is advised or sponsored by a fund of funds adviser or sponsor or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with a fund of funds adviser or sponsor “fund of funds advisory group” from controlling individually or in the aggregate a fund within the meaning of section a of the act the same prohibition would apply to any fund of funds subadviser any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the fund of funds subadviser and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act or portion of such investment company or issuer advised or sponsored by the fund of funds subadviser or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the fund of funds subadviser “fund of funds subadvisory group”  applicants propose other conditions to limit the potential for start printed page undue influence over the funds including that no fund of funds or fund of funds affiliate except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a fund will cause a fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an underwriting affiliate “affiliated underwriting” an “underwriting affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor of the fund of funds or a person of which any such officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser or fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor is an affiliated person except that any person whose relationship to the fund is covered by section f of the act is not an underwriting affiliate  applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees the board of directors or trustees of any investing management company including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act “disinterested directors or trustees” will find that the advisory fees charged under the contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to rather than duplicative of services provided under the advisory contract of any fund in which the investing management company may invest in addition under condition b a fund of funds adviser or a fund of funds trustee or sponsor as applicable will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the fund of funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a fund under rule b under the act received from a fund by the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or an affiliated person of the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor other than any advisory fees paid to the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or its affiliated person by a fund in connection with the investment by the fund of funds in the fund applicants state that any sales charges andor service fees charged with respect to shares of a fund of funds will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds as set forth in nasd conduct rule   applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure applicants note that no fund will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes to ensure a fund of funds is aware of the terms and conditions of the requested order the fund of funds will enter into an agreement with the fund “fof participation agreement” the fof participation agreement will include an acknowledgement from the fund of funds that it may rely on the order only to invest in the funds and not in any other investment company  applicants also note that a fund may choose to reject a direct purchase of shares in creation units by a fund of funds to the extent that a fund of funds purchases shares in the secondary market a fund would still retain its ability to reject any initial investment by a fund of funds in excess of the limits of section da by declining to enter into a fof participation agreement with the fund of funds sections a and  of the act  sections a and  of the act generally prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” of another person to include a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person b any person  or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with the power to vote by the other person and c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company and provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than  of a companys voting securities the funds may be deemed to be controlled by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other in addition the funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by an adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with an adviser an “affiliated fund” any investor including market makers owning  or holding in excess of  of the trust or such funds may be deemed affiliated persons of the trust or such funds in addition an investor could own  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more affiliated funds making that investor a secondtier affiliate of the funds  applicants request an exemption from sections a and a of the act pursuant to sections c and b of the act to permit persons that are affiliated persons of the funds or secondtier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds b an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in a or c holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more affiliated funds to effectuate purchases and redemptions “inkind”  applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting such affiliated persons from making “inkind” purchases or “inkind” redemptions of shares of a fund in creation units both the deposit procedures for “inkind” purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for “inkind” redemptions of creation units will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions regardless of size or number there will be no discrimination between purchasers or redeemers deposit instruments and redemption instruments for each fund will be valued in the identical manner as those portfolio securities currently held by such fund and the valuation of the deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be made in an identical manner regardless of the identity of the purchaser or redeemer applicants do not believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching but rather assert that such procedures will be implemented consistently with each funds objectives and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will be made on terms reasonable to applicants and any affiliated persons because they will be valued pursuant to verifiable objective standards the method of valuing start printed page portfolio securities held by a fund is identical to that used for calculating “inkind” purchase or redemption values and therefore creates no opportunity for affiliated persons or secondtier affiliates of applicants to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of shares of that fund similarly applicants submit that by using the same standards for valuing portfolio securities held by a fund as are used for calculating “inkind” redemptions or purchases the fund will ensure that its nav will not be adversely affected by such securities transactions applicants also note that the ability to take deposits and make redemptions “inkind” will help each fund to track closely its underlying index and therefore aid in achieving the funds objectives  applicants also seek relief under sections c and b from section a to permit a fund that is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of a fund of funds to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds and to engage in the accompanying inkind transactions with the fund of funds applicants state that the terms of the transactions are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching applicants note that any consideration paid by a fund of funds for the purchase or redemption of shares directly from a fund will be based on the nav of the fund applicants believe that any proposed transactions directly between the funds and funds of funds will be consistent with the policies of each fund of funds the purchase of creation units by a fund of funds directly from a fund will be accomplished in accordance with the investment restrictions of any such fund of funds and will be consistent with the investment policies set forth in the fund of funds registration statement applicants also state that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the act and are appropriate in the public interest applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions a etf relief  the requested relief to permit etf operations will expire on the effective date of any commission rule under the

more from the may  issue explore the archive executive summary with the help of technology companies today sweep up huge amounts of customer data but they tend to be opaque about the information they collect and often resell which leaves their customers feeling uneasy though that practice may give firms an edge in the short term in the long run it undermines consumers’ trust which in turn hurts competitiveness say authors morey forbath and schoop in this article the three share the results of a survey of  people across five countries which looked at attitudes about data privacy and security it examined what people knew about the information trails they leave online which organizations they did—and did not—trust with their data and which data they valued the most the results show that the value consumers place on different data depends a lot on what it is and how it is used in general the perceived value rises as the data’s breadth and sensitivity increases from basic voluntarily shared information to detailed predictive profiles that firms create through analytics and as its uses shift from benefiting the consumer to benefiting the company if data is used to improve a product consumers generally feel the enhancement itself is a fair trade but they expect more in return for data used to target marketing and the most in return for data sold to third parties to build trust companies must be transparent about the data they gather and offer consumers appropriate value in exchange for it simple legal disclosures aren’t enough however companies must actively educate their customers and incorporate fairness into their products and models from the start companies that get this will win consumers’ goodwill and business and continued access to their data companies that don’t will find themselves at a serious disadvantage and maybe even shut out hbr reprint rh idea in brief the problem though consumers worry about how their personal data is gathered and used they’re surprisingly ignorant of what data they reveal when they’re online and most companies opt not to enlighten them this dynamic erodes trust in firms and customers’ willingness to share information the solution companies need to design products and services with transparency and data privacy in mind they must provide customers with appropriate value in exchange for data educate them about how it is collected and allow them to have control over it best practice disney devised electronic wristbands that give park visitors access to attractions and hotel rooms and allow them to charge food disney uses the bands to collect data on customers but clearly spells out its practices and privacy policies the tradeoffs are transparent to the customers who find the convenience and other benefits the bands offer worthwhile with the explosion of digital technologies companies are sweeping up vast quantities of data about consumers’ activities both online and off feeding this trend are new smart connected products—from fitness trackers to home systems—that gather and transmit detailed information though some companies are open about their data practices most prefer to keep consumers in the dark choose control over sharing and ask for forgiveness rather than permission it’s also not unusual for companies to quietly collect personal data they have no immediate use for reasoning that it might be valuable someday as current and former executives at frog a firm that helps clients create products and services that leverage users’ personal data we believe this shrouded approach to data gathering is shortsighted having free use of customer data may confer nearterm advantages but our research shows that consumers are aware that they’re under surveillance—even though they may be poorly informed about the specific types of data collected about them—and are deeply anxious about how their personal information may be used further reading with big data comes big responsibility security  privacy magazine article harvard business review staff save share in a future in which customer data will be a growing source of competitive advantage gaining consumers’ confidence will be key companies that are transparent about the information they gather give customers control of their personal data and offer fair value in return for it will be trusted and will earn ongoing and even expanded access those that conceal how they use personal data and fail to provide value for it stand to lose customers’ goodwill—and their business the expanding scope of data the internet’s first personal data collectors were websites and applications by tracking users’ activities online marketers could deliver targeted advertising and content more recently intelligent technology in physical products has allowed companies in many industries to collect new types of information including users’ locations and behavior the personalization this data allows such as constant adaptation to users’ preferences has become central to the product experience google’s nest thermostat for example autonomously adjusts heating and cooling as it learns home owners’ habits the rich new streams of data have also made it possible to tackle complex challenges in fields such as health care environmental protection and urban planning take medtronic’s digital bloodglucose meter it wirelessly connects an implanted sensor to a device that alerts patients and health care providers that bloodglucose levels are nearing troubling thresholds allowing preemptive treatments and the car service uber has recently agreed to share ridepattern data with boston officials so that the city can improve transportation planning and prioritize road maintenance these and countless other applications are increasing the power—and value—of personal data of course this flood of data presents enormous opportunities for abuse largescale security breaches such as the recent theft of the credit card information of  million home depot customers expose consumers’ vulnerability to malicious agents but revelations about companies’ covert activities also make consumers nervous target famously aroused alarm when it was revealed that the retailer used data mining to identify shoppers who were likely to be pregnant—in some cases before they’d told anyone at the same time consumers appreciate that data sharing can lead to products and services that make their lives easier and more entertaining educate them and save them money neither companies nor their customers want to turn back the clock on these technologies—and indeed the development and adoption of products that leverage personal data continue to soar the consultancy gartner estimates that nearly  billion connected “things” will be in use in —up  from —and that the number will quintuple by  resolving this tension will require companies and policy makers to move the data privacy discussion beyond advertising use and the simplistic notion that aggressive data collection is bad we believe the answer is more nuanced guidance—specifically guidelines that align the interests of companies and their customers and ensure that both parties benefit from personal data collection consumer awareness and expectations to help companies understand consumers’ attitudes about data in  we surveyed  people in five countries—the united states the united kingdom germany china and india—whose demographic mix represented the general online population we looked at their awareness of how their data was collected and used how they valued different types of data their feelings about privacy and what they expected in return for their data to find out whether consumers grasped what data they shared we asked “to the best of your knowledge what personal information have you put online yourself either directly or indirectly by your use of online services” while awareness varied by country—indians are the most cognizant of their data trail and germans the least—overall the survey revealed an astonishingly low recognition of the specific types of information tracked online on average only  of people knew that their data footprints included information on their location and just  understood that they were sharing their websurfing history too further reading if customers knew how you use their data would they call it creepy customers online article sara m watson don’t risk a privacy backlash save share it’s not as if consumers don’t realize that data about them is being captured however  of the people surveyed expressed concern that businesses and the government might misuse their data identity theft was a top concern cited by  of chinese respondents at one end of the spectrum and  of indians at the other privacy issues also ranked high  of germans and  of americans are reluctant to share information with businesses because they “just want to maintain their privacy” so consumers clearly worry about their personal data—even if they don’t know exactly what they’re revealing to see how much consumers valued their data we did conjoint analysis to determine what amount survey participants would be willing to pay to protect different types of information we used purchasing parity rather than exchange rates to convert all amounts to us dollars though the value assigned varied widely among individuals we are able to determine in effect a median by country for each data type the responses revealed significant differences from country to country and from one type of data to another germans for instance place the most value on their personal data and chinese and indians the least with british and american respondents falling in the middle government identification health and credit card information tended to be the most highly valued across countries and location and demographic information among the least we don’t believe this spectrum represents a “maturity model” in which attitudes in a country predictably shift in a given direction over time say from less privacy conscious to more rather our findings reflect fundamental dissimilarities among cultures the cultures of india and china for example are considered more hierarchical and collectivist while germany the united states and the united kingdom are more individualistic which may account for their citizens’ stronger feelings about personal information the need to deliver value if companies understand how much data is worth to consumers they can offer commensurate value in return for it making the exchange transparent will be increasingly important in building trust a lot depends on the type of data and how the firm is going to use it our analysis looked at three categories  selfreported data or information people volunteer about themselves such as their email addresses work and educational history and age and gender  digital exhaust such as location data and browsing history which is created when using mobile devices web services or other connected technologies and  profiling data or personal profiles used to make predictions about individuals’ interests and behaviors which are derived by combining selfreported digital exhaust and other data our research shows that people value selfreported data the least digital exhaust more and profiling data the most we also examined three categories of data use  making a product or service better for example by allowing a map application to recommend a route based on a user’s location  facilitating targeted marketing or advertising such as ads based on a user’s browsing history and  generating revenues through resale by say selling credit card purchase data to third parties find this and other hbr graphics in our  visual library   our surveys reveal that when data is used to improve a product or service consumers generally feel the enhancement itself is a fair trade for their data but consumers expect more value in return for data used to target marketing and the most value for data that will be sold to third parties in other words the value consumers place on their data rises as its sensitivity and breadth increase from basic information that is voluntarily shared to detailed information about the consumer that the firm derives through analytics and as its uses go from principally benefiting the consumer in the form of product improvements to principally benefiting the firm in the form of revenues from selling data let’s look now at how some companies manage this tradeoff samsung’s galaxy v smartphone uses digital exhaust to automatically add the contacts users call most to a favorites list most customers value the convenience enough to opt in to the feature—effectively agreeing to swap data for enhanced performance google’s predictive application google now harnesses profiling data to create an automated virtual assistant for consumers by sifting through users’ email location calendar and other data google now can say notify users when they need to leave the office to get across town for a meeting and provide a map for their commute the app depends on morevaluable types of personal data but improves performance enough that many users willingly share it our global survey of consumers’ attitudes toward predictive applications finds that about twothirds of people are willing and in some cases eager to share data in exchange for their benefits disney likewise uses profiling data gathered by its magicband bracelet to enhance customers’ theme park and hotel experiences and create targeted marketing by holding the magicband up to sensors around disney facilities wearers can access parks check in at reserved attractions unlock their hotel doors and charge food and merchandise users hand over a lot of data but they get convenience and a sense of privileged access in return making the tradeoff worthwhile consumers know exactly what they’re signing on for because disney clearly spells out its data collection policies in its online magicband registration process highlighting links to faqs and other information about privacy and security data laws are growing fiercer in a landmark case in september  germany ordered google to stop violating its federal telemedia act and federal data protection act under fire was google’s practice of compiling individual user data from its various services into detailed user profiles without users’ consent google was already facing fines from six other european countries for breaking the european union’s rules on privacy but germany’s decision to force the company to change its practices to comply with the country’s particular data protection laws set a new precedent among the list of required measures was a directive that google meet germany’s stringent privacy options in particular providing a “right to forget” service through which people could remove any personal information they did not want online this marked a new era for global webbased businesses as the new york times has reported many countries now default to europe’s data protection rules adopting passages from the eu’s strict regulations almost word for word at the same time they add regional legal interpretations brazil requires that tech companies get direct permission from users before sharing their data with online advertisers and marketers south africa forbids the transmission of people’s personal data to countries that don’t replicate its privacy laws and south korea grants individuals the right to access at any time the online information that companies hold about them the united states is exceptional in that its personal data laws are not clearly defined and not enforced by any independent governing body except in the case of data related to health care or minors however as google’s experiences show usbased companies that operate internationally may be forced to comply with morestringent data laws elsewhere firms that sell personal information to third parties however have a particularly high bar to clear because consumers expect the most value for such use of their data the personal finance website mint makes this elegant exchange if a customer uses a credit card abroad and incurs foreign transaction fees mint flags the fees and refers the customer to a card that doesn’t charge them mint receives a commission for the referral from the newcard issuer and the customer avoids future fees mint and its customers both collect value from the deal trust and transparency firms may earn access to consumers’ data by offering value in return but trust is an essential facilitator our research shows the more trusted a brand is the more willing consumers are to share their data numerous studies have found that transparency about the use and protection of consumers’ data reinforces trust to assess this effect ourselves we surveyed consumers about  companies representing seven categories of business around the world we asked them to rate the firms on the following scale completely trustworthy respondents would freely share sensitive personal data with a firm because they trust the firm not to misuse it trustworthy they would “not mind” exchanging sensitive data for a desired service untrustworthy they would provide sensitive data only if required to do so in exchange for an essential service and completely untrustworthy they would never share sensitive data with the firm after primary care doctors new finance firms such as paypal and china’s alipay received the highest ratings on this scale followed by ecommerce companies consumer electronics makers banks and insurance companies and telecommunications carriers next came internet leaders such as google and yahoo and the government ranked below these organizations were retailers and entertainment companies with social networks like facebook coming in last a firm that is considered untrustworthy will find it difficult or impossible to collect certain types of data regardless of the value offered in exchange highly trusted firms on the other hand may be able to collect it simply by asking because customers are satisfied with past benefits received and confident the company will guard their data in practical terms this means that if two firms offer the same value in exchange for certain data the firm with the higher trust will find customers more willing to share for example if amazon and facebook both wanted to launch a mobile wallet service amazon which received good ratings in our survey would meet with more customer acceptance than facebook which had low ratings in this equation trust could be an important competitive differentiator for amazon approaches that build trust many have argued that the extensive data collection today’s business models rely on is fraught with security financial and brand risks mit’s sandy pentland and others have proposed principles and practices that would give consumers a clear view of their data and control over its use reducing firms’ risks in the process see “with big data comes big responsibility” hbr november  we agree that these business models are perilous and that risk reduction is essential and we believe reasoned policies governing data use are important but firms must also take the lead in educating consumers about their personal data any firm that thinks it’s sufficient to simply provide disclosures in an enduser licensing agreement or present the terms and conditions of data use at signup is missing the point such moves may address regulatory requirements but they do little if anything to help consumers consider the belated trustbuilding efforts under way at facebook the firm has been accused of riding roughshod over user privacy in the past launching services that pushed the boundaries on personal data use and retreating only in the face of public backlash or the threat of litigation facebook beacon which exposed users’ web activities without their permission or knowledge for example was pulled only after a barrage of public criticism more recently however facebook has increased its focus on safeguarding privacy educating users and giving them control it grasps that trust is no longer just “nice to have” commenting in a wired interview on plans to improve facebook login which allows users to log into thirdparty apps with their facebook credentials ceo mark zuckerberg explained that “to get to the next level and become more ubiquitous facebook login needs to be trusted even more we’re a bigger company now and people have more questions we need to give people more control over their information so that everyone feels comfortable using these products” in january  facebook launched privacy basics an easytounderstand site that explains what others see about a user and how people can customize and manage others’ activities on their pages like facebook apple has had its share of data privacy and security challenges—most recently when celebrity iphoto accounts were hacked—and is taking those concerns ever more seriously particularly as apple forays into mobile payments and watchbased fitness monitoring consumer trust in its data handling will be paramount ceo tim cook clearly understands this launching a “bid to be conspicuously transparent” as the telegraph put it apple recently introduced a new section on its website devoted to data security and privacy at the top is a message from cook “at apple your trust means everything to us” he writes “that’s why we respect your privacy and protect it with strong encryption plus strict policies that govern how all data is handled…we believe in telling you up front exactly what’s going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us” using humor to teach about data privacy britain’s channel  does an excellent job of educating its viewers about its data collection and privacy policy on a dedicated website the tv station details the type of information gathered and how it’s used and summarizes the policy in a short entertaining video with comedian alan carr as he deadpans “we’ll ask you for your name email and a few other details now i know what you’re thinking why should you give us your name and insideleg measurement what will we do with that information” he then explains that viewers maintain complete control of their data that it will never be sold and that it can be erased from the system at their request at any time the video which has been watched millions of times is one component of channel ’s vigorous viewer promise program according to steven forde the channel’s director of viewer relationship management these efforts have built trust and encouraged data sharing eleven million viewers have registered on the site eighty percent of them volunteer their address details though they’re not required to and fewer than  opt out of targeted advertising wwwchannelcomviewersviewerpromiseourpromise on the site apple describes the steps taken to keep people’s location communication browsing health tracking and transactions private cook explains “our business model is very straightforward we sell great products we don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers we don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iphone or in icloud and we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you our software and services are designed to make our devices better plain and simple” its new stance earned apple the highest possible score—six stars—from the nonprofit digital rights organization electronic frontier foundation a major improvement over its  score of one star enlightened data principles facebook and apple are taking steps in the right direction but are fixing issues that shouldn’t have arisen in the first place firms in that situation start the trustbuilding process with a handicap forwardlooking companies in contrast are incorporating data privacy and security considerations into product development from the start following three principles the examples below each highlight one principle but ideally companies should practice all three teach your customers users can’t trust you if they don’t understand what you’re up to consider how one of our clients educates consumers about its use of highly sensitive personal data this client an information exchange for biomedical researchers compiles genomic data on anonymous participants from the general public like all health information such data is highly sensitive and closely guarded building trust with participants at the outset is essential so the project has made education and informed consent central to their experience before receiving a kit for collecting a saliva sample for analysis volunteers must watch a video about the potential consequences of having their genome sequenced—including the possibility of discrimination in employment and insurance—and after viewing it must give a preliminary online consent to the process the kit contains a more detailed hardcopy agreement that once signed and returned with the sample allows the exchange to include the participant’s anonymized genomic information in the database if a participant returns the sample without the signed consent her data is withheld from the exchange participants can change their minds at any time revoking or granting access to their data give them control the principle of building control into data exchange is even more fully developed in another project the metadistretti emonitor a collaboration between frog flextronics the university politecnico di milano and other partners participating cardiac patients wear an emonitor which collects ecg data and transmits it via smartphone to medical professionals and other caregivers the patients see all their own data and control how much data goes to whom using a browser and an app they can set up networks of health care providers of family and friends or of fellow users and patients and send each different information this patientdirected approach is a radical departure from the tradition of paternalistic medicine that carries over to many medical devices even today with which the patient doesn’t own his data or even have access to it deliver inkind value businesses needn’t pay users for data in fact our research suggests that offers to do so actually reduce consumers’ trust but as we’ve discussed firms do have to give users value in return the music service pandora was built on this principle pandora transparently gathers selfreported data customers volunteer their age gender and zip code when they sign up and as they use the service they tag the songs they like or don’t like pandora takes that information and develops a profile of each person’s musical tastes so that it can tailor the selection of songs streamed to him or her the more data users provide the better the tailoring becomes in the free version of its service pandora uses that data to target advertising customers get music they enjoy at no charge and ads that are more relevant to them consumers clearly find the trade satisfactory the free service has  million active subscribers in designing its service pandora understood that customers are most willing to share data when they know what value they’ll receive in return it’s hard to set up this exchange gracefully but one effective approach is to start slowly asking for a few pieces of lowvalue data that can be used to improve a service provided that there’s a clear link between the data collected and the enhancements delivered customers will become more comfortable sharing additional data as they grow more familiar with the service if your company still needs another reason to pursue the data principles we’ve described consider this countries around the world are clamping down on businesses’ freewheeling approach to personal data see the sidebar “data laws are growing fiercer” there is an opportunity for companies in this defining moment they can abide by local rules only as required or they can help lead the change under way grudging and minimal compliance may keep a firm out of trouble but will do little to gain consumers’ trust—and may even undermine it voluntarily identifying and adopting the most stringent data privacy policies will inoculate a firm against legal challenges and send consumers an important message that helps confer
