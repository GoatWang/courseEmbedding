qualityadjusted lifeyear gained   per lifeyear gained results were robust to reasonable changes in individual variables but were sensitive to the level of annual healthcare costs caused by noncardiac

increase outofpocket spending for enrollees and in some cases cause millions of seniors not to enroll in the program and to be left without coverage to achieve substantial cost savings without causing

federal government needs to make wellinformed decisions about its role and the ways that federal policy toward research and development should respond to scientific advances technology trends and changes in the political and social environment the principal justification for government support of research rests upon economic characteristics that lead private markets to provide inappropriate levels of research support or to supply inappropriate quantities of the products that result from research the federal government has two basic tools for dealing with these problems direct subsidies for research and strengthened property rights that can increase the revenues that companies receive for the products that result from research in the coming years the delivery system for health care

individualized dietary treatment is somewhat cheaper but relatively ineffective another consequence of the low chd risk in young adults is the greater likelihood that intervention may have harmful effects that outweight the benefits metaanalysis of primary prevention trials in middleaged men reveal an increase in nonchd deaths among those randomized to cholesterol interventions an unexpected finding that is more substantial than the decrease in chd deaths this raises the possibility that one or more of the cholesterol interventions could have very serious adverse effects among young

costeffective nor does it satisfy ethical standards requiring strong evidence that preventive interventions do more good than harm fortunately cholesterol screening in young adults is also not necessary most chd events associated with high blood cholesterol levels in this population will not occur for decades and can be prevented by treatment that is begun in middle age cholesterol

estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published metaanalyses the costeffectiveness of screening was addressed by formal mathematical modeling of the effect of screening on various us populations results of analysis hypertension is clearly a significant health problem it can be detected early and effective treatment is available screening asymptomatic adults for hypertension has benefits that compare favorably to the risks and costs involved according to our estimates screening is most costeffective for older adults compared with younger adults and for men compared with women and is highly sensitive to the cost of therapy for mild hypertensionwe recommend hypertension screening for all adults we also discuss the frequency and setting of screening activities when a lowcost therapy is used the costeffectiveness of screening for hypertension compares favorably with other cardiovascular interventions view details for web of science id ack view details for pubmedid  new

screening for coronary artery diseasea manual search of the englishlanguage literature using index medicus  and a bibliographic review of identified articleswe found  articles that described longterm survival of healthy individuals who either had had an abnormal finding on a resting ecg or had not had an abnormal findingwe pooled the pertinent studies and calculated the relative risk for coronary artery disease if an ecg finding was present and the  confidence limits ci on the relative risk results of analysis one reason for doing a screening scg is to detect disease whose effects can be prevented by early treatment in population studies of healthy middleaged men frequent ventricular premature beats left axis deviation left ventricular hypertrophy ecglvh and changes indicative of myocardial ischemia are all associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of dying from coronary artery disease there is no evidence that early detection of these findings leads to a clinical intervention that improves health outcomes a screening ecg can also serve as a baseline tracing two studies have shown that the baseline tracing has little effect on decision making in the emergency roomthe evidence does not support doing a screening ecg in men without evidence of cardiac disease or cardiovascular risk factors view details for web of science id aaq view

review of the epidemiologic and clinical literature we have developed recommendations for using the serum cholesterol test as a component of strategies to prevent coronary heart disease in asymptomatic adults total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein and lowdensity lipoprotein levels are risk factors for coronary disease and early mortality in middleaged men weaker evidence suggests that hypercholesterolemia increases the risk for coronary disease in women or elderly men or that hypertriglyceridemia increases the risk in men or women a reduction in cholesterol levels lowers the incidence of and the mortality from coronary disease in asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic middleaged men but has not been shown to reduce overall mortality the efficacy of treatment in women and elderly persons has not been studied screening and treatment plans should be individualized a year period between tests is adequate for asymptomatic lowrisk men whereas more frequent testing is

coronaryartery disease annals of internal medicine sox h c littenberg b garber a m     abstract to predict the effects of using exercise testing to screen healthy persons for coronary artery diseasethe publications of the coronary artery surgery study were the principal sources of data for the costeffectiveness analysis we also used data from the veterans administration cooperative study of stable angina and the publications of the european coronary surgery study groupwe used studies that provided the data that our decision model requiredlife expectancy and probabilities of outcomes in persons who have or do not have coronary artery diseasewe did not use a structured method for abstracting data we tested the susceptibility of our conclusions to poor quality of data by substituting a wide range of values for a variable in the decision model and by calculating life expectancy and costs if screening was used routinely or not usedwe assumed that persons with an abnormal exercise test would have arteriography and that persons with severe coronary artery disease would have bypass surgery when there were no suitable published data for the model we made assumptions that favored screening the model predicts that screening would increase the life expectancy of yearold men at average risk by at most  days sixtyyearold men with no risk factors for coronary artery disease would derive less benefit as would women and younger menthe effect of exercise testing is too small to justify doing this procedure routinely in healthy persons if coronary bypass surgery is found to prolong life in asymptomatic persons as much as it does in angina pectoris screening older men with risk factors for coronary artery disease may prove to be worthwhile view

patient characteristics p less than  the difference was particularly large for patients in the highdeathrisk category comparison of a matched sample of  pairs of admissions from the highdeathrisk category confirmed the above results with respect to costs and inhospital mortality but followup revealed that the survival rates were equal for the two services at nine months after discharge the effect of prospective payment on the cost of care will be closely watched we conclude that is will also be important to monitor the effect on outcomes including hospital mortality rates view details
