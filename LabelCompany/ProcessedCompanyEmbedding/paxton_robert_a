high demand for an extremely popular product resulted in higher volume production for a north carolina craft brewery growth brought new challenges however since increased throughput made a bottle drying system necessary  the paxton power dry drying system with adjustable spyder manifold helped remove water at faster bottling speeds the paxton system also resolved moisture problems created by humid weather  after comparison shopping the brewery’s facility manager concluded that paxton products was the most cost effective drying solution beating compressed air and other drying technologies handsdown doughnut conveying a food manufacturer prepares doughnuts by sending them through a production line in a bath of oil to cook properly the doughnuts need must be conveyed in the oil over  feet currently the company uses four ” lengths of pipe with  holes drilled in each pipe spanning the width of the fryer each pipe is supplied with  psi of compressed air in order to convey doughnuts across the foot span using a total of  cfm of air the manufacturer seeks to increase energy efficiency by switching to a blowerdriven system paxton proposed an air delivery system comprised of four ” air knives powered by a hp blower providing  cfm at ” of water column the paxton system will consume  hp compared to the  hp required for the compressed air the client’s return on investment will be less than  months thereafter they will save  per year wire blow off a wire manufacturer located in india is having issues with a cleaning solution adhering to the wire and ending up on the final rolled product  not only does this cause quality issues but the cost of the lost cleaning solution is expensive  they have improvised a crude system of crimped pipes and compressed air along with mechanical wipers to reduce the “carry over” of the solution  the compressed air nozzles they use require approximately  cfm   psi  their improved solution carries a high price tag in energy costs requiring  hp of compressed air the compressed air also takes a toll on air pressure in the plant causing their compressor to run continuously this in turn drives up their maintenance costs and it puts on strain on the rest of the plant’s operations paxton will engineer a system that delivers  cfm   psi  that will have an estimated roi of around  years based on energy savings alone in addition to this the wire manufacturer will save money due to reduced compressed air expense conveyor cleaning gypsum removal an electric power company wants to remove residual gypsum from their conveyors after the bulk of the gypsum has unloaded gypsum is a byproduct of the cleancoal burning process and is usually sent to a landfill if it cannot be used  recently a drywall manufacturer built a facility nearby and will use this gypsum as feedstock  by installing a blower system to blow the residual off the conveyor the customer will be able to collect the gypsum increase revenue and reduce the amount of gypsum deposited into landfills paxton will supply a ” length dual plenum air knife with two hp at  blowers  each blower will supply  cfm  ” of wc conveyor blow off metal shavings a midwestern machining company needs to blow metal chips off of their conveyor after a machining process they have three lines and are currently using one ” and one ” compressed air knife on each line operating at  psi to remove the chips from the conveyor giving a total compressed air usage of  cfm they would like to switch to blowerdriven air in order to reduce energy consumption for the paxton air systems for each line a  hp blower will supply two ” air knives providing  cfm at ” of water column the paxton systems will each use  hp compared to the  hp for each of the existing compressed air systems a savings of over  hp per line along with the energy savings the company is able to free up almost  hp  x  hp on their compressor for operations that require compressed air operation metal tube drying preprint a midwestern metal tube manufacturer must dry large metal tubes ranging in diameter from ” –” before printing  they are currently drying the tubes using four ” fan nozzles with  psi compressed air but are occasionally having quality issues despite the use of  cfm of air  they would like to switch to blowerdriven air for the energy savings while improving the quality of the drying for the paxton air system a  hp blower will supply three ’ air knives providing  cfm air at ” of water column   the paxton system will use only  hp compared to  hp for the existing compressed air system resulting in an energy savings of about  per hour and yielding an roi of less than  months for a  x  day operation part drying for injection molding a west coast metal injection moldingdie casting company needed to blow off various products after rinsing they have  lines in the facility using two ” air knives each of unregulated compressed air at plant pressure  psi consuming  cfm they would like to replace their compressed air drying application with an energy efficient solution that provides an roi of  months or less the paxton solution utilizes a  hp xt blower with two ” aluminum air knives which will provide the line with  cfm at ” water column each line of compressed air replaced with a paxton system will free up approximately  hp of their existing compressed air system the system will have a washdown enclosure so the system can be put right next to the washdown area of each line the roi of the project is less than  months soda can rinsing a major beverage manufacturer in droughtridden california was looking to replace its water rinsing system prior to the filler with one of paxton’s ionizing can rinser systems the system provided needed to be able to rinse up to  cans per minute with the two lines merging together before the filler the paxton solution included two x  hp xt blowers each complete with nano filtration for the outlet air an  nozzle air manifold with internal ionizing bar and failsafe controls the installed paxton system not only dramatically reduced the company’s water usage but also maintained the high standards of product quality as demonstrated by thorough qc testing prev next testimonials the paxton ionizing air rinser has been in operation in the buena park plant for  months there have been no quality or mechanical issues during this time and we are very satisfied with the performance on several occasions we have had a few follow up questions and our paxton rep patrick donovan has come to the plant to answer all questions and verify the operation of the unit and did some extra training so far pepsi buena park is very happy with paxton randy williams maintenance manager i can’t believe how well the paxton system operates we should have gotten this system a long time ago every month we remained with the old equipment it’s like we were throwing money down the drain in wasted energy costs bakery plant manager this machine works wonders charlie lyver project managermaintenance manager with the kind of energy savings we experienced the powerdry unit paid for itself in less than a year we’re working with paxton now on replacing compressed air drying in other areas of the plant canning facility maintenance manager it does what it is supposed to do it is nice to see a product work as advertised pat cell general manager the paxton blowers not only outperform those previous installed but they are also much quieter and paxton service was excellent throughout the entire process dan lardinois corporate engineer a lot of times when you get more technology in a plant you have to pay for it with more work keeping the system running but the powerdry doesn’t create any extra hassles like that
