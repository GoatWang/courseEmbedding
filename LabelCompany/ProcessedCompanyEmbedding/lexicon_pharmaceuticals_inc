approach we are working to discover and develop innovative medicines to safely and effectively treat disease and improve patient lives precision science the genome fuels our discovery through our genome™ program lexicon scientists spent more than a decade studying the role and function of nearly  genes to pinpoint the key targets for drug development this systematic targeted approach led us to identify more than  protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases these precise targets serve as our roadmap for the development of pioneering medicines that have the potential to improve the standard of care for patients so that they can live better more empowered lives pioneering medicines improving the standard of care our passion is to bring medicines to the market that have the potential to improve the standard of care for diseases that have not experienced new treatment innovation in years – decades in some cases we are not driven by any particular disease area or patient population rather using our roadmap of precise targets we intentionally seek out relatively unexplored mechanisms our approach may not be the easiest path but we believe that in the longterm it will ultimately provide the greatest benefit to patients patient driven improving patient lives we believe in treating people not just diseases our focus is patient driven and we

lexicon’s position on offering compassionate use to investigational medicines how the fda views access fda position on access to investigational drugs outside of a clinical trial expanded access read more…       lexicon pharmaceuticals inc is focused on developing breakthrough treatments for human disease to do this lexicon conducts clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of investigational medicines which if proven safe and effective will allow lexicon to seek the necessary approvals from regulatory authorities to provide patients with access to these medicines in general lexicon believes that participating in clinical trials is the best way for patients to access investigational medicines prior to approval in some extreme circumstances when this is not possible patients with lifethreatening diseases or conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting these situations are typically referred to as compassionate use but also are known as expanded access early access preapproval access and emergency use the clinical development process the process by which a drug is developed and tested for safety and efficacy and if proven safe and effective is submitted to regulatory authorities for approval for use involves controlled testing in humans to ensure both safety and efficacy because it is not known during clinical development whether an investigational medicine is safe or effective compassionate use may present risks for both the patient and the clinical development program for patients compassionate use may bring potential safety risks or a false sense that the medicine will provide benefit for the clinical development program it can delay or jeopardize the approval of a new medicine being sought by many conducting clinical trials is extremely complex and challenging the ultimate goal is the rigorous testing of the clinical product with the aim of securing regulatory approval and enabling the medicine to be available to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible lexicon has ethical responsibilities to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trials and to minimize risks to current research participants and future patients these ethical responsibilities require that strict criteria are applied for the compassionate use of its investigational medicines lexicon considers many factors when considering a request for compassionate use of an investigational medicine such as the strength of the clinical data the known benefits and risks to the patient the impact on the clinical development program the phase of development and the probability timing of regulatory approval at lexicon a compassionate use program or a single request for compassionate use of an investigational medicine will only be considered if all of the following conditions are met the disease or condition being studied is serious or lifethreatening there are no adequate alternative therapies or clinical trials available sufficient preliminary efficacy and safety data exist about the investigational medicine in order for lexicon to make a benefitrisk analysis consistent with the establishment of a compassionate use program this would not occur earlier than the time that results from phase b studies are known and depending on the clinical program potentially even later sufficient clinical data are available to identify an appropriate dosage the patient’s treating physician and lexicon’s chief medical officer or equivalent position both have evidence to believe there is the potential for the specific patient under consideration to reasonably expect benefit from the treatment and there is ample evidence to support the possibility that the benefit will outweigh the potential risk of treatment an adequate supply of the investigational medicine exists to support both the ongoing clinical trials and approved compassionate use until and if the product becomes commercially available the patient is not eligible for a lexiconsponsored clinical trial of the investigational medicine geographic limitations to participation in a trial would generally not fulfill this criterion granting access to the investigational medicine must not interfere with the completion of clinical trials that could support regulatory approval of the medicine or otherwise compromise the potential development of the investigational medicine the request must be made by the patient’s treating physician unsolicited by lexicon or any other individual or organization the patient is a resident of a country in which lexicon retains development and commercialization rights to the investigational medicine lexicon cannot make a guarantee that a compassionate use program will be available and even if a compassionate use program is offered lexicon cannot guarantee that the investigational medicine will be available to a particular patient if all these conditions are met lexicon will consider compassionate use requests from treating physicians subject to applicable laws and regulations all requests will be evaluated in a fair unbiased manner patients with any underlying medical conditions that may pose safety risks or those that have not been sufficiently characterizedstudied would not be granted compassionate use any preapproval access to investigational product must always comply with all applicable laws and regulations and approvals must be secured as required from applicable regulatory bodies and institutional review boards or ethics committees if approved the patient or his or her guardian must provide informed consent and consent to comply with the safety and monitoring requirements defined by lexicon the treating physician must also agree to comply with all applicable safety and monitoring requirements compassionate use will cease being made available once the investigational medicine becomes commercially available or if as demonstrated by clinical trials the investigational medicine does not demonstrate a positive benefitrisk to patients patients who believe they have a medical need and meet lexicon’s criteria for compassionate use should speak to their treating physicians who can make a request via the following this email address is being protected from spambots you need javascript enabled to view it lexicon expects that it will acknowledge receipt of any such requests within  business days when clinical trial records containing information about expanded access to lexicon’s investigational products become publicly available pursuant to section jaiiiigg of the public health service act lexicon will add a hyperlink or other appropriate reference to those records on this website page as authorized by the st century cures act lexicon may revise this position statement at any time  additionally the posting of this position statement by lexicon shall not serve as a

financial results for the three months ended march   and provided an overview of key milestones for the company’s newlylaunched commercial product xermelo™ and its pipeline drug candidates “the first quarter was a transformative one for lexicon marked by the approval and launch of xermelo in the us i am extremely proud of the extraordinary men and women at lexicon who ensured that xermelo was available to patients within days following approval” said lonnel coats lexicon’s president and chief executive officer “eight weeks into the launch we continue to make significant strides in providing access to xermelo and communicating its benefits to patients we are very pleased with the speed and depth of xermelo adoption which we believe is a reflection of the early positive feedback we have received from both patients and physicians in addition we continue to advance our robust pipeline of drug candidates and look forward to reporting on multiple milestones including new data from our three phase  sotagliflozin trials starting this month” first quarter  product and pipeline progress xermelo telotristat ethyl  mg • on february  th  the us food and drug administration fda approved xermelo as the first and only oral therapy for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog ssa therapy in adults inadequately controlled by ssa therapy • prescriptions for xermelo were available to patients that same day and the drug was available for shipment within  hours of launch • the company initiated its lexcares™ program within hours of launch to ensure access and appropriately remove adherence hurdles for patients in need of this innovative therapy sotagliflozin • in may the company expects to report additional efficacy data from the us phase  intandem study data will include secondary endpoints such as body weight and blood pressure in hypertensive type  diabetes mellitus tdm patients • in q  lexicon anticipates additional data release from the eu and israel phase  intandem study in patients with tdm data will include secondary endpoints such as body weight and blood pressure in hypertensive tdm patients as well as pooled continuous glucose monitoring cgm results from intandem and intandem • lexicon previously announced that primary endpoints were met in both the intandem and intandem studies demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in ac at  weeks on a background of optimized insulin • the company anticipates topline data release in mid from the global phase  intandem study evaluating approximately  tdm patients treated with sotagliflozin mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy but without insulin optimization prior to randomization the primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients with ac less than  and no severe hypoglycemia and no diabetic ketoacidosis dka events • lexicon’s partner sanofi continues to enroll type  diabetes mellitus tdm patients in several phase  clinical trials lx • phase  clinical trials for lx remain ongoing and the company anticipates the release of data this year from these studies in healthy subjects and patients with tdm lx • the company expects to file an ind for lx in neuropathic pain in mid followed by initiation of a phase  clinical trial this year first quarter  financial highlights revenues lexicon’s revenues for the three months ended march   increased to  million from  million for the corresponding period in  primarily due to revenues recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with sanofi revenues for the three months ended march   included  million of net revenues recognized in march  from the sale of xermelo in the us cost of sales lexicon had cost of sales related to sales of xermelo of  million for the three months ended march   including finitelived intangible asset amortization lexicon began capitalizing inventory during the three months ended march   following fda approval of xermelo as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product manufacturing costs for xermelo incurred prior to fda approval were recorded as research and development expenses the precommercialization inventory of xermelo is expected to be sold over approximately the next two years as a result cost of sales for xermelo for the next two years will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials than would otherwise be expected during the three months ended march   intangible assets relating to xermelo of  million were reclassified from indefinitelived to finitelived assets once the fda approved xermelo and the company began amortizing this asset using the straightline method over its estimated useful life cost of

pharmaceuticals inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease the company was founded in  in the woodlands texas under the name lexicon genetics incorporated by cofounders arthur t sands ray b webb and the company has used its patented mouse gene knockout technology and extensive in vivo screening capabilities to study nearly  genes in its genome program and has identified over  potential therapeutic targets lexicon has advanced multiple drug candidates into human clinical trials and has a broad and diverse pipeline of drug targets behind its clinical programs lexicon is pursuing drug targets in five therapeutic areas including oncology gastroenterology immunology metabolism and ophthalmology the companys clinical drug candidates include sotagliflozin lx for the treatment of type  diabetes lx for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders telotristat ethyl lx for the treatment of the symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome and lx for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis contents  company history  technology  locations  references company historyedit a lexicon genetics knockout mouse left that is a model of obesity compared with a normal mouse lexicon pharmaceuticals was founded in september  as a biotech venture of baylor college of medicine the company went public in april  with one of the largest initial public offerings in biotech history  million in june  lexicon purchased a privately owned small chemical library synthesis company coelacanth corporation in princeton new jersey which became the site for the companys small molecule and medicinal chemistry efforts the companys original name was lexicon genetics incorporated but in  the name changed to lexicon pharmaceuticals inc to reflect a renewed focus on drug development the company initially focused on using gene knockout technology to define the function of genes this effort complemented and benefited from the international effort to sequence the human and mouse genomes see human genome project using its proprietary gene trapping and gene targeting technologies the company created the world’s largest repository of genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cells known as omnibank and established a largescale mammalian knockout program to discover the physiological and behavioral functions of the most druggable mammalian genes the information collected from this program is stored in the company’s lexvision database which contains almost  gene knockouts studied over the years lexicon evolved from a genomics company into a drug discovery and development company focused on discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease the company currently has multiple drug candidates in various stages of clinical trials technologyedit lexicon uses patented gene trapping and gene targeting technologies to generate and study knockout mice to discover the physiological and behavioral effects that result from the disruption of a single gene knockout because there is a close similarity in gene function and physiology between mice and humans with a large majority of human genes having a counterpart in the mouse genome knockout mouse technology has become a powerful tool in the discovery of new medicines the value of lexicon’s technology in drug discovery has been described in a retrospective analysis by the scientific journal nature the conclusion of this analysis was that in most cases there was a direct correlation when comparing the physiological characteristics or phenotypes of knockout mice to the therapeutic effect of the  bestselling drugs of  the tremendous utility of knockout mouse technology was recognized in  with the nobel prize in physiology or medicine to drs mario capecchi martin evans and oliver smithies in developing small molecule drugs for its validated targets lexicon uses sophisticated medicinal chemistry known as click chemistry dr k barry sharpless who was awarded the  nobel prize in chemistry pioneered this set of powerful and reliable tools for the rapid synthesis of novel compounds lexicon uses solutionphase chemistry to generate diverse libraries of optically pure compounds that are built using highly robust and scalable organic reactions that allow the company to generate compound collections of great diversity and to specially tailor the compound collections to address various therapeutic target families lexicon’s medicinal chemists design these libraries by analyzing the chemical structures of drugs that have been proven safe and effective against human disease and using that knowledge in the design of scaffolds and chemical building blocks for the generation of large numbers of new druglike compounds locationsedit lexicon operates from two locations found in texas and new jersey the corporate headquarters are in the woodlands texas just north of houston this location serves as lexicon’s primary research facility to discover and validate the companys drug targets and test drug candidates in preclinical research the company’s clinical development and regulatory team is also based at the corporate headquarters lexicons campus in princeton new jersey is the home of lexicons small molecule medicinal chemistry and preclinical

cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn

personalized medicine the promise of personalized medicine share tweet link email print phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the
