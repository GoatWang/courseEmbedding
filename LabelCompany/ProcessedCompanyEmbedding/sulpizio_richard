sulpizio to help construct a stateoftheart cardiovascular patient care and clinical research facility in recognition our facility is called the sulpizio cardiovascular center when it opened in  the center unified ambulatory clinical and inpatient heart and stroke care in one convenient location it has also won recognition for its worldclass design including being named one of the nations most beautiful hospitals in  and modern healthcares highest design honor maria gaby and richard sulpizio richard sulpizio chairman of the center’s board of directors and president and ceo of qualcomm enterprise services has personal experience with cardiovascular disease both his father and brother died of heart conditions but that’s not the only reason behind the couple’s generous gift sulpizio says he was inspired by the vision of dr anthony demaria uc san diego professor of medicine and the director of the cardiovascular center “at our first meeting he made a compelling case for the work he and his staff are doing and the fact that they needed a worldclass facility” sulpizio recalled recently “he explained it’s not just about technology it’s about the people who use the technology he talked about sharing everything under one roof being able to attract topnotch doctors “my wife and i decided that if we could help to give a worldclass facility to continue both the training and the clinical work with patients that is done at uc san diego medical center it would be an honor” as part of an academic medical system the new facility will unite leaders in cardiovascular medicine cardiothoracic surgery pulmonary vascular medicine vascular surgery stroke heart imaging and research through this collaborative approach research discoveries can move quickly to the bedside so patients benefit sooner from new methods of prevention diagnosis and treatment “we’re lucky to have ucsd here in the community having an academic medical center is pretty impressive” sulpizio said “and it’s not only the academic medicine aspect and the care they deliver it’s the three d’s the medical center discovers delivers and disseminates if you go to a regular hospital they don’t offer all those aspects “at ucsd we know we are dealing with people that other facilities don’t have we’re pleased to help support such outstanding physicians and researchers many of whom are among the best in the nation” gaby sulpizio whose mother has heart disease is an enthusiastic supporter of the project as well “our family knows personally how devastating cardiovascular diseases can be which is why we have been so active with ucsd’s cardiovascular center for a number of years” gaby said “also ucsd’s program focuses on cardiovascular issues for women the numberone cause of death among females “we are confident that the health and future of many generations to come will benefit from the health care work at ucsd content area two​appointmentsnew patients  current patients  more about appointments
