for joining massroots’ second quarter earnings call my name is isaac dietrich and i currently serve as massroots’ chief executive officer before we begin we’d like to state that this call does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities or assets of massroots inc this presentation includes certain statements estimates and projections provided by massroots with respect to anticipated future performance such statements estimates and projections constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws these forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks which may cause actual results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forwardlooking statements the recipient of this information is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements no representations or warranties are made as to the accuracy of such forward looking statements or whether any of the projections included herein will be realized massroots does not expect to update or otherwise revise this presentation i’ve prepared some brief remarks covering massroots’ revenue growth business model user growth and product development but the majority of this call will be spent answering questions from you our shareholders questions may be submitted via email to irmassrootscom now on to the call i’m pleased to report massroots generated  in revenue during the second quarter of  more than all previous quarters in our corporate history combined this took our cumulative yeartodate revenue to  of which approximately  was generated from our core product of digital advertising as a digital product massroots is able to scale rapidly with minimal additional cost – the only marginal expense associated with gaining additional users is an increase in server activity for massroots’ main revenue generators digital advertising and a dispensary locator the only marginal cost is the credit card processing fee we believe that as its model continues to mature we will be able to generate significant revenue with negligible cost of goods sold we believe that massroots can reach cashflow positive from its current user base and web traffic the problem over the past year hasn’t been users– massroots sees more eyeballs than many other cannabis websites and apps – the problem has been our products have lacked the core functionality to connect users with the dispensaries and products for which they are looking we believe that our dispensary finder is a solid first step in fixing this deficiency with the core functionality now in place we aim to rapidly iterate and expand on its functionality to include menus with live pricing product pages with reviews and top search result placement for paid advertisers we believe that each of these features will create new revenue streams for our business – weedmaps reportedly generated over  million in revenue in  off of such features revamped massroots for business portal we originally introduced massroots for business in early  as an online portal for businesses to schedule posts and view analytics while useful for businesses it did not have the features or capacity to scale to millions of dollars in revenue when fully developed the revamped massroots for business portal will consolidate many online marketing functions for cannabisrelated business in one central platform we expect businesses will be able to schedule posts on massroots facebook and twitter purchase advertising on both massroots ownedproperties as well as third party digital properties and view actionable realtime data from massroots and third party sources in easytoread formats we believe this will serve as a solid foundation for future businessrelated features as we prepare to integrate dispensary pointofsale data later this year as of june   we had total currently assets of  and total current liabilities of  million – which is not a great balance sheet subsequent to the close of the quarter we have closed  million in a registered offering at share with  warrants which puts us within striking distance of being able to fully repay our debts and rebuild our assets expense reductions during the six months ending june   we incurred general and administrative expenses of  that is a lot of money now  of that was for common stock issued for services and  was for options issued for services which slightly dilutes the company’s shares but doesn’t take cash of the business so let’s look at the remaining  – there’s about  in onetime investment banking fees there’s  in cost of goods sold primarily for the onetime event the  rally there’s about  in advertising that we can significantly reduce because we’ve built a great brand that can grow organically so there’s about  in other expenses or about  per month during july  the company eliminated  in monthly expenses by terminating relationships with certain vendors reducing headcount from  to  fulltime employees and utilizing new technological tools to achieve better results with fewer resources as many of these contracts and agreements had   or day termination clauses we expect these expense reductions not to be fully reflected until the fourth quarter of  reductions in staff were concentrated on the content account services and sales teams while the team focused on our core product – development – remains fully intact even as massroots continues to scale its user base and revenues we do not expect a significant increase in the size of our team as we plan to automate as many processes as possible in a selfservice platform for our clients like other leaders in the technology field our plan is to scale through automation and technology not by increasing our staff and overhead we believe these expense reductions could result in significant savings for the company currently estimated to be approximately  annually massroots’ management will continue to review for unnecessary expenses on a weekly basis and believe the company can reach cashflow positive on a monthly basis by the end of  the team massroots has  fulltime employees working out of headquarters in downtown denver colorado the majority of these employees are engineers and designers focused on developing new features for the massroots platform we believe that over the long run a small talented and close knit team of a will outperform larger teams of b and c we believe we have found talented individuals at every level – sales representatives who outperform expectations managers who make architectural decisions that will prevent costly and timeconsuming blunders and engineers developing new features that have the potential to provide significant long term returns one of massroots’ top priorities in  has been recruiting and retaining some of the top talent in the cannabis and technology industries in june  we hired lance galey as massroots’ chief technology officer previously mr galey served as chief software architect of cloud services for autodesk and vice president and principle architect at salesforce where he led the architecture and development of numerous core infrastructure and platform services underlying a large portfolio of salesforce saas applications in  he was selected as the executive mvp for the technology division of salesforcecom state and national brand business model while massroots’ consumerfacing network launched in july  we did not start generating advertising revenue until we crossed a half million users in midaugust  our clients have primarily been ancillary businesses marketing their products to cannabis consumers through endorsed posts on massroots sponsored content on our blog and mentions in our email newsletter it is not necessary for a user to join massroots in order for us to generate revenue from them – we are finding that many people will visit our website join our email newsletter or view a dispensary’s profile without registering for our massroots network during the second quarter of  we signed advertising contracts with a total value of  with  of the leading cannabis brands in the industry as many of these contracts were for   or month campaigns only a portion of the value was realized during the second quarter of  and the rest will be realized over the coming quarters building a solid foundation on which we can expand while the vast majority of massroots’ advertising revenue to date has come from brands within the cannabis industry we have started to see significant interest from mainstream brands and advertising agencies looking to market to cannabis consumers uber and fusion a division of univision became the first mainstream brands to advertise with massroots and have opened the doors for other major brands to evaluate the space we believe that as the regulated cannabis market continues to expand mainstream brands and advertising agencies will begin to allocate portions of multimillion advertising budgets towards outreach to the millions of cannabis consumers in the united states – especially food lighter and agricultural brands we are positioning massroots to be one of the first companies to receive these budget allocations local store business model up until the beta launch of our dispensary finder in august  we didn’t really have a product for local dispensaries or stores limiting our market we now have over  dispensary locations paying for a basic listing with the core functionality now in place we aim to rapidly iterate and expand on its functionality to include menus with live pricing product pages with reviews and top search result placement for paid advertisers we believe that each of these features will create new revenue streams for our business – with weedmaps reportedly generating over  million in revenue last year off of them  elections massroots believes the  elections have the potential to significantly increase the size and scope of the regulated cannabis industry according to the marijuana policy project campaigns in maine nevada arizona california michigan florida and massachusetts are expected to succeed in placing initiatives on their states’ ballots for this year’s election historicallyspeaking the demographic makeup of the electorate during presidential election years tends to be younger and more diverse than in offyear elections groups that are generally more supportive of the legalization of cannabis we believe a number of the state initiatives on this year’s ballot stand a significant chance of becoming law a  arcview market research report projects the regulated cannabis industry could grow to  billion by  as a result of this year’s elections our business model is designed to benefit from this trend when a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law we are able to start registering users and businesses in that state with minimal marginal cost because massroots is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis we do not have to build outgrow operations open retail stores or have a significant physical presence in the state in order to generate revenue at the same time massroots’ financial model is not tied to the success of a particular location or brand – we believe we will have a significant percentage of all dispensaries and brands on our platform making massroots a play on the industry as a whole sitting at the intersection of healthcare on the medical cannabis side and a vice industry on the recreational cannabis side we believe the cannabis industry can continue to grow in any economic climate   recent press denver post  massroots hires former salesforce vp as cto forbes  nasdaq denies massroots stock listing application fortune  the

fox capital longshort equity growth at reasonable price research analyst deep valuestone fox capitalsummarymassroots is building up a technology platform for the growing state approvals for marijuana usethe stock remains depressed by the nasdaq unwilling to approve an uplistingfederal regulations remain a big catalyst for the industrythe company already has a vibrant app with over one million users for a social play in the cannabis sectorlegal use of cannabis is spreading like a wildfire the country may even be close to federal rules that dont prohibit the use of marijuana for recreational use with several cannabisrelated stocks public massroots otcqbmsrt provides a unique opportunity to play the explosive growth in legal use of pot possibly even better the stock recently bounced down to the lows where the stock has traded since issues with uplisting to the nasdaq has kept the stock below  massroots now has multiple catalysts for the business and the stock cannabis market status on july  nevada became the th state to allow people to buy marijuana for recreational use the state joins colorado oregon washington and alaska on this list massroots provides this convenient chart showing all of the states that have approved some form of legal marijuana use source massroots presentation one of the biggest issues holding back the development of cannabisrelated businesses and the uplisting of massroots to the nasdaq is the uncertainty regarding legal issues at the federal level state laws currently conflict with federal regulation that prohibits the use of marijuana specifically the nasdaq blocked the uplisting of the stock back in may  deeming the company as aiding and abetting the distribution of an illegal substance under federal law a couple of bills propose eliminating the federal classification of marijuana as a controlled substance hr  and hr  republican congressman tom garrett seeks with hr  to remove marijuana from the federal schedule of controlled substances the bill was introduced on february  so plenty of questions exist on whether this bill will get passed conversely any move by the trump administration including attorney general jeff sessions that is against legalization to further tighten federal regulations could have devastating impacts to cannabisrelated businesses and harm the stocks according to data from arcview market research via forbes north american marijuana sales grew  to  billion in  the research firm forecasts sales growing at an annual compounded rate of  to reach  billion by  all of the trends support that federal prohibition of marijuana use will eventually get removed but no guarantees exist social play transforming massroots is an interesting stock because the company is a technology play with a cto that has experience at salesforce crm and microsoft msft along with other employees that have worked at some of the largest tech giants until the recent odava acquisition the company was primarily focused on the social aspect of cannabis but the recent deal makes massroots more of a technology and compliance platform the company has had an app on the app store for years with the app getting banned back in november  and reinstated in february  due to consumer demand despite limited states with approved legal use the app has crossed over  registered users from mostly california colorado and oregon the app allows user reviews on products and dispensaries in the industry similar to how yelp yelp works for restaurants and other local businesses consumers can rate products and strains based on their efficacy and other metrics as well as dispensaries in a similar manner to yelp revenue from the app is based on advertising the odava platform offers software for the cannabis businesses from pointofsale systems to inventory data to possibly crucial compliance data in an industry sure to require plenty of regulations massroots hopes the integration of the odava platform will allow for a connection with the app for consumers to check local inventories with consumer reviews the odava platform will provide a recurring revenue stream from dispensaries that will subscribe to the software package the growth potential is enormous with each state that legalizes marijuana sales in addition the company is still in the process of expanding outside of their original focus market of oregon that will grow the target market from  dispensaries to potentially  by  source massroots presentation finances need work massroots is clearly still in the startup phase the combination of a target market only now opening up and questionable federal regulations leaves the future far brighter than the reality of past quarterly results q revenues were in the thousands and not the millions revenues did grow  yoy but the base from last q was below  the addition of odava will boost revenue going forward along with the general growth in the industry the company ended the quarter with  million in cash on the balance sheet after burning  million from operations in the quarter the  million loss initially appears alarming but the vast majority of the loss was due to the  million charge for stockbased compensation massroots got over  million in funding from the exercising of warrants and states the need to raise additional funds in the next year amounting to at least  million the company expects to raise a large amount of that from more exercised warrants but massroots will likely need to raise additional funds from selling equity typical of a venturetype company in the early stages of growth after issuing  million shares to odava shareholders and granting  million shares to the founders that vest over two years the company will have over  million shares outstanding the current valuation approaches  million and naturally topped  million when the uplisting to the nasdaq was in the process as with any small company that isnt profitable massroots faces the risks of not being able to raise capital at reasonable terms as well federal regulations remain a big hurdle for the industry where conflicts with state laws could prevent participation in typical capital markets as well the company needs to further gain mass scale with the social app to achieve the audience that attracts advertisers achieving these goals will come at a cost not to mention a larger technology company could swoop in with access to significantly more capital to steal market share massroots will want to ensure their product is top notch and potentially can expand beyond just cannabis takeaway the key investor takeaway is that massroots is positioned to benefit from the regulatory trend to approve medical and recreational use of marijuana the growing markets approving marijuana use will boost the business while potential federal legislation could provide another large boost to the stock the risks that the market doesnt materialize as expected is further heightened by the lack of profits and a precariously low cash balance for the company for those that think the positive trend in regulations governing marijuana use will only expand massroots offers an ideal technology play that can easily expand as additional states are added to the approved list as always these small stocks are only recommended for diversified portfolios where the investor is willing to
