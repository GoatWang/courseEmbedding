critical electrical elements of poet platform subprocess steps for transistors see more in the third party valuation of its poet technology pdf ready at the right time cmos silicon evolution is ending • moore’s law era  • cpugpu execution unit speeds haven’t improved in over  years • industry looking for new technology path • packaging techniques have not improved oe transceiver cost • various hybrid integration techniques like  d packaging silicon photonics have not led to improved optoelectronic transceiver costs • singlechip transceivers needed for fiber to fully replace copper for system interconnect applications • copper cable era for system interconnect is ending •  gigabit ethernet system interconnect was and is mostly copperbased •  gigabit ethernet system interconnect was and is almost entirely fiberbased • optical systems need more lithography less mechanical assembly • many optical systems that need aligned arrays of sensors andor lasers cannot be built today due to mechanical assembly cost constraints • poet offers this alignment capability by means of lithography dramatically lowering the cost of these products ir sensors holographic displays etc applications • poet’s technology can surpass speed limits of widely used cmos silicon chips and is much better positioned for stacking multiple chips to increase performance • a functional poet device may reduce the power consumption of laptops tablets smartphones servers andor other electronic devices by  • leads to drastic reduction in device size and battery power consumption • power reduction in commercialscale server farms represents tremendous cost savings to companies like ibm google and intel • in november  hewlett packard announced that it is working with numerous chip manufacturers to

presentation q   extensive dd collection below httpwwwpoettechnologiescomwpcontentuploadspoettechnologiescorporateoverviewseptemberpdf short to mid term goals q october  december  the business development white paper will be made available under nondisclosure agreement “nda” to potential prospective partners and ip licensees only this was announced in the pr of june rd so this could be done already or in progress nda   milestones to be announced soon see picture below dates are approximations  not etched in stone  milestone   terminal switching laser demonstration poet lab  milestone  optical thyristorbased infrared detector array fabrication and validation rd party fab  milestone  could have a contractlicense attached with the announcement of this milestone or thereafter days weeks a month from the pr june rd once online wafer production begins after the repair of the mbe molecular beam epitaxy which was damaged by hurricane sandy producing wafers for the continuance of the bae systems military ir sensor proof of concept project due for completion later this year will take precedence the poet platform is currently the basis for a number of key projects including optical code division multiple access ocdma devices for avionics systems combined rfoptical phased arrays optoelectronic directional couplers and ultralowpower random access memory ram  as you can see above there are other key projects that form the basis for a contractlicense which can be announced any day now  just in case there are delays in the short term projections they will then be done in the mid term goals section  contractlicense andor establishing one or more pdas board of directors have endorsed the next phases of the company’s commercialization plan put forward by the special strategic committee ssc chaired by executive director peter copetti the multipronged approach is based on discussions with potential industry partners and advisers  regarding the company’s two key markets consisting of the military and commercial sector that have been identified as potential early adopters of the poet platform currently while poet’s incorporation in  military projects is proceeding well and should provide value in several key verticals significant value exists in adapting poet for mass production within a commercial semiconductor fab environment the company must rapidly move to the next phase of its commercialization plan which includes addressing feature size and scalability requirements for commercial fabs the board has therefore endorsed and authorized the ssc to proceed on these recommendations including  establishing a poet development alliance pda – the company will be establishing relationships with one or more industrial partners looking towards jointly adapting poet to commercial scale iiiv implementation alliance partners will provide key input including intellectual assets technical staff manufacturing capability and foundry resources in addition to optimizing device parameters and yields a nearterm goal will be to establish comprehensive design rules and a device parameter library for poet which will proliferate licensed designs in a poet device ecosystem  drive for reduction of feature size to nm range nm – the company will reprioritize its technical roadmap by introducing specific milestones associated with reducing feature size from the submicronto the nm range in scale targeting q for that milestone consequently the milestone for full optoelectronic integration on a single die will be rescheduled to q even without this full integration milestone the nm goal anticipates the cadence of commercial iiiv foundry capabilities this roadmap will focus the company’s odis subsidiary on developmental work that will allow for scalable production within existing commercial fabs  adoption of a shareholder rights plan srp – the company will be structuring a special srp to protect the potential value of the company for all shareholders during the period where discussions with potential partners may be taking place regarding pdarelated agreements and as progress on the nm project continues “this move crystallizes the company’s strategy for unlocking the value of our intellectual property” said mr copetti “a development alliance with the right partners will definitely shorten timetomarket and help evolve a design ecosystem for poet in the marketplace” further ssc actions will be endorsed by the board depending on the status of the above initiatives mr copetti added “while the new featuresize milestone is a challenge given our commitment to projects in our delivery pipeline i believe the poet team is more than capable of achieving this goal there is no doubt that poet can demonstrate its n and pchannel capability to be a viable and scalable complement to silicon cmos” the company’s proprietary poet platform has demonstrated monolithic fabrication of integrated circuit gallium arsenide gaas based devices containing both electronic and optical elements on a single wafer by offering components with the potential for increased speed density reliability and lower costs poet offers the semiconductor industry the ability to push moore’s law to the next cadence level overcoming current siliconbased bottlenecks and potentially changing the roadmap for a broad range of applications  completion of milestone  demonstration of nm or below pet n and p channel device and ring oscillator rd party labline it is important to note that this time rd party labline has been used instead of rd party fab this clearly indicated that by that time q that at least one pda has been established because a third party lab will have to do this validation and the line part indicates that this can be done in massproduction  contracts licenses  pdas can be announced on any given day keep in mind that the stock will be halted under canadian law which also affects the adr poetf when a contract has  amounts attached to it the stock will open again on an adjusted basis so for swing traders it can be dangerous if you sold your position just the day prior to a contract announcement just saying mid to long term goals q  q of   q  ms integrated external modulator for continious wave laser demonstration poet lab  q  ms full integration of electronical and optical devices on single die rd party fab  again contracts licenses  pdas can be announced on any given day and as we near the completion of the revolutionary poet platform it can also be that a hostile buyout is offered although this total buyout can also come prior to the completion of poet one just has to take a very promising pharmaceutical company with several products in development as example that is bought out prior to completion of its pipeline products this can happen to poet technologies inc as well see monetization options below monetization paths several options to monetize poet • poet is a research company not a product company • poetpet are ready to enter the commercialization process • no single company is currently active in all market areas where poet provides a bestinclass value proposition syndicate needed to extract full value from technology platform single acquirer • this path would involve selling poet to a single by definition large rd party • technology accessinvestment would likely be syndicated by acquirer • relatively small number of viable candidates multiple acquirers • this path would involve selling poet to a syndicate likely structured as a joint venture • ideal syndicate would include members with market presence in all key areas related to poet commercialization licensing • certain specialized market segments might be best addressed by licensing all or part of the poetpet technology to one or more rd parties for use in a given market • can be complex with difficulttoforesee implications for other activities  the company is seeking to monetize the revolutionary poet platform as described above in case its sold for  billion this would equate to share with fully diluted shares of  million in part  of the poet presentation they expect to see   billion please read
