to agricultural funds evidenced by hundreds of millions of dollars being raised and the oversubscribed status fof recently closed funds in some cases capital has been turned away paine  partners capital fund iv lp reached final financial close with usd 89m in commitments private equity firm paine  partners made the announcement on jan  but fund iv formally reached final close at yearend following first financial close in july  equilibrium capital’s acm permanent crops llc fund reached final financial close with usd m in commitments acm went through a series of financial closes in  public filings indicate and reached final close at yearend global aginvesting has learned paine  partners capital fund iv had an early target size of usd 8m while acm permanent crops had a hard cap at usd m global aginvesting has learned both funds were oversubscribed investors are comprised of public pensions endowments and family offices paine  partners also received a maiden allocation from an investor in the middle east region institutional interest maine public employees retirement system mainpers committed to both funds including usd m allocated to paine  partners capital fund iv in december  the pension similarly authorized a usd m investment in the acm permanent crops fund but the commitment was slashed to usd m due to the fund being oversubscribed according to andrew sawyer mainepers chief investment officer the acm allocation will be made from public market equity “we will in all likelihood make other investments to get towards our target of  in natural resources” said sawyer in addition washington state investment board committed usd m to acm permanent crops global aginvesting has learned kevin schwartz president and a founding partner of paine  partners attributes the robust interest in a space he says has been underserved by private equity to macro dynamics “a growing global population with more affluence has increased the demand for efficient and sustainable protein sources” schwartz told global aginvesting “at the same time there is a constrained supply creating a significant opportunity for investment”   fund strategy   while both paine  partners capital fund iv and acm permanent crops invest in agriculture the funds take different tacks   paine  partners which says fund iv is the largest dedicated food and agribusiness private equity fund invests along the food and agribusiness value chain including upstream and downstream assets fund iv specializes in a swath of opportunities across ipgenetics seed fertilizer water feed animal health products crop production aquaculture wild primary processing valueadded processing contract manufacturing food ingredients and functional foods   “part of what differentiates paine  partners is its ability to partner with management teams to unlock growth and enable companies to fulfill their potential” said schwartz noting the firm’s blend of investment and operating professionals with successful careers in the agriculture industry   “these professionals work extensively with the management teams of the companies we invest in and utilize their expertise to drive growth and create value paine  partners…is involved in every step of this process” he added   meanwhile acm permanent crops which is currently active in the market targets permanent cropland in the produce segment — such as table grapes blueberries and citrus — as well as related midstream assets across california oregon and washington for instance  rob hurlbut principal at equilibrium capital and head of the firm’s sustainable agriculture strategies pegs the fund’s irr at  –  permanent crops offer a twopronged return scenario comprised of capital appreciation plus income generated from yearly crop sales

fiduciaries ncreif on jan  revealed that the ncreif farmland index generated returns of  in  falling short of the  returns generated in the prior year permanent cropland however far outpaced annual cropland led by performance in almonds and pistachios in the fourth quarter permanent cropland — whose returns favored income over capital appreciation — delivered total returns of  versus  for annual cropland as for strategy acm has taken an owneroperator approach the firm will rely on its own talent and expertise to manage all of its own assets which it expects will drive sustainable alpha over the year life of the fund “we believe that management is critical to success in the category and have built our team with that in mind” said hurlbut in the market according to public filings financial
