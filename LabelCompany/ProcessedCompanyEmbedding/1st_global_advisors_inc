this section of the disclosure brochure  brochure  will summarize the specific material changes that have been made since the previous version of the brochure was published the types of changes discussed in this summary will relate to the nature of the material changes we made to our policies practices or conflicts of interest this will help you decide whether to review all or only certain portions of the brochure or to contact us with questions about the changes that were made the previous version of this brochure dated september   has been amended as follows the following language regarding alternatives investments has been added to the sections discussing our brokerage practices other fees and expenses and special product considerations non publicly traded reits and lps may be sold for a commission by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative the commission may be roughly seven percent of the purchase price and reduces the number of shares owned these same products are often also made available by investment adviser representatives at net asset value  nav  and included as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account this increases the number of shares owned but you may pay more than one percent on the value of the asset for  or more years these products have no liquidity therefore cannot be managed and are designed to be held for ten or more years additionally valuation methodologies for certain lps are subject to substantial limitations and lack of uniformity and while valuation methodologies for non publicly traded reits have become more uniform with the recent introduction of more detailed regulatory rules in our view those valuations are still not commercially practicable for use in a fiduciary environment as an appropriate billable value for these reasons we have chosen to exclude them as billable assets on our advisory platforms these products may only be offered via commission through our affiliated broker dealer by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative in the event one of these products undergoes a liquidating event sooner than anticipated you may end of paying more for the product by paying a commission conversely if the product is owned for the anticipated holding period you will likely pay more if it is sold to you at nav and held as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account in order to obtain these products via nav you will have to purchase them elsewhere we will provide you with a summary of any material changes to our brochure by october  of each

will communicate necessary changes to you and reposition assets as needed your ims flex choice account may either be a cash or margin account a margin account is one in which the firm carrying the account lends cash to you with which you purchase securities unlike a cash account a margin account allows you to buy securities by borrowing the money in the financial services industry investors often open margin accounts to take advantage of an opportunity to leverage their investment not because they lack the money to make the full purchase however investors using the ims flex choice platform most often use margin in conjunction with check writing capabilities offered on these accounts margin allows you to borrow money in cases where a check is written for an amount greater than the cash balance while this borrowing has a cost it also prevents you from prematurely selling securities and allows you to make a later deposit to return the money borrowed while the use of margin may offer the potential to leverage an investment and allows you greater flexibility in the operation of your account buying securities on margin also subjects you to additional costs and risks that should be carefully considered your ims flex choice account may be a discretionary account for which the iar need not seek your approval prior to purchasing or repositioning assets the use of discretion requires specific written approval from us in addition you must provide written authorization to allow your iar to utilize discretion in the account as a matter of course no common stock position should be greater than  of the total portfolio value we may waive this policy if circumstances deem it to be appropriate ims unified choice program the ims unified choice program is a wrap fee program and differs from the other ims programs in that you pay a single fee for trade execution and portfolio management services wrap fee programs differ from other programs in that the fee structure for wrap programs is all inclusive whereas non wrap programs include trade execution costs that are in addition to the advisory fees for example our ims select portfolio program is not considered a wrap fee program because you pay transaction costs that are in addition to the asset management fee and are generally borne by you in the case of wrap fee programs such accounts are managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy used by the respective third party portfolio manager on the other hand our ims flex choice program is managed by your iar in accordance with his or her own investment methodology and philosophy in some cases you may decide to forgo a thirdparty portfolio manager to manage the fixed income portion of your wrap fee account and instead choose to have our fixed income department create a bond ladder you might also choose a third party portfolio manager to manage a portion of your fixed income allocation and have our fixed income department manage a portion of your fixed income allocation in these instances the bond ladders created by our fixed income department will be managed in accordance with the investment methodology and philosophy of our fixed income department for the investment advisory services provided to you by us and your iar we and your iar receive a portion of the investment advisory fee you pay when you participate in the program for more information relating to our wrap fee program please refer to the st global advisors inc wrap fee program brochure  the ims unified choice program

hedge funds private equity and structured investments are billable assets this means that we charge you quarterly advisory fees based on the value of your hedge fund private equity and structured investment assets beyond the infrastructure of the ims programs your investment advisory fee is for the specialized advice and guidance provided by your iar regarding these assets we make hedge funds and private equity investments available only to qualified purchasers qualified clients or accredited investors as those terms are defined under applicable securities laws we make hedge funds and private equity available only to those clients with moderate growth or aggressive growth profiles specifically your scored profile must be moderate or above in order to be able to purchase hedge funds andor private equity in an account a client scoring moderate but choosing conservative may purchase hedge funds andor private equity in limited circumstances you are permitted to choose conservative and still purchase a hedge fund andor private equity only when it is required for account grouping purposes and not because you feel a need to accept less risk than the moderate scoring would indicate we permit this only for instances where you have a group of accounts that are managed together at a risk score of moderate or above and the account in which the hedge fund andor private equity will be purchased requires a conservative allocation to support the necessary allocation to fixed income across all accounts for example you may choose to be more heavily weighted in fixed income securities in one account an account with a conservative allocation and more heavily weighted in equity securities in another account an account with a more aggressive allocation when taken in total your grouped portfolio must be a moderate growth or aggressive growth allocation to choose these investments we have the discretion to waive these guidelines for unforeseen circumstances that do not violate our fiduciary obligation structured investments are available only to those clients with a conservative moderate growth or aggressive growth risk profile we limit your investment in hedge funds or private equity to no more than  of your stated net worth furthermore and generally no more than  of your portfolio may be allocated to hedge funds private equity structured investments nonpublicly traded reits and limited partnerships lps combined no more than  of your portfolio may be allocated to a private equity hedge fund or any single buffered return enhanced note bren offering a type of structured investment the rest of the account will be allocated to the appropriate portfolio type as determined by your profile the percentage allocated to each asset class within the portfolio type will be proportionately reduced by the percentage of the portfolio allocated to hedge funds private equity andor structured products we make special rebalancing considerations for those accounts incorporating an allocation to hedge funds private equity or structured products we caution that you may have limited opportunities to redeem shares of hedge funds or private equity because the underlying securities may not be available for sale for long periods of time and the hedge funds and private equity impose restrictions on repurchase offers further limiting exit strategies or redemptions structured investments are available in various maturities as outlined in the offering document for the product due to these restrictions the portion of your account allocated to the asset allocation model will be rebalanced independent of any hedge funds private equity andor structured investments in the account the asset allocation model alone will be rebalanced back to the original target allocations of that model it is not feasible for us to incorporate hedge funds private equity andor structured investments into the rebalance process once a structured investment matures or a hedge fund or private equity is redeemed you and the iar can determine how to reinvest or withdraw the proceeds and you may fully rebalance your account at that time hedge fund and private equity  minimum investment amounts vary as described in the fund s offering document the minimum account balance required to include an allocation to a structured investment is  the minimum investment in a structured investment is  an account found to be in violation of the above concentration limits may be forced to remove illiquid alternatives from the account concentration issues may be addressed in a number of ways including the transfer of products to a separate brokerage account or the de networking of a product to be held directly at the product sponsor for qualified clients we offer access to other illiquid investments for qualified clients we offer access to other illiquid investment alternatives such as non publicly traded reits and limited partnership interests unlike hedge funds private equity and structured investments these are non billable assets and are typically only placed in the account for convenience avoids multiple accounts and reporting purposes we rebalance your asset allocation independent of these products as well the illiquid alternative portion of the account which includes hedge funds private equity structured investments non publicly traded reits and lps generally may not exceed  of the account we may waive these requirements under circumstances we deem to be appropriate non publicly traded reits and lps may be sold for a commission by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative the commission may be roughly seven percent of the purchase price and reduces the number of shares owned these same products are often also made available by investment adviser representatives at net asset value  nav  and included as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account this increases the number of shares owned but you may pay more than one percent on the value of the asset for  or more years these products have no liquidity therefore cannot be managed and are designed to be held for ten or more years additionally valuation methodologies for certain lps are subject to substantial limitations and lack of uniformity and while valuation methodologies for non publicly traded reits have become more uniform with the recent introduction of more detailed regulatory rules in our view those valuations are still not commercially practicable for use in a fiduciary environment as an appropriate billable value for these reasons we have chosen to exclude them as billable assets on our advisory platforms these products may only be offered via commission through our affiliated broker dealer by individuals acting in their capacity as a registered representative in the event one of these products undergoes a liquidating event sooner than anticipated you may end of paying more for the product by paying a commission conversely if the product is owned for the anticipated holding period you will likely pay more if it is sold to you at nav and held as a billable asset in a fee based advisory account in order to
