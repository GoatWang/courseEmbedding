nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafldnonalcoholic steatohepatosis nash nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld refers to a spectrum of hepatic lipid disorders characterized by hepatic steatosis with no known secondary cause  it is subcategorized into a nonalcoholic fatty liver nafl defined as the presence of of steatosis in the absence of histological evidence of hepatocellular injury and b nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash hepatic steatosis accompanied by hepatocyte injury and inflammation nash may occur with or without fibrosis but may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis nafld is generally associated with energy metabolism pathologies including obesity dyslipidemia diabetes and metabolic syndrome the prevalence of nafld is high prevalence in the general population is estimated at  with prevalence of nash estimated to be   patients with obesity or diabetes demonstrate  prevalence of nafld and those with dyslipidemias are estimated to have a prevalence of  these therapeutic combinations are presently in clinical development obesity the global prevalence of obesity has doubled over the past three decades the obesity epidemic now represents a significant public health risk in the us and other developed countries as well as in the developing world in the us  of the adult population and  of the pediatric and adolescent populations are obese and  of the population is overweight or obese obesity results in a  year reduction in lifespan and there are more than  obesityrelated deaths annually in the us further obesity increases the risk of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease type  diabetes hypertension dyslipidemia obstructive sleep apnea and some cancers however weight loss of just  reduces the risk and severity of these comorbidities nusirt has demonstrated that combining lleucine with established therapeutic agents results in a shift in energy disposition from storage in adipose tissue to oxidation in skeletal muscle and significant decreases in body weight and fat waist circumference and obesity comorbidities and is now developing these combinations as therapeutic modalities type  diabetes and prediabetes in  the american diabetes association and the european association for the study of diabetes jointly published a position statement on management of hyperglycemia in this publication metformin is listed as the first line drug of choice for newly diagnosed people with diabetes who cannot control their glucose with diet and exercise alone reports suggest that metformin is the most frequently prescribed medicine for diabetes while metformin is considered a relatively safe medicine use of metformin alone to treat tdm has several drawbacks including gi side effects that reduce compliance andor lead to drug discontinuation it is estimated that between  of patients who take metformin experience nausea vomiting andor diarrhea and these adverse events are dose related in addition metformin does not address other health risk factors common to diabetes most notably the elevated inflammatory stress that contributes to cardiovascular risk in diabetics therefore there remains a significant unmet therapeutic need to address drug efficacy diabetesrelated cardiovascular risk and side effects nusirt has demonstrated that lleucine converges on the same signaling pathway ampksirt activated by metformin to increase insulin sensitivity accordingly the company developed a product concept employing a proprietary combination of lleucine with significantly lower doses of metformin to achieve glucose control equivalent to the customarily used higher metformin doses based on results from discovery and preclinical studies nusirt has developed a combination product intended for human use  this product consists of a fixed dose combination of leucine and metformin with a goal to augment metformin efficacy and produce equivalent glucose control to customarily used higher does of metformin in patients with type  diabetes a phase a clinical trial of this concept has been completed with results presented at the ada th annual scientific sessions june   other development areas nusirt has clinical data

research dr cherrington’s work over the years has defined the effects of various hormonal and neuronal factors on liver glucose metabolism specifically he has characterized the effects of insulin glucagon cortisol epinephrine and norepinephrine on the rates of hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in vivo more recently he has examined the roles these agents play in regulating glucose production during a variety of stressful situations exercise hypoglycemic illness or injury he has also studied the response of the liver to glucose ingestion and has shown that postprandial glycogen deposition is dependent not only on the availability of glucose and insulin but equally on an additional “portal” signal the nature of the signal and the mechanism by which it works are currently under study dr cherrington has significantly advanced our understanding of the way in which hormones and neural mediators regulate the ability of the liver to supply glucose in times of need and to store it in times of plenty he is recognized worldwide as an authority in this area having published  peerreview papers and  review articles over the past  years dr cherrington is also considered an
