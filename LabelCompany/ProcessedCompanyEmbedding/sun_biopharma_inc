preclinical study resultspreclinical studies have shown that sbp produces superior antitumor activity in human cancer cell lines compared to gemcitabine or nabpaclitaxel alone or in combination standard of care chemotherapy drugs used to treat pancreatic cancersun biopharma’s novel approachthe company believes that sbp will have a distinct advantage over current pancreatic cancer therapies in that it specifically targets the exocrine pancreas and can cause ablation or pharmaceutical resection of the acinar cells as well as the primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer while leaving the insulinproducing islet cells and most nonpancreatic tissue unharmed  most current cancer therapies including chemotherapy radiation or surgery are associated with significant side effects that further

pancreatic cancer – sun biopharma pancreatic cancer pancreatic cancer pancreatitis scientific publications intellectual property adenocarcinoma of the pancreas affects approximately  people worldwide annually including nearly  in the united states  in western europe  in australia and  in japan it is the th leading cause of death from cancer in the us and the th leading cause of cancer death in europe pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pda represents approximately  of all pancreatic cancers with a year survival rate of approximately  considering that the median overall survival for previously untreated patients with good performance status is between  months and  months with the best available treatment regimens effective treatment for pda remains a major unmet medical needthe diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is usually delayed because the initial clinical signs and symptoms are vague and nonspecific by the time the diagnosis is made the cancer often is locally advanced or metastatic usually to regional lymph nodes liver lung and peritoneum and is seldom amenable to surgical resection with curative intent the most common presenting symptoms include weight loss epigastric andor back pain and jaundice the back pain is typically dull constant and of visceral origin radiating to the back in contrast to the epigastric pain which is vague and intermittent less common symptoms include nausea vomiting diarrhea anorexia and glucose intolerancecurrently surgical resection offers the only potentially curative therapy but since most patients have disease that is unresectable at the time of diagnosis cure is unlikely the prognosis for these patients is poor and most die from complications related to progression the mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease is chemotherapy current chemotherapy treatment regimens vary from single agent gemcitabine and various gemcitabine combinations to the multidrug folfirinox leucovorin folinic acid fluorouracil irinotecan and oxaliplatin regimen which is frequently supplemented with white blood cell wbc growth factors these treatments deliver to selected patients with good performance status median survival benefits ranging from  weeks to  months versus controls of gemcitabine alone  clearly more effective treatments for unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are needed sbp is being proposed as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma snbp stock price  sun biopharma inc stock quote us otc  marketwatch sections watchlist signup • login search
