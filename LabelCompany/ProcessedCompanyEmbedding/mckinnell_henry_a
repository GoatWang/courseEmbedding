jr became chief executive officer of pfizer in january  and chairman of the board in april  after holding a series of senior executive positions spanning more than  years with the company during his time at pfizer mckinnell helped turn the company from a leader in the pharmaceutical industry into a transforming force with the acquisitions of warnerlambert in  and pharmacia in  and the subsequent successful integration of both firms forming a behemoth that earned  billion in  observers described mckinnell as polished stately and avuncular yet also exacting passionate and sometimes impatient a deeply moral man mckinnell expanded pfizers philanthropic activities both in the united states and in the developing world personal background mckinnell was a thirdgeneration canadian brought up in vancouver british columbia he went to a christian brothers school through the eighth grade an experience that imbued him with a strong moral code his father owned and operated cargo vessels during his teen years and through college he spent school vacations working on his fathers ships as a deckhand and first mate he gained a penchant for racing austin healey sports cars in events sponsored by the sports car club of america and spent two summers racing many west coast tracks from vancouver to los angeles he enrolled at the university of british columbia intending to major in chemical engineering and eventually become a college professor he described himself as an average student with a greater focus on extracurricular activities than academics during the first half of his fiveyear stint at the university he then married and decided to get serious switching his major to business administration and finishing second in his class based on his achievement mckinnell received a ayear fellowship to the stanford business school a tidy sum at that time—it was in fact more money than most fulltime jobs offered he accepted and earned a doctorate within three and a half years although he received several offers to join businessschool faculties as an assistant professor mckinnell instead elected to gain practical experience in the business world he accepted his first job at american standard turning down an offer from pfizer after working in brussels for two years he accepted a position with pfizer in tokyo for what he thought would be another twoyear period after which he would return to academia an early riser mckinnell woke up between four and five in the morning and put in  to hour days at the office he lived in manhattan and on the weekends went to a retreat home in greenwich connecticut where he enjoyed swimming fishing skiing and bikeriding an avid sportsman he ran a full marathon while living in japan and competed in four minitriathlons in greenwich early career at pfizer a global focus an upward path when mckinnell joined pfizer in  in tokyo he requested sales training a request that was initially puzzling to his new employer given his possession of a doctorate but mckinnell brushed past the perceived diminutive nature of sales positions knowing that understanding how sales worked would be essential to understanding a business as a whole his request was granted and he developed an appreciation for pharmaceutical sales medical marketing product development and product commercialization this knowledge coupled with early exposure to international business laid the foundation for a career at pfizer that spiraled inexorably upward until mckinnell was named chief executive officer in  after three years in tokyo pfizer gave mckinnell an opportunity that was rare for a yearold who still thought he would get back to teaching the chance to run pfizers operations in iran and afghanistan which comprised a fully selfcontained pharmaceutical business the opportunity allowed mckinnell to learn about all aspects of the business—sales marketing manufacturing operations and product development subsequently mckinnell was named president of pfizers asia division based in hong kong until  his first post in the united states came afterward in corporate strategic planning where he was instrumental in convincing pfizers board of directors to alter the companys capital structure in order to implement a share repurchase program this move was significant in that up to that time pfizer had been debtfree the new program would require that the company borrow in order to buy back its own shares mckinnell effectively argued that the companys longterm growth prospects would more than offset the interest that would accrue in paying back the loan his assessment proved right and successive chief financial officers continued the program mckinnell continued to move quickly up the corporate ranks he was named chief financial officer his first finance job and president of pfizers us pharmaceutical division in  by  he was again promoted as president of pfizers global pharmaceuticals group the companys principal operating division he was responsible for worldwide pharmaceutical operations he was executive vice president from  to  and then president and chief operating officer from may  to may  in january  he took over the reins as chief executive officer from william c steere jr with whom mckinnell had worked closely for over a decade by may  he added the position of chairman of the board steere had ended his decadelong tenure as ceo having achieved his goal of making pfizer the number one company in the world which had come with the  merger of pfizer and warnerlambert with the company having achieved the industry leadership position just as he entered the role of chief executive mckinnell wanted to articulate a new vision that would push pfizer to ever greater heights he faced some daunting challenges an industry under attack due to pricing issues patent expirations for several blockbuster drugs with sales of at least  billion and growing calls to expand the availability of prescription drugs to the needy and those without insurance mckinnell would have to apply his considerable executive political and leadership skills to address these issues at the helm of pfizer new vision greater achievements one of mckinnells first actions as ceo was to gather a group of the  most senior managers to define a new vision and mission for pfizer mckinnell posed a simple yet compelling question how do we move beyond number one with mckinnell leading the group decided that pfizers new vision would be to hold a position as the worlds most valued company to patients to customers to business partners to colleagues and to communities where we work and live becker march  in order to achieve this transformation the group defined six areas that needed change most of which had been addressed by early  focus on core business human pharmaceuticals as ceo mckinnell continued to implement a key strategy he had been espousing since arriving at pfizers new york headquarters to focus pfizer on human pharmaceuticals by selling off noncore businesses indeed in early  human pharmaceuticals was the largest business segment making up  percent of pfizer revenues at that time pfizer announced plans to review some  noncore consumer products for possible sale in  and  pfizer divested itself of several of these noncore business units implementing the vision through strategic mergers and acquisitions what set pfizer apart from the hundreds of other large corporations who had attempted largescale mergers in the hopes of achieving operational efficiencies and increased competitiveness was that under mckinnells leadership the company successfully completed not one but two mergers of big pharmaceutical companies in  pfizer acquired warnerlambert which had been marketing lipitor one of the worlds most prescribed drugs of those used for lowering levels of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl or bad cholesterol the acquisition saved the combined company some  billion the new market share exceeded the two companies previous market shares combined increasing from  percent to  percent in april  pfizer completed the acquisition of pharmacia corporation another major drug manufacturer for  billion market share increased to  percent among world pharmaceuticals pfizer now had  drugs generating annual sales of  billion each and one drug with sales of over  billion by  pfizer marketed eight of the worlds  bestselling medicines and  products considered leaders in their therapeutic categories the company had over  employees worldwide and a pipeline of over two hundred projects in research and development mckinnell sought to fill out the rd pipeline with strategic acquisitions of biotechnology companies in december  pfizer announced the acquisition of esperion therapeutics the biopharmaceutical company that developed therapies targeting highdensity lipoprotein hdl to treat cardiovascular disease other acquisitions were expected in  delivering the numbers pfizers financial performance mckinnell consistently delivered numbers that kept wall street analysts humming in  pfizer earned revenues of  billion and a net income of  billion up  percent and  percent over  respectively these numbers reflected the acquisition of warnerlambert in  pfizer earned revenues of  billion and a net income of  billion up  percent and  percent over  respectively pfizer posted  revenues of  billion up  percent over —but a net income of only  billion down  percent from  these numbers were reported under gaap generally accepted accounting practices and reflected the charges incurred as a result of the acquisition of pharmacia in financial reports pfizer reconciled these gaap numbers to numbers that took into account purchaseaccounting rules which required inclusion of noncash charges in the adjusted numbers net income became  billion up  percent over  corporate citizenship pfizer had always had a long tradition of good corporate citizenship under mckinnells leadership the tradition expanded in  pfizer donated  million each working day through various channels rather than as an obligation mckinnell viewed corporate philanthropy more synergistically noting that when we help patients in need we enhance our standing with physicians win respect in local communities and create better working relationships with regulatory authorities when we keep our people out of hospitals and enable them to function as productive members of society we bolster economies and become the allies of governments flynn september  this philosophy positioned pfizer favorably but mckinnell forthrightly acknowledged that pfizers approach was as good for profits and shareholders as for patients and communities in march  mckinnell was appointed by president george w bush to the presidential advisory council on hivaids which was established to formulate recommendations on how best to ensure the highest quality research prevention and treatment for the disease mckinnell traveled to african nations that had been hit particularly hard by hivaids meeting with government leaders nongovernment organizations ngos and healthcare providers in order to formulate a strategy to combat the disease launched in december  the diflucan partnership program was initiated with the government of south africa in a publicprivate venture at no charge healthcare workers distributed pfizers diflucan a drug that fought two opportunistic fungal infections that together struck over half of african patients with fullblown aids pfizer later expanded the program to  other african countries at the end of  the program had distributed almost three million doses worth over  million and trained approximately  healthcare professionals in the latest aidscare practices pfizer was the first us pharmaceutical company and the largest us company overall to sign the united nations global compact created by the un secretary general kofi anan to distribute the benefits of globalization across all nations back home mckinnell took a proactive step to control medicaid costs in florida he contacted governor jeb bush and suggested that as prescription drug costs accounted for only  percent or  million of the states overall medicaid bill some of the money could be used for patient education and counseling that would in turn create better health awareness pfizer carefully monitored the results of the program hoping that mckinnells unorthodox approach would create favorable outcomes and be duplicated in other states on another thorny domestic healthcare issue mckinnell expanded the availability of prescription drugs to lowincome seniors on medicare the pfizer for living share card provided needed medications for a flat  fee to qualified seniors after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington dc on september   pfizer donated medicines healthcare products and supply services to those in need pfizer and the pfizer foundation pledged  million to the relief effort and the company also matched approximately  in employee contributions yet another humanitarian effort was referred to as hanks peace corps within pfizer approximately  to  medically and technically trained people spent six months to a year working in developing countries helping healthcare providers faithbased workers and members of ngos improve countries healthcare delivery services blending east and west an aggressive consensusseeking management style two factors characterized mckinnells management style consensus seeking and crossfunctional teamwork—both practices originating from his early exposure to japanesestyle management techniques associates at pfizer described mckinnell as an aggressive consensus seeker at a time when many american corporations were run under a militarystyle commandandcontrol structure mckinnell was a leader who encouraged open discussion of issues but knew how to bring closure to them deftly finding that zone of agreement where all minds involved could back a final decision mckinnell effectively imported consensusseeking to pfizer while most american companies struggled to improve internal operations by breaking down the barriers to communication inherent in silolike functionally oriented organizations pfizer instead adopted a japanesestyle crossfunctional team structure teams were composed of members of different functional areas who met together regularly over long periods—sometimes years—to see a product through all the processes of development regulatory approval and consumer marketing the wouldbe scholar and college professor was able to cultivate a culture of agreement and collaboration at a time when corporate chieftains typically operated with a hierarchical mindset and expected subordinates to follow the chains of command that they had successfully climbed that hank mckinnell was able to develop this leadership style while climbing to the same top job as his contemporaries suggests that what worked for him also worked for pfizer industry analysts gave positive assessments to mckinnells performance at pfizer through  as he continued to promise doubledigit returns the company remained a wall street favorite referring to the two successful megamergers one industry observer noted that pfizer was in a league of its own becker march  another analyst noted that pfizer was at the peak of its game media observers covering pfizer attempted to present mckinnell evenhandedly lee clifford of fortune magazine described mckinnell as polished tall stately and stiff with a barely perceptible canadian accent october   john simons also of fortune  characterized him thus warm and avuncular one minute exacting and impatient the next mckinnell is an odd cross between mr rogers and the cranky dr bones mccoy from star trek in a single conversation he can deliver a stirring monologue about curing the worlds ills then launch into a stern rant against consumer activists who think drug companies charge too much for their wares boersig october  robert l joss the dean of the stanford graduate school of business was proud of one of his most successful alumni when we see in one of our alumni a person of integrity an effective manager at the highest levels and a business leader who understands that business is a social institution which must keep the public trust we—as a school of management—want to recognize those achievements hank mckinnell has demonstrated in every way that he is a leader—as the head of the largest pharmaceutical company in the world as the overseer of the firms tremendous research efforts aimed at improving the human condition and as a corporate citizen lee february   the first among equals mckinnells reputation in the industry and community the clearest indication of mckinnells reputation among his peers was his election in  as chairman emeritus of the industrys leading trade organization the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma a group composed of the ceos of leading researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in his first address mckinnell laid out a blueprint for a reformed healthcare system in

boston massachusetts united states established in  as kallmann mckinnell  knowles by gerhard kallmann  michael mckinnell –present and edward knowles contents  history  boston city hall  designs  references  publications  external links historyedit the firm originated when it won an international competition to design the boston city hall in  soon reconstituted as kallmann mckinnell and wood kallmann the eldest member of the team is german born and english educated  mckinnell is english born and educated  both have served as  educators at the harvard graduate school of design henry a wood joined the firm in  the firm would go on to design structures across the united states and abroad while the firms early period consisted of bold structures of poured and precast concrete its later innovative work more often utilized brick stone copper slate and cast stone among other materials for buildings that were less brutalist in style and more postmodernist in particular the american academy of arts and sciences in cambridge massachusetts established kmws new direction with a copperroofed villa set amidst a stand of woods the course of the firms work through the late s was charted in alex kriegers exhibition at harvards graduate school of design and published in the catalog that he edited the architecture of kallmann mckinnell  wood in  david dillons tome of the same title carried the offices work through the early st century kmw buildings have won the harleston parker medal given out for the best new building in greater boston more times than any other firm in the history of the medal as documented in the major exhibit of kmws original drawings for boston city hall from  drawn from the kmw archive in the collection of historic new england this exhibition was presented at the wentworth institute of technology in boston and organized by architect gary wolf boston city halledit boston city hall and city hall plaza built  photo  the firms design for boston city hall was selected after a twostage national design competition with  entrants the jury composed of major architects and three prominent boston businessmen unanimously chose the project because of its logical and successful handling of the competitions complex building program because of its inventive response to the urban site and because of its powerful symbolism of a new boston boston historian walter muir whitehill proclaimed the kmk design to be as fine a building for its time and place as boston has ever produced horizon magazine lauded both the design and the competition process itself bostons juryhas turned in a decisive verdict that will stand for some time as a model of responsible civic conduct with its concrete massing echoing in an abstract fashion not only the classical cornices of ancient greece but also the neoclassical forms of federal boston and with its brick base creating a continuity with the nearby masonry structures of the blackstone block the building engaged the historic city in ways that the other competition entries did notcitation needed shortly after the buildings opening new york times architecture critic ada louise huxtable wrote boston can celebrate with the knowledge that it has produced a superior public building in an age that values cheapness over quality as a form of public virtue it also has one of the handsomest buildings around and thus far one of the least understood it is a product of this moment and these times the result is a tough and complex building for a tough and complex age a structure of dignity humanism and power public opinion has been mixed and remains so to this day in breaking with the smooth curtainwall surfaces and the simplified forms of the thenpopular postmiesian corporate modernism kallmann mckinnell and knowles design asserted the civic presence of city hall on the large surrounding plaza mckinnell spoke of how concrete allowed architects to return to early modernist principles of truthful expression of structure and materials while reacting critically to the corporate architectural establishment of the time after we won the city hall competition we were walking along madison avenue and we spied philip johnson coming towards us waving his arms in typical johnsonian fashion ah im so happy for you two young boys who have won this competition absolutely marvelous i think its wonderful and its so ugly we thought that was the greatest praise we could get city hall was published internationally both at the time of its design and upon its completion and popular publications and tourist guide books featured the building prominently just as the gateway arch in st louis and sydneys opera house—also products of widelypublicized design competitions—focused

address pfizer  east nd street new york new york  httpwwwpfizercom ■ dr henry a mckinnell jr became chief executive officer of pfizer in january  and chairman of the board in april  after holding a series of senior executive positions spanning more than  years with the company during his time at pfizer mckinnell helped turn the company from a leader in the pharmaceutical industry into a transforming force with the acquisitions of warnerlambert in  and pharmacia in  and the subsequent successful integration of both firms forming a behemoth that earned  billion in  observers described mckinnell as polished stately and avuncular yet also exacting passionate and sometimes impatient a deeply moral man mckinnell expanded pfizers philanthropic activities both in the united states and in the developing world personal background mckinnell was a thirdgeneration canadian brought up in vancouver british columbia he went to a christian brothers school through the eighth grade an experience that imbued him with a strong moral code his father owned and operated cargo vessels during his teen years and through college he spent school vacations working on his fathers ships as a deckhand and first mate he gained a penchant for racing austin healey sports cars in events sponsored by the sports car club of america and spent two summers racing many west coast tracks from vancouver to los angeles he enrolled at the university of british columbia intending to major in chemical engineering and eventually become a college professor he described himself as an average student with a greater focus on extracurricular activities than academics during the first half of his fiveyear stint at the university he then married and decided to get serious switching his major to business administration and finishing second in his class based on his achievement mckinnell received a ayear fellowship to the stanford business school a tidy sum at that time—it was in fact more money than most fulltime jobs offered he accepted and earned a doctorate within three and a half years although he received several offers to join businessschool faculties as an assistant professor mckinnell instead elected to gain practical experience in the business world he accepted his first job at american standard turning down an offer from pfizer after working in brussels for two years he accepted a position with pfizer in tokyo for what he thought would be another twoyear period after which he would return to academia an early riser mckinnell woke up between four and five in the morning and put in  to hour days at the office he lived in manhattan and on the weekends went to a retreat home in greenwich connecticut where he enjoyed swimming fishing skiing and bikeriding an avid sportsman he ran a full marathon while living in japan and competed in four minitriathlons in greenwich early career at pfizer a global focus an upward path when mckinnell joined pfizer in  in tokyo he requested sales training a request that was initially puzzling to his new employer given his possession of a doctorate but mckinnell brushed past the perceived diminutive nature of sales positions knowing that understanding how sales worked would be essential to understanding a business as a whole his request was granted and he developed an appreciation for pharmaceutical sales medical marketing product development and product commercialization this knowledge coupled with early exposure to international business laid the foundation for a career at pfizer that spiraled inexorably upward until mckinnell was named chief executive officer in  after three years in tokyo pfizer gave mckinnell an opportunity that was rare for a yearold who still thought he would get back to teaching the chance to run pfizers operations in iran and afghanistan which comprised a fully selfcontained pharmaceutical business the opportunity allowed mckinnell to learn about all aspects of the business—sales marketing manufacturing operations and product development subsequently mckinnell was named president of pfizers asia division based in hong kong until  his first post in the united states came afterward in corporate strategic planning where he was instrumental in convincing pfizers board of directors to alter the companys capital structure in order to implement a share repurchase program this move was significant in that up to that time pfizer had been debtfree the new program would require that the company borrow in order to buy back its own shares mckinnell effectively argued that the companys longterm growth prospects would more than offset the interest that would accrue in paying back the loan his assessment proved right and successive chief financial officers continued the program mckinnell continued to move quickly up the corporate ranks he was named chief financial officer his first finance job and president of pfizers us pharmaceutical division in  by  he was again promoted as president of pfizers global pharmaceuticals group the companys principal operating division he was responsible for worldwide pharmaceutical operations he was executive vice president from  to  and then president and chief operating officer from may  to may  in january  he took over the reins as chief executive officer from william c steere jr with whom mckinnell had worked closely for over a decade by may  he added the position of chairman of the board steere had ended his decadelong tenure as ceo having achieved his goal of making pfizer the number one company in the world which had come with the  merger of pfizer and warnerlambert with the company having achieved the industry leadership position just as he entered the role of chief executive mckinnell wanted to articulate a new vision that would push pfizer to ever greater heights he faced some daunting challenges an industry under attack due to pricing issues patent expirations for several blockbuster drugs with sales of at least  billion and growing calls to expand the availability of prescription drugs to the needy and those without insurance mckinnell would have to apply his considerable executive political and leadership skills to address these issues at the helm of pfizer new vision greater achievements one of mckinnells first actions as ceo was to gather a group of the  most senior managers to define a new vision and mission for pfizer mckinnell posed a simple yet compelling question how do we move beyond number one with mckinnell leading the group decided that pfizers new vision would be to hold a position as the worlds most valued company to patients to customers to business partners to colleagues and to communities where we work and live becker march  in order to achieve this transformation the group defined six areas that needed change most of which had been addressed by early  focus on core business human pharmaceuticals as ceo mckinnell continued to implement a key strategy he had been espousing since arriving at pfizers new york headquarters to focus pfizer on human pharmaceuticals by selling off noncore businesses indeed in early  human pharmaceuticals was the largest business segment making up  percent of pfizer revenues at that time pfizer announced plans to review some  noncore consumer products for possible sale in  and  pfizer divested itself of several of these noncore business units implementing the vision through strategic mergers and acquisitions what set pfizer apart from the hundreds of other large corporations who had attempted largescale mergers in the hopes of achieving operational efficiencies and increased competitiveness was that under mckinnells leadership the company successfully completed not one but two mergers of big pharmaceutical companies in  pfizer acquired warnerlambert which had been marketing lipitor one of the worlds most prescribed drugs of those used for lowering levels of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl or bad cholesterol the acquisition saved the combined company some  billion the new market share exceeded the two companies previous market shares combined increasing from  percent to  percent in april  pfizer completed the acquisition of pharmacia corporation another major drug manufacturer for  billion market share increased to  percent among world pharmaceuticals pfizer now had  drugs generating annual sales of  billion each and one drug with sales of over  billion by  pfizer marketed eight of the worlds  bestselling medicines and  products considered leaders in their therapeutic categories the company had over  employees worldwide and a pipeline of over two hundred projects in research and development mckinnell sought to fill out the rd pipeline with strategic acquisitions of biotechnology companies in december  pfizer announced the acquisition of esperion therapeutics the biopharmaceutical company that developed therapies targeting highdensity lipoprotein hdl to treat cardiovascular disease other acquisitions were expected in  delivering the numbers pfizers financial performance mckinnell consistently delivered numbers that kept wall street analysts humming in  pfizer earned revenues of  billion and a net income of  billion up  percent and  percent over  respectively these numbers reflected the acquisition of warnerlambert in  pfizer earned revenues of  billion and a net income of  billion up  percent and  percent over  respectively pfizer posted  revenues of  billion up  percent over —but a net income of only  billion down  percent from  these numbers were reported under gaap generally accepted accounting practices and reflected the charges incurred as a result of the acquisition of pharmacia in financial reports pfizer reconciled these gaap numbers to numbers that took into account purchaseaccounting rules which required inclusion of noncash charges in the adjusted numbers net income became  billion up  percent over  corporate citizenship pfizer had always had a long tradition of good corporate citizenship under mckinnells leadership the tradition expanded in  pfizer donated  million each working day through various channels rather than as an obligation mckinnell viewed corporate philanthropy more synergistically noting that when we help patients in need we enhance our standing with physicians win respect in local communities and create better working relationships with regulatory authorities when we keep our people out of hospitals and enable them to function as productive members of society we bolster economies and become the allies of governments flynn september  this philosophy positioned pfizer favorably but mckinnell forthrightly acknowledged that pfizers approach was as good for profits and shareholders as for patients and communities in march  mckinnell was appointed by president george w bush to the presidential advisory council on hivaids which was established to formulate recommendations on how best to ensure the highest quality research prevention and treatment for the disease mckinnell traveled to african nations that had been hit particularly hard by hivaids meeting with government leaders nongovernment organizations ngos and healthcare providers in order to formulate a strategy to combat the disease launched in december  the diflucan partnership program was initiated with the government of south africa in a publicprivate venture at no charge healthcare workers distributed pfizers diflucan a drug that fought two opportunistic fungal infections that together struck over half of african patients with fullblown aids pfizer later expanded the program to  other african countries at the end of  the program had distributed almost three million doses worth over  million and trained approximately  healthcare professionals in the latest aidscare practices pfizer was the first us pharmaceutical company and the largest us company overall to sign the united nations global compact created by the un secretary general kofi anan to distribute the benefits of globalization across all nations back home mckinnell took a proactive step to control medicaid costs in florida he contacted governor jeb bush and suggested that as prescription drug costs accounted for only  percent or  million of the states overall medicaid bill some of the money could be used for patient education and counseling that would in turn create better health awareness pfizer carefully monitored the results of the program hoping that mckinnells unorthodox approach would create favorable outcomes and be duplicated in other states on another thorny domestic healthcare issue mckinnell expanded the availability of prescription drugs to lowincome seniors on medicare the pfizer for living share card provided needed medications for a flat  fee to qualified seniors after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington dc on september   pfizer donated medicines healthcare products and supply services to those in need pfizer and the pfizer foundation pledged  million to the relief effort and the company also matched approximately  in employee contributions yet another humanitarian effort was referred to as hanks peace corps within pfizer approximately  to  medically and technically trained people spent six months to a year working in developing countries helping healthcare providers faithbased workers and members of ngos improve countries healthcare delivery services blending east and west an aggressive consensusseeking management style two factors characterized mckinnells management style consensus seeking and crossfunctional teamwork—both practices originating from his early exposure to japanesestyle management techniques associates at pfizer described mckinnell as an aggressive consensus seeker at a time when many american corporations were run under a militarystyle commandandcontrol structure mckinnell was a leader who encouraged open discussion of issues but knew how to bring closure to them deftly finding that zone of agreement where all minds involved could back a final decision mckinnell effectively imported consensusseeking to pfizer while most american companies struggled to improve internal operations by breaking down the barriers to communication inherent in silolike functionally oriented organizations pfizer instead adopted a japanesestyle crossfunctional team structure teams were composed of members of different functional areas who met together regularly over long periods—sometimes years—to see a product through all the processes of development regulatory approval and consumer marketing the wouldbe scholar and college professor was able to cultivate a culture of agreement and collaboration at a time when corporate chieftains typically operated with a hierarchical mindset and expected subordinates to follow the chains of command that they had successfully climbed that hank mckinnell was able to develop this leadership style while climbing to the same top job as his contemporaries suggests that what worked for him also worked for pfizer industry analysts gave positive assessments to mckinnells performance at pfizer through  as he continued to promise doubledigit returns the company remained a wall street favorite referring to the two successful megamergers one industry observer noted that pfizer was in a league of its own becker march  another analyst noted that pfizer was at the peak of its game media observers covering pfizer attempted to present mckinnell evenhandedly lee clifford of fortune magazine described mckinnell as polished tall stately and stiff with a barely perceptible canadian accent october   john simons also of fortune characterized him thus warm and avuncular one minute exacting and impatient the next mckinnell is an odd cross between mr rogers and the cranky dr bones mccoy from star trek in a single conversation he can deliver a stirring monologue about curing the worlds ills then launch into a stern rant against consumer activists who think drug companies charge too much for their wares boersig october  robert l joss the dean of the stanford graduate school of business was proud of one of his most successful alumni when we see in one of our alumni a person of integrity an effective manager at the highest levels and a business leader who understands that business is a social institution which must keep the public trust we—as a school of management—want to recognize those achievements hank mckinnell has demonstrated in every way that he is a leader—as the head of the largest pharmaceutical company in the world as the overseer of the firms tremendous research efforts aimed at improving the human condition and as a corporate citizen lee february   the first among equals mckinnells reputation in the industry and community the clearest indication of mckinnells reputation among his peers was his election in  as chairman emeritus of the industrys leading trade organization the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma a group composed of the ceos of leading researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in his first address mckinnell laid out a blueprint for a reformed healthcare system in the st century mckinnell was also chairman of phrmas business–higher education forum after ascending to the chief executives role mckinnell garnered a series of accolades in  institutional investor magazine named mckinnell the top ceo in the pharmaceutical industry he was also named chair of pfizers executive committee was a member of the pfizer leadership team and was a director of pfizer since june  he was a member of the influential
