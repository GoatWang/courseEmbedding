fierro one group’s growth an interview with celeste fierro senior vice president the one group editors’ note in  celeste fierro founded cititaste events and quickly became one of the most soughtafter event planners in new york city in  her career catapulted to the next level when she and jonathan segal opened one a restaurant in the heart of new york city’s meatpacking district the success of one led to the creation of stk and several additional equally as successful concepts that now span the globe company brief the one group wwwtogrpcom is a global hospitality company that develops and operates luxury restaurants lounges nightclubs and a turnkey food and beverage operation for boutique hotel groups founded in  the company currently operates a number of brands including stk asellina cucina asellina heraea and heliot and partners in nightclub tenjune and french bistro bagatelle the company operates venues in new york miami los angeles las vegas and atlanta in  the one group expanded internationally with the hippodrome casino and stk in the me hotel both in london what excited you about founding the one group has it been what you expected it has been better when i met jonathan segal founder and ceo i was running an event company a mutual friend introduced us and we became friends he thought the restaurant business was more about the djs and less focused on the food and he wanted to focus on all of it the food service design and music i thought it would be great to come in and undertake that with him utilizing my marketing and events background we hit it off i never thought we’d have as many venues as we have now so it has been pretty incredible stk london in the me hotel is it tough to communicate that the one group has a great food program when you’re known more for the music and design aesthetic people love the food even if they are initially enticed to come in for the party they always leave very impressed with our cuisine we stand apart because we have both the party atmosphere and high quality items on our menu all of our chefs are top of the line do you tailor the stk experience to the specific location or is there a similar feel in each one we tailor the dishes a bit of the music and the decor to the attitude of each city in los angeles the food is extra fresh because people pay more attention to their health there in miami the food has a latin theme atlanta is a southern market so we have a southern flair in new york the music is louder at our downtown location than it is in our midtown location is it challenging to manage the growth when you’re moving at such speed what are you planning for las vegas it’s a challenge but the more you open the easier it gets because you have an experienced team that comes in to manage the opening in las vegas we’ve opened a new concept we created called heraea it’s a sportsthemed restaurant and lounge it has similarities to stk but it is a sports and vibe driven venue the food is upscale not just wings and nachos you have also expanded in london are there more opportunities internationally we handle the food and beverage program for the hippodrome casino in london – that was the first property we did then we opened heliot which is a steakhouse inside the hippodrome we just opened stk in the me hotel as well as asellina which is our italian restaurant we are also handling the food and beverage for the me hotel which is right at the end of the strand in london we’re also looking to do stk in berlin in an industry with high turnover how have you retained your people our biggest strength is the fact that our staff is so loyal and a lot of them have worked their way up in the company we promote from within and that creates a loyal employee following because you’re giving them an opportunity to start and build a career we try to be as corporate as necessary but we also treat you as family we do a lot of things together as a company i know everyone’s name jonathan shakes everyone’s hand every night he walks into the restaurants we are handson and very visible i’m running seven cities and i’m in the restaurants all the time my staff knows who i am and i encourage input from them heraea in palms casino resort in las vegas below how important is it to continue to innovate in this business it’s all about marketing and staying in touch with customers which builds loyalty we have customers at stk who have continued to come regularly since the day we opened we know their names we’ll always seat our regulars and we make them feel special people want a consistently good product but also to know they’re going to be taken good care of i practice that in my management we also get involved in different charity and promotional events in the cities where we’re based we like to get the word out about our restaurants at senior levels this is a maleoriented business is that changing women are generally more detailoriented and can multitask which works well in this industry you have to love what you do and be competent at it and all of the women that work for me have those qualities you learn from your leaders and jonathan has empowered me to be a woman in this business i used to be intimidated but now i’m not i know the business and we have a good product we attract women because they want to work for a company that is empowering but also consistent and that gives them the opportunity for longevity and growth do you take time to reflect on the success or is it always on to the next because we’re opening so quickly it’s tough but you do step back and appreciate it it’s about being out there continuously maintaining relationships and giving the customer a great experience i believe that makes the difference• click here to download a
