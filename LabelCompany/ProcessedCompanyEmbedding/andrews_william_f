wfandrewsatoptusnetdotcomdotau dec   writing wrongs of wwii history righting a decadesold wrong has seen yearold bill andrews put pen to paper to write a book it is the story of australias merchant navy the long unheralded socalled fourth branch of the armed forces without whom the allied war effort would never have succeeded consisting of hundreds of civil ships and their crews enlisted into active service the merchant navy lost more men than any other service and andrews book is a tribute to the many mates who died in world war ii not one of their names is on the cenotaph in canberra and my book under the southern cross is to ensure their legacy lives on forever andrews said if it hadnt been for the merchant navy the war would never have been won they carried the troops and all their equipment and armament but classifield as civillans they were never considered part of the armed forces and untill last year had not been recognised they were on more  the ships laden with tanks and trucks and other heavy equipment and when they were fired upon would sink like a stone to the freezing bottom of the waters of the north atlantic no sailor could survive long in thoses conditions the greatgrandfather took six long years to pen a partfictional part historic action packed adventure about a seaman who sets off in serch of his missing brother the britishborn battler said he grew up believing the allied merchant navies and the allied navies were a brotherhood and should be held in the same regard andrews moved to melbourne where he spent years on the tugs at westernport bay in

have been won bill andrews author veteran of wwii mn less report as inappropriate by mike kemble nov   remember our merchant navy of ww crewed by men from all over the world many of whom died not even recorded because they were lascars or some other nationality the merchant navy was part and parcel of a floating fleet which along with the men and ships of our royal navy kept us free and fed throughout the longest battle in history the battle of the atlantic    the merchant navy was not recognised as such simply because they were civilians but these were civilians in the front line why were they not recognised for so long when a civilian sailor had his ship blown up beneath him and he was lucky enough to survive and be rescued he would land on shore to find that his pay had been stopped from the moment he lost his ship he would not get another penny until he signed on board another many of these surviving seamen would be rescued only to be torpedoed again and find themselves back in the water rescued again and blown up again and no pay criminal report as inappropriate refreshing  find reviews for previous versions there are no reviews for previous versions of this product
