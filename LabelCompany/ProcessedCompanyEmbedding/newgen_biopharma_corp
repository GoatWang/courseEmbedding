be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q forwardlooking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations strategies financial results or other developments forwardlooking statements are based upon estimates forecasts and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and many of which with respect to future business decisions are subject to change these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we disclaim any obligation to update forwardlooking statements   overview   we were incorporated under the name greenwind nrg inc in the state of nevada on february   our articles of incorporation initially authorized us to issue up to  shares of common stock par value  per share on september   we effected a for forward stock split of all our issued and outstanding common stock which increased the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from  to  on november   upon approval by our board of directors and majority stockholders we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the nevada secretary of state increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from  shares to  shares in connection with the amendment to our articles of incorporation our board of directors and majority stockholders also approved and adopted the amended and restated bylaws of the company on november   effective november   we changed the name of our company from greenwind nrg inc to newgen biopharma corp   we are a developmentstage company we have generated no revenues to date and have incurred losses since inception our limited operations to date have consisted of the formation of the company the raising of capital maintaining our public company reporting requirements our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months because we have not generated any revenues to date and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan   to date we have been unable to raise sufficient funds to fully implement our operations and we do not believe that we currently have sufficient resources to do so without additional funding as a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan our board of directors began to analyze strategic alternatives available to our company to continue as a going concern such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan   although our board of directors’ preference would be to obtain additional funding to implement our business plan the board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders such strategic alternatives include a merger acquisition share exchange asset purchase or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner we believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital any such business combination and the selection of a partner for such a business combination involves certain risks including analyzing and selecting a compatible business partner that is able to engage in a transaction with us and that has business operations which are or will likely prove to be profitable if we are unable to locate a suitable partner for a business combination and are otherwise unable to raise additional funding we will likely be forced to cease business operations   on october   we entered into a binding letter of intent the “loi” with newgen biopharma corporation a new jersey corporation “newgen new jersey” in connection with a proposed reverse acquisition transaction between the company and newgen new jersey whereby the company and newgen new

closing of the merger occurs the promissory note shall be cancelled as an intercompany loan in connection with the transaction        table of contents   in accordance with the terms of the loi on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with newgen new jersey and newgen merger sub inc a new jersey corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary “merger sub” pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement merger sub will merge with and into newgen new jersey with newgen new jersey being the surviving corporation and a whollyowned subsidiary of the company   as set forth in the merger agreement we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of newgen new jersey in exchange for the issuance to the current holders thereof of  shares of our

outstanding warrants and options   the merger is expected to be completed after the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement have either been satisfied or waived by the appropriate party or parties thereto the merger agreement contains certain closing conditions typically found in an agreement of such nature and the closing of the merger is conditioned upon the approval by the stockholders of newgen new jersey if we are able to close the merger transaction as contemplated by the merger agreement newgen new jersey will become our whollyowned subsidiary and we will report such event on a current report on form k to be filed with the sec   results of operations   comparison of three months ended january   and    we are still in our initial development stage and have generated no revenues to date   during the three month period ended january   the company incurred  in operating expenses compared to  in operating expenses during the three month period january   the

as the company had limited cash flows to repay outstanding obligations as they became due and an increase in the amounts owing to a related party for loans received to support the company’s daytoday activities and working capital purposes   financing arrangements   on march   a registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec registering a total of  shares of our common stock

liabilities   any future sale of additional equity and debt securities will result in dilution to current stockholders we may also seek additional loans where the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to expand business operations and could harm our overall business prospects   cash flows from operating activities   during the three month period ended january   the company used  in cash for operating activities compared to  in cash used for operating activities during the three month period ended january   the slight increase in the cash used for operating activities was attributed to the fact that the company had to pay more accounts payables

activities in connection with the merger agreement the company made advances in the amount of  to newgen new jersey from the sale of  units pursuant to the offering the proceeds of such sales were

for the investor to consider although these risks are not the only ones that the company faces if events anticipated by any of the following risks actually occur the company’s business operating results or financial condition could suffer and the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline   further the risks described below assume the consummation of a proposed reverse acquisition transaction between the company and newgen biopharma corporation a new jersey corporation “newgen nj” pursuant to which newgen nj will merge with a corporation whollyowned by the company in consideration for the issuance by the company of shares of common stock of the company to the stockholders of newgen nj the “merger transaction” newgen nj operates as a pharmaceutical company developing enhanced pharmaceuticals and cosmaceuticals intended to improve bioavailability safety efficacy dosage reductions and elimination of fedfast variability in drugs assuming the successful closing of the merger transaction newgen nj shall become a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and the business of the company shall consist primarily of the business of newgen nj   as used below “we” “us” and “our” refer collectively to newgen biopharma corp and newgen nj and references to the “company” refer to the company after giving effect to the merger transaction   risks relating to our business and financial condition   we lack operating history and have not generated any revenues or profits to date and we have incurred losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future   we cannot be assured that we can achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in the establishment of a business enterprise there can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable we may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us   our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing if we do not obtain such financing we may have to cease our activities and investors could lose their entire investment   there is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future we will require additional financing in order to proceed with the development and distribution of our products we will also require additional financing to pay the fees and expenses necessary to operate as a public company we will also need more funds if the costs of the development and operation of our existing technologies are greater than we have anticipated we will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us when it is required our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing if we do not obtain such financing our business could fail and investors could lose their entire investment   because we may never earn revenues from our operations our business may fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our company            we have no history of revenues from operations we have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably our company has a limited operating history if our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably then our stock may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our company   prior to obtaining customers and distribution for our products we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products in the future we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and we can provide no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our company   drug development is time consuming expensive and risky timing and results of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of products as well as the fda’s approval of products involve inherent uncertainty   we are focused on the development and implementation of nanotechnology platforms related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists medical personnel regulatory personnel statisticians and others which often delays limits or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products clinical trials can take many years to complete including the process of study design clinical site selection and the recruitment of patients as a result we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate and shorten the time that an approved product may be protected by patents if our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs if we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies we could suffer from significant cost overruns which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies   drug development is an inherently risky and uncertain process before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any new product candidates we and our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product likewise we and our partners may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate’s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later large scale trials a failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in the failure to obtain regulatory approvals   we cannot assure you that the federal drug enforcement agency fda or foreign regulatory agencies will approve clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or our partners on a timely basis if at all or if granted that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with the assessment by us or our clinical partners of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials any limitation on use imposed by the fda or delay in or failure to obtain fda approvals or clearances of products developed by us and our partners would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   before obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products we and our partners must conduct limited clinical or other trials to show comparability to the branded products a failure to obtain satisfactory results in these trials would prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals            our product candidates are in the early stages of development and because we have a limited operating and development history there is a limited amount of information upon which investors can evaluate our business and prospects   we have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our targeted business and prospects as our product candidates are still at an early stage of development we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields particularly in the biopharmaceutical area in order to execute our business plan we will need to successfully execute product development activities using our nanotechnology platform build maintain and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio demonstrate safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in clinical studies receive fda approval and gain market acceptance for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates develop and maintain successful strategic relationships with suppliers distributors and potentially licensing partners and manage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to preclinical and clinical trials if we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives we may not be able to develop our product candidates raise capital expand our business and continue our operations   we will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities   our business does not currently generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations we will likely need to raise additional capital to     · fund research and development activities including preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing   · fund our general corporate and administrative activities   · pursue business development activities and strategic partnerships for our technology platforms and drug candidates   · build up and protect our intellectual property portfolio and   · attract and retain senior management and scientists with relevant experience   we will need to raise additional funds through equity offerings debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the future to continue our operations and achieve our research and development objectives we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are commercially acceptable and favorable to us general market conditions may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities if adequate funds are not available we may have to further delay reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock   we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our product candidates to generate revenues and achieve profitability   the degree to which the medical community and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain the rate and degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products their potential advantage over alternative treatments and the costs to patients and thirdparty payers including insurance companies and medicare recent efforts in the united states and abroad to reduce overall healthcare spending has put significant pressure on the price of prescription drugs and certain companies have been publicly criticized for the relatively high cost of their therapies these pressures may force us to sell any approved pharmaceutical products at a lower price than we or analysts may anticipate or may result in lower levels of reimbursement and coverage from third parties   we cannot predict whether significant market acceptance of our products will ever develop and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market our revenue generation will depend substantially on our ability to introduce products that will be accepted by the medical community if we are unable to costeffectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical community or if the products associated with our technology do not achieve wide market acceptance our business will be materially and adversely affected             there is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate if we cannot develop and market our products as quickly or costeffectively as our competitors we may never be able to achieve profitable operations   we face substantial competition in the pharmaceutical industry competitive factors include product quality and price reputation service product safety development and efficacy technological innovation and access to scientific and technical information if we fail to compete successfully in any of these areas our business could be adversely affected and we may never be able to achieve profitable operations   many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and distributing approved products than we do competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours if our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable   we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreements for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to intellectual property in addition academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery research clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our platforms if we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions our business may suffer   issues with product quality and product defects could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and product liability claims and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products   our success depends upon the quality of our proposed products quality management plays an essential role in determining and satisfying requirements preventing defects improving our products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program a quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products   the development manufacture testing marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with the products we develop and market could result in product liability claims andor recalls of one or more of our products we cannot predict the frequency outcome or cost to defend any such claims product liability insurance coverage is expensive can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on commercially acceptable or satisfactory terms and may not cover all the potential future liabilities we may incur if we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to such potential claims although we have not experienced any material claims to date any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business            we are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations and our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our operations and products and those of our customers will be regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the united states the design development testing manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds are subject to regulation by governmental authorities including the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries the approval process is generally lengthy expensive and subject to unanticipated delays   any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to products may be subject to vigorous review and approvals are not certain applicants for fda approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product changes in fda approval policy during the development period or changes in regulatory review for each submitted nda also may cause delays or rejection of an approval even if the fda approves a product the approval may limit the uses or “indications” for which a product may be marketed or may require further studies the fda also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing   the regulatory path for approval of our products may be subject to review by several centers within the fda and there is no assurance that the fda will not change its requirements or review processes and standards human clinical testing may be required by the fda in order to commercialize our products and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the product cost prohibitive for our company or our partners such delay or failure to launch these products could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability   failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales the requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs in connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements   the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda office of inspector general department of justice doj and the federal trade commission the doj and the securities and exchange commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently are considered government officials foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally the laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our proposed products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations            we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment changes in applicable laws regulations and policies may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   the laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations changes in healthcare laws implementing regulations and policies could impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states may adversely affect our business   the patient protection and affordable care act the “healthcare reform act” which was signed into law in march  includes several provisions which may impact our business in the united states including increased medicaid rebates reimbursement changes and an expansion of the b drug pricing program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices we may also experience downward pricing pressure on our proposed products as the healthcare reform act reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals while the healthcare reform act is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally the longterm impact of the act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain these changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the healthcare reform act’s provisions   the successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies if reimbursement for our future products is reduced or modified in the united states or abroad our business could suffer   sales of our proposed products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private parties and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers such as government insurance programs including medicare and medicaid private health insurers health maintenance organizations and other healthcare related organizations these public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any new drug and in turn the price that we will be able to charge we are unable to predict all the changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or public thirdparty payers any denial of thirdparty coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue the downward pricing pressures we may experience from thirdparty payers could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results   austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products accordingly reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us if future reimbursement for our approved product candidates is substantially less than we project or if rebate obligations associated with our products are substantially increased our business and commercial opportunities could be materially and adversely affected   if we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged   patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated in our technology and products we cannot guarantee that any proposed or pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from developing and marketing certain products or including key features in the company’s products            our issued and future patents may be challenged narrowed invalidated or circumvented which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar technology or products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our technology or products changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the united states and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection in addition the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states as a result our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing technology or products similar or identical to ours   in order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties there also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that our technology or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights this can entail significant costs to us and divert our management’s attention from developing and commercializing our technology or products any such claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel andor require us to pay substantial damages a loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could materially affect future results of operations   in addition to patented technology we will also rely on unpatented proprietary technology trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public we generally seek to protect this type of proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants scientific advisors contractors and third parties however these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach in addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors to the extent that our employees consultants scientific advisors or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position may cause us to incur substantial costs and may have a material impact on our business and financial condition   we may be unable to attract revenuegenerating collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to advance our technology and products if our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected   we do not possess all of the financial and developmental resources necessary to develop and commercialize the products that may result from our technologies accordingly we will need to make arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize product candidates that may be approved our business strategy includes obtaining collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our nanotechnology platforms and drug candidates we may not be able to attract such partnerships and even if we are able to enter into such strategic partnerships the terms may be less favorable than anticipated furthermore entering into such partnership arrangements may limit our commercialization options and flexibility and the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates under such arrangements will depend largely on the efforts of third parties if we do not find appropriate partners or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected   as part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities these activities may result in substantial investment of our resources our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other company’s underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected            credit market uncertainty could have a significant impact on our business   significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms accordingly we may be limited in our ability to borrow funds to finance our operations in the future an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse effect on our planned business operations and financial condition   our business is subject to risks of terrorist acts acts of war political unrest public health concerns labor disputes and natural disasters   terrorist acts acts of war political unrest public health concerns labor disputes or national disasters may disrupt our operations as well as those of our customers these types of acts have created and continue to create economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability future terrorist activities military or security operations or natural disasters could weaken the domestic and global economies and create additional uncertainties thus forcing our customers to reduce their capital spending or cancel or delay already planned construction projects which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition including loss of sales or customers   the expected results from our previously disclosed potential merger with newgen biopharma corporation may vary significantly from our expectations and we can provide no assurance that such potential merger will be completed   the expected results from our potential merger transaction with newgen nj might vary materially from those anticipated and disclosed by us and we can provide no assurance that such potential merger will be completed these expectations are inherently subject to uncertainties and contingencies these assumptions may be impacted by factors that are beyond our control including the business of newgen nj the us economy our ability to obtain financing to complete the merger with newgen nj and the approval of the potential merger by newgen nj’s board of directors and stockholders any one of these factors may result in our failure to complete the potential merger and such failure to complete the potential merger may have significant adverse consequences on our ability to operate and survive as a viable entity   there can be no assurance that the proposed merger will in fact be consummated and any failure to consummate such a transaction may adversely impact our ability to generate liquidity for our stockholders and to raise necessary capital   we have entered into a binding letter of intent with newgen nj dated as of october   which contains various conditions including approval by newgen nj’s stockholders and the entry into definitive agreements there can be no assurance that the proposed merger transaction will be consummated even if we are able to close the potential merger transaction there is no assurance that we will be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms andor that a public market for its securities will develop   risks relating to our securities and our status as a public company   the relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage   our management team lacks public company experience and is generally unfamiliar with the requirements of the united states securities laws and us generally accepted accounting principles which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by sarbanesoxley act of  the individual who holds all of the principal officer positions of the company has never had responsibility for managing a publicly traded company such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and distract our management from attending to the growth of our business            shares of our common stock that have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended regardless of whether such shares are restricted or unrestricted are subject to resale restrictions imposed by rule  including those set forth in rule i which apply to a “shell company” in addition any shares of our common stock that are held by affiliates including any received in a registered offering will be subject to the resale restrictions of rule i   pursuant to rule  of the securities act of  as amended “rule ” a “shell company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets as such we may be deemed a “shell company” pursuant to rule  prior to the potential merger and as such sales of our securities pursuant to rule  are not able to be made until a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date on which our current report on form k is filed with the sec reflecting our status as a non“shell company” therefore any restricted securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the sec andor until a year after the date of the filing of our current report on form k and we have otherwise complied with the other requirements of rule  as a result it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our employees and consultants with our securities instead of cash furthermore it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the sec which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future our previous status as a “shell company” could prevent us from raising additional funds engaging employees and consultants and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions although none are currently planned which could cause the value of our securities if any to decline in value or become worthless lastly any shares held by affiliates including shares received in any registered offering will be subject to the resale restrictions of rule i   we will be required to incur significant costs and require significant management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act and any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on our stock price   as a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  “section ” section  requires us to include an internal control report with our annual report on form k this report must include management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year this report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified failure to comply or any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities as of october   the management of the company assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments management concluded as of the year ended october   that its internal controls and procedures were effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules achieving continued compliance with section  may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources no assurance can be given that we will be able to fully comply with section  or that we and our independent registered public accounting firm would be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end as a result investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities as well as subject us to civil or criminal investigations and penalties in addition our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management’s assessment or conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively            if we lose our key management personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives and such loss could adversely affect our business future operations and financial condition   our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key consultants and upon our ability to attract and retain senior management and scientists with relevant expertise if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key consultants or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives we do not have “keyman” life insurance policies on our key executives if we lose the services of any of our key consultants we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel which could harm our business the loss of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees may adversely affect our business future operations and financial condition   the elimination of monetary liability against our directors officers and employees under nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors officers and employees   our bylaws contain a provision permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors to our company and stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by nevada law the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers which we may be unable to recoup these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions if successful might otherwise benefit our company and stockholders   our stock is categorized as a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the sec’s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   our stock is categorized as a penny stock the sec has adopted rule g which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than us  per share or an exercise price of less than us  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock            finra sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   in addition to the “penny stock” rules described above finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers the finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares   to date we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future   we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends even if the funds are legally available for distribution we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends we presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations   our common stock is not listed on any stock exchange and there is no established market for shares of our common stock even if a market for our common stock develops our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations   our common stock is not listed on any stock exchange although our common stock is quoted on the otcbb there is no established public market for shares of our common stock even if the shares of our common stock may in the future trade on the otcbb the liquidity and price of our common stock is expected to be more limited than if such securities were quoted or listed on a national exchange no assurances can be given that an active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained the trading volume we develop on the otcbb may be limited by the fact that many major institutional investment funds including mutual funds as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in bulletin board stocks and certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending bulletin board stocks because they are considered speculative volatile and thinly traded lack of liquidity will limit the price at which stockholders may be able to sell our common stock   the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results announcements by us or others developments affecting us and other events or factors in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many companies often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies and may adversely affect the market prices of the securities such risks could have an adverse affect on the stock’s future liquidity   if we issue additional shares in the future it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of common stock with a par value of  per share our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or assets and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements the issuance of any such shares may reduce the
