solutions ltd urging termination of hlsss relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc outlines hlsss opportunity to generate significant value for shareholders by forcing servicing transfers away from ocwenannounces intention to nominate a slate of directors to the hlss board for election at the companys  annual meeting feb    et from mangrove partners new york feb   prnewswire  the mangrove partners master fund ltd a significant shareholder of home loan servicing solutions ltd nasdaq hlss today announced it has delivered a letter to the members of hlsss board of directors the full text of the letter follows and has been posted to wwwfreehlsscom the board of directors home loan servicing solutions ltd co intertrust corporate services cayman limited  elgin avenue george town grand cayman ky cayman islands cc  michael lubin corporate secretary dear members of the board we are writing you in response to your letter dated february   response based on the latest publicly available shareholdings list the mangrove partners master fund ltd mangrove partners is one of the ten largest shareholders of home loan servicing solutions ltd hlss or the company as we expressed in our february   letter we believe it is imperative for the company to exercise its contractual rights to terminate its relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc ocwen without delay we believe that continuing to expose hlss to ocwenrelated risks by leaving the ocwen relationship intact constitutes a dereliction of your duty to the company and a grave risk to all shareholders your response was inadequate as a result it is our intention to nominate a slate of replacement directors for election this year because time is not the companys friend and you as the board are showing no signs of taking concrete action to protect shareholders in this serious situation  we believe that there have been multiple termination events under the documents governing hlsss purchase of rights to msrs rmsrs from ocwen pursuant to each sale supplement governing hlsss purchase of rmsrs from ocwen a termination event is defined as the occurrence of any one or more of the following events…e seller ocwen fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least average by standard  poors rating services…sq by moodys investors service inc moodys…and rps and rss by fitch ratings a termination event therefore occurred on january   when moodys downgraded ocwens servicer quality sq assessments to sq from sq and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to sq from sq another termination event occurred on february   when fitch ratings downgraded ocwens residential primary servicer rating for subprime product to rps from rps section  of the sales supplements specifies that in the case that any termination event occurs with respect to any servicing agreement… ocwen shall upon hlsss written direction to such effect use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the servicing rights relating to any affected servicing agreement to a third party servicer identified by hlss importantly section  of the sales supplements then proceeds to state that hlss shall be entitled to receive all proceeds of such transfer emphasis added we believe that there are compelling reasons why hlss should immediately begin the process of exercising its rights to direct ocwen to transfer the servicing rights to one or more different servicers most importantly servicing transfers will isolate hlss from the risks of an ongoing relationship with ocwen a number of these risks were outlined in our prior letter to you you are no doubt aware that moodys downgraded hlsss corporate family rating from ba to b on october   citing hlsss reliance on ocwen as the primary reason for the downgrade additionally we remind you that the california department of business oversight threatened to suspend ocwens servicing license multiple times during  it is our belief that hlsss continued affiliation with ocwen is an unacceptable risk and contrary to the best interests of the company and its shareholders we believe that restructuring hlsss servicing counterparty relationships would be a significant positive development for the company in the current operating environment and would be viewed positively by all of the companys lending relationships transferring servicing would give hlss the opportunity to engage with servicers that have greater servicing stability better management oversight stronger relationships with regulators and higher ratings in addition to shielding hlss shareholders from ocwenrelated risks we believe that a transfer of the servicing rights will create significant value for hlss and its shareholders while our valuation work shows a range of potential values we believe that a reasonable estimate of the value created by transferring the servicing rights would be between  and  per share of incremental value to hlss  based on the companys book value on september   this represents an increase in book value of between  and  in addition we believe the companys stock is currently trading at a discounted multiple due to the companys close ties to ocwen once the company ends its association with ocwen we see no reason why the company would not return to trading at its historic multiple of between  and  of book value in a reasonable scenario this would give shareholders a value of between  and  per share we have included our analysis of the value available to hlss with a servicing transfer in the appendix to this letter although you may be concerned that hlsss exercise of its rights to force servicing transfers could create further instability at ocwen mangrove partners believes that ocwens cash flows would only be affected after the servicing transfers are completed likewise while the servicing transfers away from ocwen would likely cause ocwen to turn lossmaking and give rise to multiple covenant breaches in ocwens credit facility pursuant to section a and b of the ocwen senior secured term loan facility agreement dated february   these breaches would occur only after substantially all servicing transfers requested by hlss had been completed as such any ensuing ocwen default would be irrelevant to hlss and the companys remaining exposure to ocwen would be de minimis we urge you to fulfill your fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the company by causing the company to exercise its contractual rights to force a transfer of the servicing rights in doing so the board can and should insulate hlss from further ocwen risk and create substantial value for the company and its shareholders your responses vague reassurances and legal boilerplate did nothing to ease mangrove partners increasing and justified concerns about the direction of the company to be clear we are not looking for you to make selective disclosure to us—we are looking for you to take prudent action to protect the company and shareholder interests accordingly until such time as the company announces it has entered into definitive agreements to transfer the servicing rights away from ocwen pursuant to competitive processes conducted by toptier advisors it is our intention to bring new leadership to the board by nominating a highly qualified slate of directors this week sincerely nathaniel august president and portfolio manager mangrove partners valuation appendix  ocwen profits as servicer on msrs for which hlss funds advances ocwen acts as servicer for all of the rmsrs that hlss owns we believe that ocwen earns significant profits from this relationship our analysis of the value accruing to ocwen as servicer for hlss rmsrs is below and assumes that ocwens profitability on agency and nonagency msr are equal as a percentage of upb serviced we note that ocwen management has indicated that agency servicing is significantly less profitable than nonagency servicing and that ocwen

hlss has the right to transfer would be worth over  in incremental value per hlss share  we have benchmarked our valuation against what hlss has indicated it believes ocwen earns on this relationship on june   hlss indicated in a lender presentation that ocwen earns a contribution profit of  bps of upb as servicer on hlss rmsrs as shown below this suggests that our valuation of ocwens servicing

  conference call ocwen stated that it owns call rights as the servicer of almost  billion of upb of private label mortgages…we estimate that we will execute approximately  billion of calls over the next two years and they could be worth two to three points of profit to ocwen since these clean up call rights belong to the servicer of the private label mortgages their value should accrue to hlss

 hlss clean up call profit  high   value of cleanup call rights per hlss share – high  based on the guidance given by ocwens management it is mangrove partners opinion that the clean up call rights to which hlss is entitled could be worth at least  per share taking into consideration only those clean up call rights that were inthemoney as of december   altisource portfolio solutions sa asps profits from ocwens nonagency portfolio in january  asps provided estimates of potential technology and mortgage services pretax income it expects to generate from ocwens existing nongse portfolio we believe that substantially all of this pretax income is generated from ocwens nonagency portfolio hlss owns the rmsrs to over  of ocwens nonagency servicing portfolio a third party servicer to which hlss transfers servicing could derive significant value from performing the services that asps is currently performing and we believe that hlss could be compensated for this in the sale price of the servicing rights our estimate of the value another servicer could realize from the cash flows that asps forecast in its recent presentation is presented below  in millions      segment pretax income

projections the cash flows that a buyer of the msrs could realize may be worth over  per hlss share although this value would likely be divided between hlss and the msr purchaser it may also be conservative because it excludes earnings related to mortgage chargeoff collection services that would likely be valuable to another servicer  transaction comparable in january  ocwen agreed to acquire a primarily private label mortgage servicing portfolio from wells fargo with total principal balance of  billion the wells fargo portfolio the agreedupon purchase price was  billion including

hlss could receive in a sale to a third party wells fargo transaction valuation  millions amount total upb to be acquired  msr purchase price   of upb to be acquired deal multiple  advance for

implied fair value of msr assets  less  hlss rmsr carrying value  potential gain to hlss  ÷ hlss shares outstanding at   value per hlss share  we note that this analysis does not take into account the cost of capital associated with deferred servicing fees that ocwen agreed to pay up front nor the difference in servicing advance requirements between the wells fargo portfolio and the rmsrs that hlss currently owns servicing advances as a percentage of hlsss rmsr upb stood at  at september   compared to servicing advances as a percentage of upb in the wells fargo portfolio of  also the hlss portfolio is entirely private label whereas over  of the upb associated with the wells fargo portfolio was fannie mae or freddie mac servicing this suggests that based on a comparable transaction analysis hlsss exercise of its right to transfer servicing away from ocwen could result in a gain to hlss shareholders well in excess of  per share this gain would represent an increase of approximately  to hlsss september   book value per share  hlsss rmsrs are valued on its balance sheet using assumptions that are more conservative than realized performance a servicing transfer that

backstop commitment letter on or about january   the commitment parties submitted a restructuring proposal to the company but the company informed the commitment parties of certain concerns it had

backstop commitment letter the commitment parties and the debtors will cooperate and negotiate in good faith the terms of a longform agreement the backstop commitment agreement consistent with the terms of the backstop commitment letter that would supersede the backstop commitment letter under the backstop commitment letter the commitment parties have committed among other things to exercise

provide a portion of the financing for a proposed restructuring of the debtors contemplated by the backstop commitment letter the alternative transaction the alternative transaction would be different from the plan of reorganization filed by the debtors with the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of missouri the bankruptcy court on december   the alternative transaction is described in the plan term sheet attached as exhibit c to the backstop commitment letter pursuant to the alternative transaction each holder of equity including the master fund of the company will receive its pro rata share of warrants for  of the shares of reorganized peabody exercisable for seven years at a valuation at which convertible noteholders receive a par recovery the price per share in the rights offering is to be determined using a plan enterprise value of  the plan enterprise value and applying a  discount thereto the master fund believes that the actual enterprise value of the debtors is substantially higher than the plan enterprise value but agreed to become a commitment party for the investment opportunity of acquiring equity of reorganized peabody at a price substantially lower than its intrinsic value in addition the alternative transaction contemplates among other things that i each holder of an allowed first lien lender claim will receive its aggregate pro rata share of cash equal to the full amount of its allowed first lien lender claims including interest at the default rate ii each holder of an allowed second lien notes claim will receive either a reinstatement of any allowed second lien notes claim or b an option to exchange such second lien notes for its pro rata share based on  of the allowed second lien note claims of x  million in cash  of the stated principal amount of the second lien notes excluding accrued and unpaid interest and y  of the shares in reorganized peabody which shall be subject to dilution as described in the plan term sheet iii each holder of an allowed unsecured senior notes claim will receive the holders pro rata share of a  of shares of reorganized peabody less any shares of reorganized peabody that holders of allowed second lien notes claims elect to receive which shall be subject to dilution as described in the plan term sheet and b the section  equity rights and iv each holder of convertible notes will receive its pro rata share of warrants for  of shares of reorganized peabody exercisable for seven years at a valuation at which participating holders of allowed unsecured senior notes claims receive a par recovery participants in the rights offering will also be granted oversubscription rights such that any subscription rights that remain unfilled by the participants of the rights offering may be subscribed for by other rights offering participants the obligations of the debtors to issue shares in the rights offering and of the commitment parties to purchase their commitments contemplated by the backstop commitment letter are subject to certain conditions including among other things i execution and delivery by the commitment parties and the debtors of the backstop commitment agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the requisite number of commitment parties and the debtors ii consummation of the transactions contemplated by the backstop commitment letter and iii receipt of final orders from the bankruptcy court approving the transactions contemplated by the backstop commitment letter in exchange for their commitments to exercise any unfilled subscription rights the commitment parties would receive among other things a backstop commitment premium payable in the form of new common stock of reorganized peabody and penny warrants for shares of reorganized peabody the backstop commitment letter is subject to termination i automatically upon execution and delivery of the backstop commitment agreement ii upon approval or authorization by the bankruptcy court of any reorganization or similar transaction other than the alternative transaction or if the debtors enter into any agreement providing for any such transaction iii on april   which date may be extended or waived but not to a date later than june   in certain circumstances iv if the board of directors of peabody energy corporation determines in good faith based upon the advice of outside legal counsel that continued performance under the backstop commitment letter would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and v upon the occurrence of material breaches of a partys representations warranties or covenants contained in the backstop commitment letter if such breaches remain uncured for

solutions ltd urging termination of hlsss relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc outlines hlsss opportunity to generate significant value for shareholders by forcing servicing transfers away from ocwen announces intention to nominate a slate of directors to the hlss board for election at the companys  annual meeting feb   am est new york feb   prnewswire  the mangrove partners master fund ltd a significant shareholder of home loan servicing solutions ltd nasdaq hlss today announced it has delivered a letter to the members of hlsss board of directors the full text of the letter follows and has been posted to wwwfreehlsscom the board of directorshome loan servicing solutions ltdco intertrust corporate services cayman limited elgin avenuegeorge town grand cayman kycayman islands cc  michael lubin corporate secretary dear members of the board we are writing you in response to your letter dated february   response based on the latest publicly available shareholdings list the mangrove partners master fund ltd mangrove partners is one of the ten largest shareholders of home loan servicing solutions ltd hlss or the company as we expressed in our february   letter we believe it is imperative for the company to exercise its contractual rights to terminate its relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc ocwen without delay we believe that continuing to expose hlss to ocwenrelated risks by leaving the ocwen relationship intact constitutes a dereliction of your duty to the company and a grave risk to all shareholders your response was inadequate as a result it is our intention to nominate a slate of replacement directors for election this year because time is not the companys friend and you as the board are showing no signs of taking concrete action to protect shareholders in this serious situation  we believe that there have been multiple termination events under the documents governing hlsss purchase of rights to msrs rmsrs from ocwen pursuant to each sale supplement governing hlsss purchase of rmsrs from ocwen a termination event is defined as the occurrence of any one or more of the following events…e seller ocwen fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least average by standard  poors rating services…sq by moodys investors service inc moodys…and rps and rss by fitch ratings a termination event therefore occurred on january   when moodys downgraded ocwens servicer quality sq assessments to sq from sq and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to sq from sq another termination event occurred on february   when fitch ratings downgraded ocwens residential primary servicer rating for subprime product to rps from rps section  of the sales supplements specifies that in the case that any termination event occurs with respect to any servicing agreement… ocwen shall upon hlsss written direction to such effect use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the servicing rights relating to any affected servicing agreement to a third party servicer identified by hlss importantly section  of the sales supplements then proceeds to state that hlss shall be entitled to receive all proceeds of such transfer emphasis added we believe that there are compelling reasons why hlss should immediately begin the process of exercising its rights to direct ocwen to transfer the servicing rights to one or more different servicers most importantly servicing transfers will isolate hlss from the risks of an ongoing relationship with ocwen a number of these risks were outlined in our prior letter to you you are no doubt aware that moodys downgraded hlsss corporate family rating from ba to b on october   citing hlsss reliance on ocwen as the primary reason for the downgrade additionally we remind you that the california department of business oversight threatened to suspend ocwens servicing license multiple times during  it is our belief that hlsss continued affiliation with ocwen is an unacceptable risk and contrary to the best interests of the company and its shareholders we believe that restructuring hlsss servicing counterparty relationships would be a significant positive development for the company in the current operating environment and would be viewed positively by all of the companys lending relationships transferring servicing would give hlss the opportunity to engage with servicers that have greater servicing stability better management oversight stronger relationships with regulators and higher ratings in addition to shielding hlss shareholders from ocwenrelated risks we believe that a transfer of the servicing rights will create significant value for hlss and its shareholders while our valuation work shows a range of potential values we believe that a reasonable estimate of the value created by transferring the servicing rights would be between  and  per share of incremental value to hlss  based on the companys book value on september   this represents an increase in book value of between  and  in addition we believe the companys stock is currently trading at a discounted multiple due to the companys close ties to ocwen once the company ends its association with ocwen we see no reason why the company would not return to trading at its historic multiple of between  and  of book value in a reasonable scenario this would give shareholders a value of between  and  per share we have included our analysis of the value available to hlss with a servicing transfer in the appendix to this letter although you may be concerned that hlsss exercise of its rights to force servicing transfers could create further instability at ocwen mangrove partners believes that ocwens cash flows would only be affected after the servicing transfers are completed likewise while the servicing transfers away from ocwen would likely cause ocwen to turn lossmaking and give rise to multiple covenant breaches in ocwens credit facility pursuant to section a and b of the ocwen senior secured term loan facility agreement dated february   these breaches would occur only after substantially all servicing transfers requested by hlss had been completed as such any ensuing ocwen default would be irrelevant to hlss and the companys remaining exposure to ocwen would be de minimis we urge you to fulfill your fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the company by causing the company to exercise its contractual rights to force a transfer of the servicing rights in doing so the board can and should insulate hlss from further ocwen risk and create substantial value for the company and its shareholders your responses vague reassurances and legal boilerplate did nothing to ease mangrove partners increasing and justified concerns about the direction of the company to be clear we are not looking for you to make selective disclosure to us—we are looking for you to take prudent action to protect the company and shareholder interests accordingly until such time as the company announces it has entered into definitive agreements to transfer the servicing rights away from ocwen pursuant to competitive processes conducted by toptier advisors it is our intention to bring new leadership to the board by nominating a highly qualified slate of directors this week sincerely nathaniel augustpresident and portfolio

indicated in a lender presentation that ocwen earns a contribution profit of  bps of upb as servicer on hlss rmsrs as shown below this suggests that our valuation of ocwens servicing relationship with

clean up call profit  high   value of cleanup call rights per hlss share – high  based on the guidance given by ocwens management it is mangrove partners opinion that the clean up call rights to which

substantially all of this pretax income is generated from ocwens nonagency portfolio hlss owns the rmsrs to over  of ocwens nonagency servicing portfolio a third party servicer to which hlss transfers servicing could derive significant value from performing the services that asps is currently performing and we believe that hlss could be compensated for this in the sale price of the servicing rights

label mortgage servicing portfolio from wells fargo with total principal balance of  billion the wells fargo portfolio the agreedupon purchase price was  billion including  million for the msr

servicing advances as a percentage of hlsss rmsr upb stood at  at september   compared to servicing advances as a percentage of upb in the wells fargo portfolio of  also the hlss portfolio is entirely private label whereas over  of the upb associated with the wells fargo portfolio was fannie mae or freddie mac servicing this suggests that based on a comparable transaction analysis hlsss exercise of

that there is opportunity to generate significant value for shareholders by transferring servicing rights away from ocwen feb    et from mangrove partners master fund ltd new york feb   prnewswire  the mangrove partners master fund ltd mangrove a significant shareholder of home loan servicing solutions ltd nasdaq hlss today announced it has formally nominated five highly qualified and independent director nominees — nathaniel august kevin j doyle john s dubel a jay meyerson and amy c schumacher — for election to the board of directors of hlss at its upcoming  annual general meeting of shareholders nathaniel august the founder and president of mangrove partners and a nominee stated as we have previously explained to the board we have serious concerns that this board is exposing hlss shareholders to potentially significant value destruction through the companys continued relationship with ocwen we believe that ending the companys relationship with ocwen both protects shareholders from value destruction and moreover has the potential to generate significant additional value our valuation work leads us to believe that transferring the servicing rights away from ocwen could create significant value for hlss — between  and  per share of incremental value to hlss in our reasonable estimation based on the companys book value on september   this would represent an increase in book value of between  and   mr august continued but instead of action this board has provided us with nothing more than vague assurances that it has been working to address these issues given the significant value destruction that shareholders are facing coupled with the valuecreating opportunity this board appears intent on wasting empty promises and ambiguous commitments are moot that is why we are taking the extraordinary step of nominating a slate of five highly qualified independent nominees to the board who we believe will be committed to completing the strategic actions necessary to protect and enhance shareholder value at hlss mr august concluded while we remain open to further discussion with the board and are amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that benefits all shareholders we remain firm in our position on this matter — hlss must terminate its relationship with ocwen if this board continues to refuse to take action we look
