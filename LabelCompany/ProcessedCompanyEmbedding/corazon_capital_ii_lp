that having cut its ties to the fallen dawnay day group the firm is planning to expand its geographic reach and target new platformbased institutional and retail distribution channels with a target of reaching assets under management of up to usdbn hw what is the background to your company rm corazon capital is an independent asset manager providing tailored investment solutions and a range of unitised investment products to private and institutional investors established in  corazon is a pioneer in the field of absolute return investing and manages usdbn of client money corazon is wholly owned by senior management based in guernsey jersey geneva and london the comanaging directors are paul meader as chief executive and myself as chief investment officer hw who are your key service providers rm grant thornton is our accountant and ozannes our legal advisor both of them local guernsey firms fortis undertakes our fund administration and deutsche bank acts as custodian hw have you made any recent launches or changes to the management team rm this year has been an exciting one for corazon we have recruited key individuals to be cornerstones of our business going forward  chris trower has been recruited from nedbank as director of sales and marketing barrie duerden joined from rothschild lcf to establish our recentlyopened office in geneva and ryan mendy has been brought on board to develop relations in the uk intermediaryinstitutional marketplace we have enhanced our research team with a specialist real estate analyst and also expanded our client services team building on our experience in the absolute return arena and encouraged by investor demand for a vehicle to focus purely on the alternative space in september we launched new share classes of the corazon alternative investment fund hw what is your investment process rm the corazon investment approach centres on an unrestrained multiasset multistrategy style we have the flexibility to allocate across asset classes and investment styles to cash bonds equities property commodities hedge funds and other alternative assets  but will only allocate to an asset class if we believe that it will generate positive returns with the right risk characteristics in congruence with the portfolio our overall objective is to preserve capital achieve high relative returns and limit risk through low or uncorrelated asset class and style blending our investment process is twofold corazons investment managers who draw on a diverse range of experience form the asset allocation committee they meet regularly to review and debate tactical asset allocation the asset allocation of a portfoliofund is forwardlooking and discretionary and based on topdown macroeconomic and modelled inputs together with bottomup managerdriven influences taking this asset allocation framework it is the responsibility of the fund selection committee through quantitative and qualitative research to approve funds for investment and to ensure there are sufficient quality funds to execute any modifications to the asset allocation strategy hw how has your fund of hedge funds performed rm the corazon alternative investment fund has returned minus  per cent this year up to the end of september while admittedly not showing an absolute return for the period it must be viewed in the context of equity markets down more than  per cent from their peaks commodities down  per cent and more property down around  per cent and listed entities up to  per cent and corporate bonds having been pummelled as well we believe this identifies the strength in our investment approach and the skill of our investment managers if we do not lose a great deal of value during difficult times we do not have to take excessive risk during the good times to provide strong annualised returns to investors historically this fund has provided consistent annualised returns in line with its target of cash plus  to  per cent with volatility of less than  per cent hw how many funds and strategies are in your portfolio rm we take an unconstrained approach when allocating to hedge fund strategies this ensures true investment manager conviction in identifying suitable strategies and funds that contribute the appropriate risk and return characteristics to a portfolio for example our portfolios are currently positioned to benefit from noncorrelated strategies that do not require capital markets to prosper to make money such as a power trader in norway macro managers insurancebased strategies and trade finance typically we allocate to between eight and  strategies with  to  managers in each portfolio hw are you linked to any hedge fund indices or have you launched products linked to indices rm no all our portfolios are managed on an absolute return basis while we do use typical indices for comparison our primary benchmark is asset risk consultants private client indices these provide an accurate insight and comparison of the riskadjusted real returns achieved by peer group investment managers for their discretionary portfolios understanding the absolute return process and the levels of risk employed by individual managers is extremely difficult for investors the arc indices provide an impartial assessment of real value added and ranks our performance against that of our competitors hw what makes a manager or strategy special enough to select them rm alpha and im not being flippant alpha exists to us it means the profits a manager can earn because they do at least one thing better than the competition that may be security selection although most stocks and bonds are so well picked over that security selection alpha is quite low or it could be use of balance sheet as in managers who know better than peers when to expand or contract gross and net exposures that particular skill has separated the experts from the keen amateurs in the past year we have an ongoing search for strategy alpha too its easier to get excess returns if you can find a strategy that is undercapitalised because even a thirdquartile manager may deliver sufficient riskadjusted return with an overcapitalised strategy you have to be confident of picking a topquartile manager or better but eventually all industries with excess capital have to retrench in industrial sectors capital destruction can take years but in finance the capital degradation happens overnight we like to be on our way out when that happens hw what are your criteria for removing managers from the fund rm we sell if we have an expectation of negative alpha in either the manager or the strategy nothing good lasts forever and we try to be longterm investors but excess profits attract excess capital as capital became easier to get and almost free many strategies looked increasingly vulnerable to us meyer weinstein was the only investor hedging convertible bonds in the s so he had all the manager and strategy alphas to himself he published a book about it in  creating his own competition our job is not dissimilar to that of a stock analyst we try to find the marginal competitor in a strategy and decide whether they are creating or destroying value just because young merger arbitrageurs thought working a few big transactions at an investment bank was their competitive edge does not make them alpha creators hw how many managers do you have on the substitutes bench rm in strategies that we consider fully capitalised we have one manager as an alternate to those in the strategy this is natural because the strategy alpha is low and we want a manager that keeps his risk constant and lets the return vary the majority of peers will try to keep return constant by varying risk which exposes them to a socalled shock the event is in fact predictable capital destruction unfortunately its timing is random even chaotic with strategies that are undercapitalised we will have smaller allocations to more managers and perhaps two or three alternates if we can find them the logic behind increased diversification is that we know less about the strategy and what can go wrong and often the managers arent realistic about risks either so as soon as a manager deviates from expectation we redeem in part or in full and allocate to the next best hw what events do you expect to see in your sector in the year ahead rm the reallocation of capital between the financial markets and the real economy from west to east and from goods consumers to producers will continue until a new equilibrium is reached the implication of these trends is there will be less financial capital to manage so the world will need fewer financial experts of all types reallocation of labour to more productive sectors always seems so benign in textbooks but when you receive valedictory emails from people you have worked with in many institutions over the years you cannot but be sympathetic that is why we analyse our business processes regularly to ensure that we do not become the marginal producer it is crucial we identify and buttress our own competitive advantages hw how will these developments affect your own portfolios rm the wholesale winnowing of financial services presents tremendous opportunities to us in terms of new business to be won and for higher returns from all investments in the future we have recently invested a significant sum of money in the technology required to service clients reporting needs and to help us manage larger assets under management without increasing bureaucracy the result is that we can stay close to our clients and maintain real contact with our managers a current favourite investment thesis is the disparity between the earnings expectations priced into global debt versus the expectations for equities both can be wrong simultaneously but both cant be right simultaneously in brief bonds are priced for a prolonged recession whereas equities of the same entities are priced for slower growth as the effects of monetary and fiscal stimuli become clearer one must converge upon the other in the meantime we carry some basis risk but at some point the bonds will rise relative to equities irrespective of the actual direction of markets hw what differentiates you from other managers in your sector rm corazon is a pioneer of absolute return investing with a track record going back more than  years and very few competitors are able to prove their methodology in this way sixty per cent of our  members of staff are investment professionals and between them they average more than  years industry experience each being wholly owned by management and not restrained by the ties that encumber larger companies coupled with our boutique size means we are able to be nimble dynamic and decisive hw what is you attitude toward risk rm we are not concerned by fund managers taking risk but we ensure when we allocate to a manger that they are taking the right types of risk risk management is central to our process correlations inevitably start to rise at times of material financial stress such as the period since july  in this regard traditional var style analysis is too narrowly focused is historic and provides no insight into other key variables such as liquidity whilst we do use quantitative risk management systems we believe that a qualitative overlay based on the significant market experience of our investment managers provides a robust and reliable risk management process we keep in very close contact with all our managers and modify our exposure or redeem where we perceive there are good reasons for doing so as we all have learned nothing including bank deposits is riskfree yet many of our underlying funds are doing well in the current climate hw how would you assess investors expectations and how do you deal with them rm we are very proud that our core business has been driven by private clients word of mouth and personal recommendation this speaks volumes we take time to fully understand client requirements and carefully construct portfolios accordingly throughout these difficult times it has been more important than ever for us to manage investors expectations realistically we have made no false promises but rather have been pragmatic and open about how we see the world and the decisions we have made to position portfolios to take advantage of the best opportunities for recovery hw how do you distribute your products rm corazon has grown from a multifamily style firm in the early days to be in a position now to embrace  and beyond with a focused international business development plan this will be built upon the backbone of business derived by word of mouth and the strength of relationships we have locally in the
