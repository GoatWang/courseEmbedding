news media article and photos by aallyah wright saturday may   featured in mississippitodayorg university � pulitzer prizewinning historian jon meacham and nbc news chairman andy lack said friday that president donald trump�s long experience with tv and new york tabloids was used deftly by him to curry favor with voters in �real america� who were not covered closely by the news media �he doesn�t hate the media and he doesn�t hate the news world at all fake news notwithstanding� said lack �he actually loves it he can�t get enough of it he is just a creature of tv� said meacham �he knows our news media dna he knows the press by and large is like second graders at a soccer game  everyone chases the ball and nobody stays in position� their comments came in an engaging hourlong conversation at the university of mississippi presented by mississippi today and sponsored by the overby center for southern journalism and politics and the meek school of journalism and new media in may of  meacham and lack separately sat down for conversations with trump in trump tower their observations of him from those talks permeated the first half hour of the conversation �he spent the first half hour talking about another politician and an actor who was replacing him on the apprentice  arnold schwarzenegger� said lack �we talked about the possibility that arnold�s ratings might be worse than his for about  minutes� the point is lack said trump �knew every detail there was to know about the ratings� he used that knowledge and parlayed that with his willingness to engage with the news media he said �we got criticism in the media � you elected trump because you never stopped covering his rallies you never stopped putting him on tv� lack noted he said the reality was the news media didn�t actually do that as much as many thought �the point was he was so accessible and he wanted to tell his story� lack said hillary did not � it was very difficult very challenging to get her to do anything� �he is a cable news addict literally� noted meacham lack noted a comment by meacham this week in which he said trump �is not about the art of the deal he is about the art of the headline� lack did some selfreflection on the role of the media �i think the biggest story that we missed certainly nbc we underestimated the dislike of hillary in the country� said lack �the skepticism was so deep and i think particularly if you were in the bubble in new york or hollywood you just had no idea and we didn�t cover that well� if the press failed to convey trump�s real chances of winning the presidency it was due to lack of coverage of his voters said lack meacham disagreed to a point he noted that over the past  years the american public�s confidence in washington has declined from  percent to  percent today or from three out of four having confidence that the political and governmental institutions in washington will do the right thing to less than one and five having that confidence today �there�s nobody in america at least who�s remotely swayable who didn�t know what we were getting with the th president� said meacham �to some extent the country looked at washington and said if you�re going to act like a reality tv show we�re going to send you a reality tv show� when visiting trump tower last may meacham said he noticed a family of three �mother father and son � walk through the revolving doors he said the son asked his father�do you think he trump goes through the door we just came in� the father replied�oh no i bet he has a secret entrance� meacham said which left the boy in total awe as if trump was a heroic figure like batman coming to save the day �it was a small moment it should�ve triggered something more profound in me� said meacham lack is the founder of mississippi today and is on the company�s board of directors meacham is on mississippi today�s advisory board and was the commencement speaker at the university of mississippi on saturday meacham and lack both talked about the importance of a president�s characteristics and how it factors into the presidency during that sit down meacham said he admired trump for his honesty �i walk in the room and he says �it�s an honor to be interviewed by you i�ve never read any of your books but you�re great on tv� � said meacham �and i appreciated the candor� �what secretary clinton would have said is �oh i read your book on �x� and it changed my view on �y� and she would have been lying and i would have known she was lying� meacham noted that in the white house all presidents are surrounded by portraits of former presidents and in the workspaces are pictures of themselves �the president�s see as they wish to be seen and they live in a house of history� said meacham �they live in a reinforcing sophistic atmosphere so we wonder why they�re all crazy� noting trump�s recent comments that president andrew jackson had he lived long enough could have prevented the civil war lack sought a response from meacham whose biography of jackson american lion andrew jackson in the white house earned meacham the  pulitzer prize for biography as meacham noted that trump told him in their conversation that he had cancelled a golf match to binge watch ken burns� the civil war on netflix �which is so improbable and think it is probably true said meacham �he said to me in that interview last year that he felt the civil war could�ve been over with� said meacham �there was a deal to have been struck� so meacham said he thinks trump�s love of the mythology of andrew jackson collided with his own confidence of himself as a deal maker that he blurted out the comment that jackson �could have stopped the civil war� otis sanford talks memphis racial politics otis sanford a longtime columnist for the commercial appeal was at the overby center on april  to talk about the racial conflict and transition that has taken place in memphis politics from the time of eh crump�s rule of the city in the first half of the th century to the modern era where africanamericans exert power sanford has written about the subject in his new book �from boss crump to king willie how race changed memphis politics� mississippis free state of jones a rebellion against the confederacy by poor white farmers in jones county loyal to the union joined by a few former slaves led to the establishment of the �free state of jones� during the civil war these series of events were the focus of a discussion on april  by two prominent jones county natives retired us district judge charles pickering and jones county junior college history instructor and leading authority on the insurgency wyatt moulds and charles overby chairman of the host overby center for southern journalism and politics at ole miss the uprising in jones county has been the subject of several books and was dramatized last year in a movie �the free state of jones� starring matthew mcconaughey in the role of newton knight the leader of a guerrilla operation that succeeded in seizing control of part of the county the breakaway movement eventually failed but with the defeat of the confederacy and the implementation of reconstruction in the south knight continued to led an interracial struggle in the southeast mississippi county moulds has been a member of the faculty at jones county junior college in ellisville since  served as an advisor to gary ross the director of the film and is considered a leading authority on the subject of knight�s insurgency mississippians say the strangest things david crews the chief clerk for the us district courts in north mississippi was at the overby center on march  to talk about his collection of intriguing � and sometimes odd � quotes from mississippians crews an oxford resident and a bona fide renaissance man enjoys a statewide reputation as a raconteur and an authority on many things mississippi crews began his talk by referencing the programme header thats not really accurate he said the title should be mississippians say the most insightful heartfelt treacherous wicked humorous absurd poignant powerful and strange things my book is an attempt through powerful words lyrics insights and stories to more fully explore and understand mississippi �david collects quotes the way some guys collect baseball cards� said overby �mississippians are great at talking and david has put together comments that are inspiring outrageous and funny the stories he tells behind the quotes are fascinating� over the years crews saved quotes from politicians and writers as well as musicians and athletes the book contains  categories of over  quotes from more than  hundred different mississippians there are two lines that sum up why i put this book together said crews the first is from ms eudora welty who wrote one place understood helps us understand all places better and mississippi i think is worth struggling to understand sometimes it is a struggle and without a doubt i think this collection helps us better understand mississippi from the perspective of our best writers musicians playwrights artists storytellers and others he said the second quote comes from beth henleys play crimes of the heart its a human need to talk about our lives its an important human need and without a doubt mississippians love to talk crews said to weave stories to write to sing it is in our dna revisiting jefferson davis and j z george us capitol relics should mississippi still be represented in the us capitol�s national statuary hall by two th century figures who were prominent in the secessionist movement or is it time for the state to honor more modern th century leaders overby center chairman charles overby william �brother� rogers president of the mississippi historical society and marvin king associate professor of political science and african american studies at the university of mississippi came together to discuss the matter each state is allowed to select two people to be honored with statues in the us capitol eightysix years ago the mississippi legislature chose davis the president of the confederacy and george who signed the ordinance of secession after the civil war george became chief justice of the mississippi supreme court before serving  years in the us senate �there is no question that davis and george were political leaders from mississippi in the th century� overby said �the question is whether there are th century mississippians equally or more deserving to represent mississippi today mississippi has an impressive list of accomplished th century citizens worthy of consideration they range from senator john stennis to authors william faulkner and eudora welty to civil rights leader medgar evers along with many others� the assault on the media  four prominent veteran mississippi journalists discussed the growing hostility to the press in a panel discussion here at the overby center the program is set in a time when news media credibility seems to be at a low ebb nationally meanwhile mississippi journalists trying to report on state government are increasingly meeting strong resistance from more secretive elected officials the panel included veteran clarionledger investigative reporter jerry mitchell whose work helped send several former ku klux klansmen to prison marshall ramsey the clarionledger cartoonist ronnie agnew executive director of mississippi public broadcasting and kate royals the awardwinning education reporter for mississippi today overby fellow bill rose served as moderator journalism is about truth and we will never ever give up that right said agnew you have to be persistent and willing to do what it takes said mitchell how deep is
