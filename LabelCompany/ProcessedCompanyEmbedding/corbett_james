crosstown rivals since corbett and jackson were boxing instructors at san franciscos two most prestigious athletic clubs they fought to a nocontest after  rounds the fight vaulted corbett to even greater national prominence and the public clamored for a contest between sullivan and him the champion reluctantly agreed and the fight was finally set corbett went into rigorous training and was even more confident of his chances after he sparred with sullivan in a short exhibition match on a san francisco stage on september   at the olympic club in new orleans louisiana corbett won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out john l sullivan in the st round corbetts new scientific boxing technique enabled him to dodge sullivans rushing attacks and wear him down with jabs corbett did not prove to be a fighting champion in todays terms meaning he defended the title very rarely what must be remembered is this was an era before boxing commissions and the regulation of the sport was minimal at best boxing was outlawed in most states so arranging a time and place for a bout was largely a hitandmiss proposition corbett treasured his title and viewed it as the ultimate promotional

championship to the cornish british boxer bob fitzsimmons in carson city nevada corbett was dominant for most of the fight and knocked fitzsimmons to the canvas in the sixth round fitzsimmons recovered and though badly cut rallied from that point on when mrs fitzsimmons called out hit him in the slats bob where slats meant the abdominal area her husband followed her advice the body blows took their toll and though corbett continued to outbox his opponent masterfully ringsiders could see the champion slowing down fitzsimmons put corbett down in the th round with a withering body blow to the solar plexus and corbett despite his best efforts to do so could not regain his feet by the end of the tencount this fight lasting over an hour and a half was released to cinemas later that year as the corbettfitzsimmons fight the longest film ever released at the time devastated by the loss of his title corbett did everything he could to lure fitzsimmons back into the ring he was sure fitzsimmonss victory had been a fluke mostly attributed to his overtraining which left him short on stamina in the later rounds and was confident he would win the rematch perhaps fitzsimmons felt the same way for not even a  guaranteed purse posted by corbetts manager william a brady could get ruby robert back into the ring with gentleman jim it may also have been fitzsimmons intense personal dislike of corbett who had often publicly insulted him which ruled out any chance of another fight corbett training for his fight with jeffries this set the stage for what most boxing experts and ring historians consider to be corbetts finest fight refusing to face corbett ruby robert chose the hulking james j jeffries a former sparring partner of corbetts and a big heavyweight even by modern standards for his title defense fitzsimmons did some damage in the early rounds but jeffries weathered the storm and took the title in the th round jeffries had learned much of his trade training with corbett and was now handled by corbetts old manager william brady corbett who had been put on the back burner during fitzsimmons reign wasted no time in suggesting a title fight between his old sparring partner and himself brady liking corbett and reflecting after a recent poor showing against tom sharkey that his old fighter had little left in the tank at  agreed to the match the fight was set for the seaside arena in coney island new york while jeffries went through the motions in training corbett prepared like a spartan for battle he knew with his speed he could box rings around his larger and stronger opponent but he was giving up size strength almost  lb in weight and a sevenyear age difference the key was stamina and the ability to last the round fight limit the early rounds saw corbett moving quickly while big jeff attempted body shots however jeffries could not lay a glove on the dancing master round after round corbett had his way darting in to land punches then dancing away to avoid retaliation by the th round jeffries corner was in a panic manager brady dismissed trainer tommy ryan from the corner and took charge himself with the simple but direct order knock him out or lose your title corbett only had to stay upright for the last five rounds to be heavyweight champion once again jeffries stalked corbett around the ring looking for an opening corbett danced away from any threat through the nd round midway through the rd round corbett leaned back to avoid a jeffries blow bounced off the ropes and was put on the canvas by a short right hand he was counted out corbett found himself embraced by the public after this gallant effort the adoration was shortlived as his next fight a fiveround knockout over kid mccoy was widely believed to be a fix

acting performing at a variety of theatres he has been called the father of modern boxing for his scientific approach and innovations in techniquecitation needed  corbett vs jackson on may   corbett fought peter black prince jackson a muchheralded bout between crosstown rivals since corbett and jackson were boxing instructors at san franciscos two most prestigious athletic clubs they fought to a nocontest after  rounds the fight vaulted corbett to even greater national prominence and the public clamored for a contest between sullivan and him the champion reluctantly agreed and the fight was finally set corbett went into rigorous training and was even more confident of his chances after he sparred with sullivan in a short exhibition match on a san francisco stage on september   at the olympic club in new orleans louisiana corbett won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out john l sullivan in the st round corbetts new scientific boxing technique enabled him to dodge sullivans rushing attacks and wear him down with jabs corbett did not prove to be a fighting champion in todays terms meaning he defended the title very rarely what must be remembered is this was an era before boxing commissions and the regulation of the sport was minimal at best boxing was outlawed in most states so arranging a time and place for a bout was largely a hitandmiss proposition corbett treasured his title and viewed it as the ultimate promotional tool for his two main sources of income theatrical performances and boxing exhibitions play media the  boxing match vs peter courtney the  boxing match vs fitzsimmons in his only successful title defense on january   corbett knocked out charley mitchell of great britain in three rounds on september   he took part in the production of one of the first recorded boxing events a fight with peter courtney this was filmed at the black maria studio at west orange new jersey and was produced by william kl dickson it was only the second boxing match to be recorded jim corbett lost his heavyweight championship to the cornish british boxer bob fitzsimmons in carson city nevada corbett was dominant for most of the fight and knocked fitzsimmons to the canvas in the sixth round fitzsimmons recovered and though badly cut rallied from that point on when mrs fitzsimmons called out hit him in the slats bob where slats meant the abdominal area her husband followed her advice the body blows took their toll and though corbett continued to outbox his opponent masterfully ringsiders could see the champion slowing down fitzsimmons put corbett down in the th round with a withering body blow to the solar plexus and corbett despite his best efforts to do so could not regain his feet by the end of the tencount this fight lasting over an hour and a half was released to cinemas later that year as the corbettfitzsimmons fight the longest film ever released at the time devastated by the loss of his title corbett did everything he could to lure fitzsimmons back into the ring he was sure fitzsimmonss victory had been a fluke mostly attributed to his overtraining which left him short on stamina in the later rounds and was confident he would win the rematch perhaps fitzsimmons felt the same way for not even a  guaranteed purse posted by corbetts manager william a brady could get ruby robert back into the ring with gentleman jim it may also have been fitzsimmons intense personal dislike of corbett who had often publicly insulted him which ruled out any chance of another fight corbett training for his fight with jeffries this set the stage for what most boxing experts and ring historians consider to be corbetts finest fight refusing to face corbett ruby robert chose the hulking james j jeffries a former sparring partner of corbetts and a big heavyweight even by modern standards for his title defense fitzsimmons did some damage in the early rounds but jeffries weathered the storm and took the title in the th round jeffries had learned much of his trade training with corbett and was now handled by corbetts old manager william brady corbett who had been put on the back burner during fitzsimmons reign wasted no time in suggesting a title fight between his old sparring partner and himself brady liking corbett and reflecting after a recent poor showing against tom sharkey that his old fighter had little left in the tank at  agreed to the match the fight was set for the seaside arena in coney island new york while jeffries went through the motions in training corbett prepared like a spartan for battle he knew with his speed he could box rings around his larger and stronger opponent but he was giving up size strength almost  lb in weight and a sevenyear age difference the key was stamina and the ability to last the round fight limit the early rounds saw corbett moving quickly while big jeff attempted body shots however jeffries could not lay a glove on the dancing master round after round corbett had his way darting in to land punches then dancing away to avoid retaliation by the th round jeffries corner was in a panic manager brady dismissed trainer tommy ryan from the corner and took charge himself with the simple but direct order knock him out or lose your title corbett only had to stay upright for the last five rounds to be heavyweight champion once again jeffries stalked corbett around the ring looking for an opening corbett danced away from any threat through the nd round midway through the rd round corbett leaned back to avoid a jeffries blow bounced off the ropes and was put on the canvas by a short right hand he was counted out corbett found himself embraced by the public after this gallant effort the adoration was shortlived as his next fight a fiveround knockout over kid mccoy was widely believed to be a fix corbett managed to contest for the heavyweight title one last time when he met jeffries for a second match in san francisco in  now  reflexes
