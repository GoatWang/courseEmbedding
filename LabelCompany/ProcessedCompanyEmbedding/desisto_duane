duane m desisto thanks brian good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us our second quarter results highlighted by record levels of revenue and gross margin demonstrates the strong progress we continue to make across all aspects of the business for the second quarter we reported consolidated revenue of  million representing  growth over the same period last year demand for the new omnipod remains high as evidenced by  omnipod revenue growth yearoveryear as our easily used water proof tubeless design continues to appeal to customers especially in key demographics such as children over  of our new patient starts this year are children under the age of  with nearly  of them aged  and under just as an point the omnipod continues to make positive strides with healthcare professionals since launch in february  nearly  of prescribing physicians are new to the omnipod with over  now ep prescribers in addition to this sweet side to the pod hcp has continued to cite the updated insulin onboard calculator the simplicity of the system is readytowear without assembly and lifestyle connivance is key reasons why they prescribe the product and they say that these features are especially – prescribing the omnipod to people who have not previously used an insulin pump approximately  of our patience starts continued to be people who are new to insulin pumping when these people are asked why they choose the omnipod the answer is simple better glucose control without sacrificing freedom ensuring the way we can meet the service needs of both our customers and our prescribing healthcare professionals is critical to our longterm growth as soon as completing the process to transition our patient base in the new omnipod last fall we have worked tirelessly to rebuild confidence in our customer service functions they came under pressure from the demand at the launch i’m incredibly pleased to note that we have returned our satisfaction levels to those who see increased transition today over  of our patients will refer the omnipod to a friend and  out of  patients consider themselves satisfied very satisfied with the omnipod as a whole to ensure we are meeting the increased demands for larger prescriber base we embarked earlier this year to expand the commercial field sales team from approximately  to  people to do this we established a new role the key account manager who would join existing territories and be tasked with ensuring the high level customer service to critical existing accounts our initial new resources were hired by april trained in the field by early may the remaining product class has been in the field since june  with these new reps in place we’re about half of the second quarter we’re very pleased with their early success territories with the key account manager have generated a  increase from referrals as compared to a standard territory we’re seeing even better results in the beginning of the third quarter with referrals outpacing our second quarter results with referrals increasing and productivity improving we enter third quarter with our largest customer pipelines since the launch of the new omnipod that said new patient starts which have increased by approximately  yearoveryear were impacted in the second quarter by a unilateral change made by a significant managed care plans as their reimbursement polices so i think unexpected reimbursement cost due to code usage by type  products and lower priced cost alternatives the managed care provider stop the only patient shipments and existing customer reorders to reestablish medical necessity for patients this managed care plan typically accounts for approximately  of our new patient starts in the given period and to service through a distributor partner as we do not hold this direct contact with the provider once we become aware the problem our commercial team assisted our distribution partner in resolving the issue for existing patient reorders we continue to work with our distributor and the managed care provider on finding the appropriate solution for new patients we are currently backlog in new patient starts until the issue resolved i am confident that we will resolve this issue in the next few months we impacted the business from this issue was approximately  million revenue in the second quarter and will likely continue to affect the third quarter as well in total we anticipate this issue to result and up to a  million reduction in  revenue our international business with ypsomed and glaxosmithkline have another strong quarter and remains on pace the double revenue yearoveryear ypsomed continues to takes you in key markets such as germany the netherlands and switzerland and just recently officially launched in italy as well turning to our manufacturing operations from the third straight quarter we manufactured approximately  million omnipods providing the level of stability and predictability we haven’t had in our history at a consistent level of  omnipods per day we have been able to improve quality reduce scrap costs resulting in an expanding gross margins i am very pleased that we achieved two significant milestones in second quarter as our us omnipod margins increased to over  and our consolidated gross margin reached  while on a consolidated basis gross margin is continue to be impacted slightly by pricing the product mix within our neighborhood subsidiary we are confident that we will see continued gross margin expansion of approximately  to  basis points per quarter for the remainder of  although proud of our progress with the new omnipod i am very excited about the many products that we have in the – our pipeline we expect that these products will keep insulin at the forefront of innovation for years to come let me provide you with some updates starting with the exciting news we announced earlier this week we are very pleased that we have been able to rekindle our development partnership with dexcom over the last couple of months we have announced two collaborations which we believe will provide a combined patients with easier access to the data they need to more efficiently manage the diabetes the first announcement in june at the american diabetes association conference in san francisco is the integration of certain omnipod data into dexcom’s first of its kind mobile application the second collaboration announced on tuesday at the american association of diabetes educators conference in orlando is the integration of dexcom glucose data into a new bluetooth enabled pdm which is currently under development our goal with this project is to be able to develop software to similar to what dexcom has under development which we’ll be able to be displayed on our pdm for both projects we will each be responsible for our own development cost with much of dexcom’s investment focused on their new mobile application and most of our investment focused on the integration from new pdm we feel strongly the time is right for these collaborations to move forward while we are very excited to be partnering with dexcom again do continue forward with our own cgm enabled omnipod project with a separate partner as well as i mentioned last quarter we have made significant progress over the past couple of quarters with the completion of an insertion study as well as resolving our sterilization challenges over the back half of the year we will be working on prototype development and additional testing to compare for human trials in early  we also continue to partner with lifescan on the integration of the variable plug glucose meter platform into the pdm in may we received initial questions back from the fda but most of the questions are on additional testing to be completed at this point the extra testing has been finished the report has been compiled we anticipate responding back to the fda by quarter end with hope for an approval in the fourth quarter we’re also making great progress on our u product and planning to ship with eli lilly and complete their first round of human practice testing this past quarter and expect to start a second round in the coming weeks we still anticipate to file the k submission of our product to the fda by the end of the year the number of people living with type  diabetes in the us is staggering and these increases each and every day new cost effective treatments need to be introduced to help combat this growing epidemic we continue to receive positive feedback from many healthcare professional by this collaborative offering the omnipod has the potential to be an effective easy to use alternative from improved compliance improved ac benefits for these highly insulin resistant patients we also remain enthusiastic about several opportunities in noninsulin drug delivery space we believe the opportunity in the drug delivery space is important our amgen partnership has a chance to be game changer when we look forward to the approval of the product by the fda with both ferring and amgen products in the commercial phase we’ve proven that our omnipod is the solution for subcutaneous drug delivery outside of these relationships we have a number of other initiatives in the development phase we look forward to discussing additional opportunities in the future finally let me mention a couple of additional items to note in the quarter first we entered into a settlement and license agreement with becton dickinson and company to resolve the outstanding patent litigation given the uncertainty distraction and continued expense that come with the jury trial we determined that this was an appropriate time to reach a settlement as such in june we agreed to a  million onetime payment has taken its charge of approximately  million in the pl to account from the settlement and the associated legal fees incurred we also took advantage of the financial markets in the second quarter and refinanced our convertible debt through this refinancing which brian will discuss some more detail we are able to extent the maturity by  years to june of  reduce our cashes risk rate nearly in half to  and increased the conversion price by over   million per share and with that i will turn the call over to brian brian k roberts thank you duane consolidated revenue increased by  yearoveryear to  million for the quarter ended june   form  million in the same period last year omnipod revenue grew by more than  in the second quarter of last year consolidated revenue for the first six months of this year was  million compared to  million from the first six months of  an increase of approximately  yearoveryear gross profit increased by  in the second quarter to  million as compared to gross profit of  million in the second quarter of  as duane noted we achieved record gross margins in the second quarter as our us omnipod gross margin eclipsed  for our consolidated gross margin of  represents a  basis point increase over the second quarter of  since the transition for the new omnipod commenced in the first quarter of last year we’ve gained nearly  basis points in gross margin the increase in margin is a direct result of continued reductions in the overall cost to produce each omnipod based on the lower bill of materials higher manufacturing volumes and reduced scrap charges we continue to expect to add approximately  basis points to  basis points of gross margin in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year as we take further advantage of the efficiencies gained from the new omnipod gross profit for the first six months of  was  million an increase of  million or  as compared to  million in the first six months of  operating expenses increased by  million or  yearoveryear to  million in the second quarter from  million in the prior year this increase is primarily a result of approximately  million in settlement and legal costs related to the patent litigation with becton dickinson and company sequentially operating expenses increased by  million from the first quarter of  again due to the lawsuit settlement we expect the operating expenses in the range of  million to  million per quarter for q and q reflecting the investments into the sales and marketing functions operating expense were  million for the first six months compared to  million for the first six months of  operating loss was  million compared to  million in the prior year excluding the onetime settlement charges we would have generated an operating profit of approximately  million in the second quarter an improvement of approximately  million over the second quarter of last year we expect to be operating profitable going forward interest and other expense was  million in the second quarter compared to  million last year in june we issued approximately  million of  convertible senior notes maturing in june  and used  million of the net proceeds to repurchase the  million of the outstanding  notes due june  in connection with the repurchase we recorded a onetime loss from the extinguishment of debt of  million we also called the remaining  million of outstanding  notes for redemption in june these notes were extinguished just last week in exchange for  million in cash and approximately  shares of common stock net interest and other expense was  million for the first six months compared to  million for the first six months of last year going forward we expect to record total interest expense each quarter of  million comprised of  million in cash interest expense and  million in noncash interest expense our net loss for the second quarter of  was  million or  per share as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the second quarter of last year excluding the impact of the patent settlement and the extinguishment of the  convertible notes our net loss would have been approximately  million or approximately  per share representing a  improvement over the second quarter of  net loss for the first six months was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share for the first six months of last year our cash and cash equivalents balance was  million at june  compared to  million at december  as of june  we had approximately  million common shares outstanding finally as duane noted we remain confident in the business and are pleased with our first half results gross margin continue to expand and our manufacturing operations continue to excel the investments in the commercial team should produce a return in the second half of the year and our international business remains on pace to double in  with the patent lawsuit settled and the convertible debt refinancing complete we are poised to show operating profit going forward that said taking into consideration the payor issue which impacted the second quarter and our expectation that it will likely continue to affect the back half of the year we have adjusted our  revenue expectations to  million to  million this change represents a  reduction in revenue at the midpoint for the third quarter we expect revenue of  million to  million and with that let me turn the call back over to duane duane m desisto thanks brian in summary we’re pleased with our second quarter results despite recent payor challenge which i’m confident we will resolve we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth of  in the omnipod business and  overall we are well positioned for continued robust growth as the addition of  new commercial team members make a positive impact throughout the back half of the year our pipeline is strong our gross continuing increase monthovermonth and the team is excited and engaged our manufacturing operations continue to show the levels of stability and consistency never before by insulet and we remain on track to passing the form of fourth manufacturing line in the next few months we continue to be an innovative leader in this space with several exciting initiatives in – and i’m pleased to see new opportunities going forward i’m confident and excited about the strong second half of  with that operator please open the phones for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from danielle antalffy with leerink partners your line is open danielle j antalffy – leerink partners llc good afternoon guys thanks for taking the questions duane m desisto hi danielle danielle j antalffy – leerink partners llc just was a followup on the payor issue number one what gives you guys confidence that you will resolve this issue and then a followup to that what the risk of the business there is other payors follow suite or do you think that we have possibility duane m desisto it’s a great question daniel so a we are confident because as soon as – the thing that makes us a little different – just certainly when im called clear is all these projects all these payor contracts come up for renewal so this is an ongoing issue we’ll make this a little different it was and we are in the middle of negotiating with the distributor and the payor all three of us together here so i don’t want to go too far obviously because we’re working our way through it but this was a little bit of a kneejerk reaction what the payors are going through some of the various codes in categories and so they just shut them all down which that the equipment people at risk it’s the big deal so as soon as we are made aware of it we got involved we got the reorder business turn back on the payor has already offered up a potential solution in terms of how to handle this on a go forward basis we are not exactly thrilled with it – once again i don’t want to throw the details on what the solution is sufficed to say it makes the process more complicated it’s not a price of action at the moment it’s none of that just makes the price more complicated but it does appear that things were going through the category most notably the stuff that will kind of affect the type  patients that they were not happy about and so as we saw they dug in their first solutions at the door so having said that could it happen again yeah this is a little bit of a really harsh reaction obviously there is – there is not a year that it goes by we are not – so this was a little bit unusual took us by surprise because we really want to first contacted we kind of noticed distributors business being an impact that we start to point them on to it they started thinking as so it took us a little while to get to the bottom of what was happening but our customers gave us the heads up when we started driving that process so a little bit up in the one and i will gets that – what is clear is insulin pumping that affair kind of anything else that’s out there for type  diabetes patients and this continues to be more studies proving that so i don’t think that’s going to be a longterm issue but suffice to say this is what it is we don’t have a resolve today that’s why we are temporally we have guidance on the back half until we get it resolved hopefully we will get on the call the next quarter if we got it all resolve we can give you a little clearer view of it but it is resolvable it’s just legacy that were in the middle of it side i don’t want to get too far in detail with as the terms of what’s going on danielle j antalffy – leerink partners llc okay that’s helpful and then just wanted to get your thoughts on that the partnership with dexcom happy to see that – how are you trying to think about that from a growth perspective is that a big driver for new patient adds or is that just sort of incremental so how big of a deal should we be thinking about that from a top line growth perspective duane m desisto okay i think – i didn’t have the opportunity to listen in on dexcom’s call yesterday but i think it’s – i think it’s going to help it will continue to help both companies in the long term i think the real thing is when we start trying to figure out how it’s going to be dialed in really it comes around the timing here and we’re working out those details it’s with dexcom’s gen sensors so that really is kind of the drivers in terms of when it’s going to impact the business danielle j antalffy – leerink partners llc all right thanks so much guys duane m desisto thanks operator our next question comes from william plovanic of canaccord genuity your line is open william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc great thank you good evening can you hear me duane m desisto hey bill brian k roberts hey bill william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc so just clarity so the reorder has been cleared up so the utilization reorder rate should not be impacted going forward correct duane m desisto that’s correct william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc and then so it’s only on the new patients and then would that also affect your ndi business duane m desisto what do you mean our ndi segment the neighborhood business william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc yes duane m desisto these aren’t patients that go through the neighborhood with those separate managed care the managed care payor that goes through our third party distributor but it’s not neighborhood william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc okay okay and then just – if i look at inventories in the quarter they’re extremely low or very low are there any manufacturing issues or concerns or – i mean it tells us demand is high but your inventory is burned down a little i’m just curious on your thoughts on that duane m desisto i think bill it’s a great question i think from our standpoint what you don’t see there is all the stuff that’s in china moving forward but having said that the inventory levels where want to no i think q you’ll see an incremental up tick in the inventory number and hopefully by q we’ll be kind of closer to where we want to be william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc okay and then you have a – was it a fourth line it’s up incoming is that still on track or where are you with it duane m desisto yes fourth line is on track and it should be producing product for us before year end william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc okay so that’s what will help your resolve it in the fourth quarter duane m desisto yeah i mean we continue to make really good progress i mean obviously just the level of consistency that we’ve had in production going back the last nine months now has been i think unique to our business over the last six years at least where that’s been around which is great the operations team is doing a fantastic job i think we’ve seen a little bit of an uptick here in the third quarter in production from them and we should be hopefully near two and three quarters the  million pause in the third quarter of this year and then you are growing even beyond that hopefully in q with the addition of line for then producing as well so but production is going very well william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc okay and then last question if i may just if you strip out the  million the  million in charges your ga would have been a level we haven’t seem since  on an absolute nominal basis is that the right number to go off of i mean you are spending that much on litigation so that’s kind of our new core base rate or how do we think about that and that’s all i have thank you duane m desisto yeah sure bill i think that’s right i mean again in total we are talking about  million to  million of operating expenses per quarter for q and q q is really the first full quarter where we have incurred all of the charges related to the sales and marketing hires that we did but on the ga line yeah i think that’s accurate we certainly have worked our way over the course of the last  months through the medtronic litigation last fall but that in the litigation the couple of these other item and that’s hopefully all behind us at this point william j plovanic – canaccord genuity inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from raj denhoy of jefferies your line is open raj denhoy – jefferies  company inc wonder if i could ask one about the managed care situation as well i think daniel asked this why don’t you answer it but just in terms of the what gives you the confidence that you wanted this in other payors as well duane m desisto raj i guess where we are at we didn’t add this with our products in the market since  this the first time we’ve seen anything like that and part of this i think will makes it a little unusual is we go through about three distributors in the us that has this one big healthcare contract and so this is one of the few that we don’t have the seat on the table – seat at the table and like i said so i think will makes this a little unusual we were hearing from our customers we had again engage with the distributor distributor again engage with the managed care so i think all the other stock i mean we have good relationships with these manage care providers if there’s changes in coverage or anything going on we are usually involved in the discussion so i think that’s makes this a little bit of a kind of one off it’s a major provider so it made it problematic but like i said i think everywhere else we don’t think the relationship could extend people are thinking about changes in policy these ongoing discussions you can kind of anticipate it you can understand where they’re coming from and there is give and take this was – by the time we’re going to engage this it’s just going to shut down the whole kind of insulin pump category general and that was their solution and this time they’re turning back on so a little different i’m not saying it would have been different if we had a direct contact we had a direct contract with this customer but i would tell you this is way out of the norm for what we typically say brian k roberts yeah raj this is brian i just had a couple of things one is it’s been well known really over the last year or so since medtronic launched g that there were plant that we’re – you’re not wanting to reimburse for that product and we’re holding it back and your debt has been well documented our understanding is that this provider it impacted not just insulet it impacted others as well i think that would be one of the ones that was impacted was the g so it’s not unique but as duane pointed out it is a little unique – in this one as we don’t hold the direct relationship and so it just took us a little bit longer i think to be able to get involved in it hopefully at the end of just some noise – and we’ll work our way through it over the next couple of months and we’ll just be done with it raj denhoy – jefferies  company inc okay just one more question on that as well i think you described it as being related to type  diabetics perhaps being reimbursed i think and i don’t even get a lot of detail with what i understood with that perhaps type  diabetics for getting reimbursed for these pumps is that correct and that’s what figures this duane m desisto so one of the – brian described kind of little bit on the higher end higherpriced pumps one of the other things that we’re looking at is why we’re type  patients the insulin dependent type  patients being reimbursed for our pump so that once again keep in mind russ i think you got pretty respective we’re kind of the third man in on this so this is – and obviously we’ll step in the driver’s seat if it doesn’t get resolved the right way but we heard that that was another piece of what they reacted to they couldn’t understand why type  patients given that there are other low cost solutions for insulin dependent type s they were not happy with the fact that some type  patients will be reimbursed duane m desisto to be clear they are not our patients raj denhoy – jefferies  company inc yeah duane m desisto these weren’t our charges going through these were other companies using codes mainly for getting type  reimbursement that the plans i guess were surprised by raj denhoy – jefferies  company inc okay that’s helpful and may be just i’ll ask one about the drug delivery business that you commented on it’s still waiting for the fda approval on the amgen pump but do you have any updates on that in terms of when we might expect that product and i think a level of enthusiasm might have ticked up a little bit too but maybe you could update us on your expectations where we can expect like its approved duane m desisto yeah i mean for us it’s unchanged and we’ve been in constant dialog with the amgen folks i think they are working through their process i don’t want to talk on their behalf but overall i think we are all feeling pretty confident that the timelines we’ve laid out are still holding true so i think overall everything were seem to be hearing as positive and we are moving forward as planned raj denhoy – jefferies  company inc okay helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tom gunderson of piper jaffray your line is open tom gunderson – piper jaffray  co hi guys let’s talk about the payor problem the so far what i understood… duane m desisto you don’t want to talk about the  growth or the  yearoveryear tom gunderson – piper jaffray  co well and it really gets down to that because if this is just a speed bump for a company that’s growing its main product by  than – we are just going to work on through it but what we need to do is just understand all the details of it to see that this really is a speed bump so from next level of detail that i am looking at based on what you are saying to raj earlier is it affects all pumps you have the distributor’s contract as far as omnipod goes right is that what i am hearing duane m desisto it’s a distributed contract i am not sure it affects all pumps i want to be cautious about that it doesn’t take other pumps tom gunderson – piper jaffray  co but to correct this do you need to correct it for all the pumps that are involved by this or can you focus and get this taken care just for you so that you’re dealing in the things that you can control duane m desisto yeah i know we are dealing in the parts that we can control the benefits we have is obviously we have a separate coding structure then the all the other guys primarily all the other guys right although there is thus seen to little bit due to activity on our course by others which probably caused a little bit of their inks and was unexpected so we can work through our codes in our parts and ultimately you’ll figure out frankly how do we just get them a little bit more comfortable that the patients that are being pushed through our distributor partner are the right patients to be going on the problem as duane pointed out i think one of the questions they are holding is really just around medical necessity and i think within the type  community medical necessity is pretty well documented so we just have to make sure we’re clear with people and clear with the specific provider i think of who these folks are why they need the product and what do they need to be able to make those approvals in a more timely manner brian k roberts and that’s the part that’s a little bit of a head scratcher is dcct has been around for over  years and there is medical necessity that’s virtually irrefutable for type s and i am just wondering that are you running across did you get kind of thrown out with the bath water kind of thing here or is there somebody who’s got their number next up or – trying to get – what it takes to correct duane m desisto so i think brian adequately described kind of what it takes to correct i think the situation as you described it there is some higher price products coming into the market that seems to be slippening to various codes tom gunderson – piper jaffray  co got it duane m desisto there seems to be some kind of lower end type  products that it – once again we are not at the table at the moment but from where were be in total there’s some lower end type  products that try to kind of slipping under some of our codes so the type  in the higher end products both i think sent this provider the sale case of solution is we shut the door and then we’ll get everybody to come to us as opposed to asking the question it’s kind of seems to be the efforts they took one would be my preferential approach but it does seems to be the – so like i said getting the reimbursement it caused us a few weeks here in the quarter for getting the – getting the reorder stuff turned back on which is pretty straight forward process and we think once some of the stuff gets cleared up here we’d be able to get this turned back on like i said the only thing that was kind of really unusual for us is because we did not see it on the table we started getting customer calls which led us to call our distributor partner which led down to call the managed care provider and which is based on the way i described the batched took up that’s a good time in the quarter and we’re working as fast as we can to straighten this other thing up tom gunderson – piper jaffray  co okay i got it thanks for the extra details good job on the  duane m desisto thank you brian k roberts thank you tom operator thank you our next question comes from ben andrew of william blair your line is open benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay guys thanks for taking the questions i think you’ve said there is about  million of impact on the full year is that roughly split q q residual after the  duane m desisto yeah i think i think it’s kind of pretty much all exclusive ben and i think what we said is it could be up to a million we are hoping today the guidance we’re giving obviously reflects that relatively get this cleaned up year end and hopefully next quarter we can come back in tweet it one more time brian k roberts yeah i mean to add to that i mean basically obviously these new patient starts you delay new patient starts delay the timing of when the reorders commit so impacting q about patient starts delay the timing when the reorders comes through in that’s the impact to compound little bit so impact q is about  million impacting q is probably above  million if you look at it and then q could represent the other the other five or so kind of the worst case scenario if we really wanted – up to the whole  million so hopefully we’re able to do solve it in time to – the first sem of that q hit obviously new patients that don’t start later we can’t get that timing back but we can effect it to the others going forward benjamin andrew – william blair  company sure and i guess – maybe hard to know but if you loose some of these new patients starts you’re losing for good to maybe one of those other pumps that weren’t impacted or can you tell duane m desisto i think it’s – at the moment i think it’s tough to tell we know who these patients are now so we’ve opened up a dialog with them we’ll keep them in the loop and we’re trying to keep them as warm as you can keep them right and i think if it goes on a couple of more weeks i think we feel good if it goes on eight more weeks obviously some people may lose a little bit more interest i think the one thing i think the one thing that we have going for us is it’s a pretty that people have chosen this product they chose it for the obvious reasons and so the goal is something out may not be what we do worry about is they say what let me just keep taking my shots and may be i will go back and make this we did this at end of the year rightly four months without – right before i might did that was reset so that’s the kind of thing we are concerned about they – they can’t just say don’t needed now i look at it i look at it late in the year right before my insurance plan reset and i will be able to defend so i am not sure we loosing to another pump but we may just lose some back that comes benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay and can you give us a little more granularity on when in the quarter you became aware of this and when you kind of started to be able – try to be alert duane m desisto you know i mean what’s seems to be clear to begin part of the way we figure this out as you seeing ordering pattern from a distributor so it looks like it happens really in the beginning part of may but i would say we really didn’t become aware of it until the earlier part of june right so kind of really second week or so in june benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay and just two housekeeping things did you said gross margins  to  bips per quarter is that corporate or omnipad duane m desisto consolidated i mean there is a wind up being both because the omnipad side is certainly driving but on a consolidated basis between  bips and  bips per quarter benjamin andrew – william blair  company sure any change in product pricing or utilization for patient separate as issue in the quarter duane m desisto no not really podd price continues to kind of hang in very much of  to  range for its been for the last probably quarters utilization teams within the exception of this group of patient to clearly got delayed out of few weeks seems pretty normal benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay and you got  million in cash just turned operating profitable and sustainably well what do you see doing with that obviously that’s a fair chunk of cash to have sitting around duane m desisto yeah subsequent to june  we effectively used about  million of that cash right  million to retire effectively the last part of those  notes that happened on july  and the  million backed in payment happened with the first week or so of july so the number bounces back to about  million which is really where we kind of begin the year and yeah we’ve got a bunch of initiatives and things on the plate i mean i put this in the good problem to have categories so i think we’re – we’ll kind of see how the business continues to evolve and develop and i think you have still debt outstanding and we’ll kind of continue to monitor or manage against those things benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay and then last from me any update on when we might see some human data on your cgm partner duane m desisto well where full systems go still we’re trying to get ready for human trial here in the beginning part of  so that’s a reasonable timeline to think but if some of the data will go onside that trail benjamin andrew – william blair  company okay great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from jayson bedford of raymond james your line is open michael rich – raymond james  associates inc michael rich calling in for jayson can you hear me okay duane m desisto all right michael rich – raymond james  associates inc thanks for taking the questions i’m not going to ask you about the payor dynamics yet duane m desisto you can ask me about the  growth michael rich – raymond james  associates inc well i was going to ask you about the expanded agreement with dexcom it sounds like it’s somewhat depending on their gen timeline but when are you expecting to file approval for nextgen pdm i know you were saying you’d have it displayed at ada next year but when do you think you file that and does that become a pma because it will be able to display cgm data or does a cell phone create redundancy that’s huge in your k duane m desisto yeah so obviously we are going to take that to the fda to your second question i think from our standpoint and talking with dexcom guys they are at its pma but our argument would be quite simply that one is going to display that app on the cell phone which is obviously not a fda regulated device there seems to be our guess in our logic no reason why our help when we remain k so and i think from my standpoint i think we’ve spent some time we talk to lot of people at the agency as you can imagine this all these apps and everything went on the fda has the people at ebitda with listening into all from all the stuff unfortunately because we have the scholars and fda and ebitda i am sure if there was going to be anything be in this place there the dfa will have people there so i think it’s changing fast and furious i think they’re trying to embrace the new technology so i think we feel good that we got a very strong argument that why would the handheld be a pma and if the handheld does turn out that it has to be a pma it’s not really the end of world for us it only becomes a big problem for us if the pod were to being pma and that’s when we talk about integrating sensing technology into a pod that’s why when that time comes we could have it too perfect but – so – like i said our belief is we think it may be a k because if you can display it on a cell phone then our next generation product is not all that different from now so that’s kind of how we’re looking at it and then – so i think to your first question i think the big update for us and i think we’ll have a very good handle at this the ada next june in boston it’s kind of going to be where we’ll be able to give you really good timeline hopefully be able to display this next generation product and one of the better what will have a much better idea where we are in terms of regulatory process in that so the ada in boston next year is in boston next year so we are kind of excited by the backup being a boston based company that would be kind of a nice coming out party for us so that’s you don’t have to timeline obviously the fda is a big piece of it i think we will be in a position to show kind of what we are doing in our product strategy there and then the regulatory path needed regulatory path michael rich – raymond james  associates inc okay that’s helps thanks and then the  in your patient adds even lift this issue in the back half of the quarter is pretty solid but are you seeing anything new on the competitive landscape tend to had a pretty good quarter you also mentioned increase activities from another new plans on the space anything maybe you can comment on that duane m desisto i think from my standpoint and this sounds like a broken record but we fight for mindshare at the doctor’s office if we’re given a fair shot i think – you know it’s pretty simple you either want tubing or you don’t want tubing you don’t want tubing with the product so we really don’t – we compete with  pounds well in this space and we fight for mindshare space and we fight for mindshare at the doctor’s office which really isn’t productrelated and rest of these guys are in this space and they’re doing what they’re doing but that’s really not the competition is really mindshare at the doctor’s office brian k roberts and to the other part of your question mike i’d add that duane in his remarks with the addition of these  new sales reps i mean this is really the first full quarter that they’re kind of out here in the field now and driving new referrals and we’re seeing an up tick in the pipeline i think the sales team overall is very engaged i think they’re excited about the resources they’re excited about still then new pod in their bag and i think overall we can feel pretty good so it’s unfortunate that payors is causing a little drop in our kind of patient conversion at the moment to just get some of those people over the goal line but we believe that’s temporary and the pipeline is still very full so i think we’re still feeling very bullish about the second half of the year and  new patient adds even with this issue given the size of the payor i think we’re still pretty happy about it michael rich – raymond james  associates inc okay and then just to clarify sort of peggy backing on that is it fair to assume then that the change in guidance reflects really only this issue and that underlying trends of the business that james told on track with what you expected duane m desisto that is  accurate yes michael rich – raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you for taking the questions operator our next question comes from mike weinstein of jpmorgan your line is open robbie marcus – jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks this is actually robbie marcus in for mike hey guys i was wondering if you could tell us what the new patient starts would have been this quarter if you exclude the payor issue duane m desisto i mean again i’d rather not get into taking these numbers and subtracting that i mean again we’re so far yeartodate we’re still up about  in total we were on track i think for a solid q as i talked about at previous conferences and we’re expecting that we’ll be able to kind of continue to hang right at least around this  number a little better throughout the back half of the year robbie marcus – jpmorgan securities llc okay so we should assume that the  number is now kind of off the table for  duane m desisto well i mean again i think you’ll have to see exactly how this issue resolves and it’s exactly anyone want it resolved but we’ve adjusted the guidance down the amount that we think is appropriate to account for this specific issue robbie marcus – jpmorgan securities llc okay and then even with the issue you guys are coming very close to profitability how are you thinking about profitability in  versus  are there any benefits were pushing at the  and how should we’ll be thinking about shares and the tax rate once you guys become profitable duane m desisto well we’ve got  million shares outstanding there’s certainly some options and other things out there which are all disclosed in the sec filings the only other big thing that’s out there is obliviously this new convertible debt issuance that we did in june so those numbers are all up there one of the nice things about the convertible debt issuance was that we effectively were able to take dilution down by about  as compared to if you look at the number of underline shares compared to what the old one was versus the new one so at some point this thing actually did convert which its not really not the goal of these it still would have saved about i think a little over  of the original amount of shares where here in regards to profitability again ill put these into the high class problems right and turning profitable is ultimately a goal we will get there we were operating profitably in q if we back out the veteran lawsuit we’ll continue to be operating profitable for the back half of the year there is some of this noncash expense that goes through exactly where it lands and then – so they have a lot nols we won’t be paying specific writing a check that much for quite a while to come but more to come i guess around tax rate and other things as we get further down the line robbie marcus – jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from steven lichtman of oppenheimer your line is open steve m lichtman – oppenheimer  co thank you hi guys i guess first question on the pipeline opportunities have you guys have talked about additional indications potentially with amgen specifically any of them when we could hear on that and then also potentially other partnerships when could we potentially hear on that front as well brian k roberts sure it’s brian so on answer like i mentioned earlier really is going very well i don’t think i think its fair to assume and i think we set this price previously that’s fair to assume that until this final one gets over the goal line completing we are actually get it into the marketplace we are not going to really move forward with additional project until that point in time several conversations with those guys we feel like there is some good opportunity is there and believe the partnership will expand but obviously getting off the start line here on this first one in the positive manner will go a long way to making sure that those happenings that said sense really the press release in announcing the answered partnership we’d had lot of inbounding asking to us asking about our product several meetings several calls several different i’d say kind of regulatory agreements in place where were we were working on other initiatives now and has some other interesting things here in the pipeline duane m desisto and i think as brian described here i think it’s the point now that we’re actually out actively recruiting the business development person for that business so we now have why i said i think we described this before the phone rang we answered the phone is ringing a lot so we’re actually taking next step we’re going to invest the money in terms of the business development person to help us start kind of – looking at these opportunity size in the month so we’re excited about it it seems to be a significant line of interest i guess we’re ready now to invest in terms of another person and the guys have been doing and they’re doing a great job it’s now – it’s now – even more feet on the street to really start qualifying this steve m lichtman – oppenheimer  co i got and then international obviously showing great growth where have you guys been successful so far and where do you see some of the biggest opportunities geographically i mean just a – comment around from the way you’re seeing that that international business looking forward duane m desisto so i think our partner internationally ypsomed they’re throughout most of western europe they continue to take market share – penetrate the markets the obvious big ones the scandinavian countries germany they kind to the way – we just – they just launched in italy while that’s not a major market it did subside i think the two opportunities that we continue to press forward with them on is we’re going through the process in france which is a very big market very good reimbursements so we haven’t had dime one out of france yet and then the other obvious one i think is in china that has a – kind of very healthy insulin pump business i think if you look at a company like novo and some of the insulin suppliers and see how much money comes out of the pacific rim it’s pretty surprising how big that business so we do think those are the two big opportunities both of which in france we are in the hopefully i would say hopefully here because we’ve probably been in the couple of times but we think we are in the final stages with ypsomed in terms of getting reimbursement and in china we continue to work our way through their sfda some of that’s kind of steve m lichtman – oppenheimer  co okay great and then just lastly on the new sales that you’ve brought on board in the first half with  new people when did they hit the ground and they’ve – when do you start expecting the start producing similar trends so we start seeing some effect in the back half of the year duane m desisto yeah i mean of the  people basically half of them hit the ground first week of may the other half hit the ground first week of june so again they averaged half a quarter basically just the amount of time they probably learned how to drive to the various places they were going to right but even with that we did see a little bit of an uptick in these key account manager territories versus if you will standard territories they were up about  in the – one versus the other which is a positive and we’re still seeing that momentum going into q so yeah i believe we will see some positive impact out of these folks in the back half of the year steve m lichtman – oppenheimer  co okay great thanks guys operator our next question comes from mimi pham of abr healthco your line is open mimi pham – abr healthco good afternoon on the managed care issue is there any implication related impacts for your pending type  launch next year duane m desisto mimi that’s a great question and i think you remember what we said time and time again is is i’m not sure just having the type  pump and going into that marketplace that you’d ever get reimbursement for when we go with lilly with the drug we were a full blown clinical results and this is a subset of type  patients that are highly insulin resistant and typically have failed at everything else so we feel confident we think the hurdle the medical necessity hurdle will be – or there will be a lot of that but we’re pretty confident that this is kind of the last stop on the train to these patients and it would be very well received but i think you have to go at it once again as we think about how big diabetes is how expensive it is it has the potential to bankrupt the united states as well as the rest of the world i think you have to go out at the real clinical – i think that’s kind of how we propose that from day one mimi pham – abr healthco okay and then regarding – dexcom last week during their earnings call said that they were ending their ending their cgm program because of technology failure to human testing so it seems like this might add more risk to your pod and cgm are you thinking about working with dexcom on the duane m desisto i think for us we would take nothing of the table we would work with anyone that obviously has a sensor i think the last step of dexcom we wanted to do shortterm and we continue to talk everybody about what we wanted to longterm having said that i think where we are just to understand what our mindset is we really do believe that’s reality issue now that we think there are products out there they can survive this reality issue we do think that this allinone app i guess we think about where medicines selling we are talking about basically having a sensor added to our product and we have the base we have the insertion system we have the power we have to do engagement we think this will be an incredibly cost effective way to incorporate operate for insulin dependent patience into a pod and we are approaching it cautiously we are not running down the street we think we get it all work now but we are listening and talking to everybody we have tested everybody sensors we are moving forward and talking to all of those guys we think that this is the work with and we still think standard of care someday is going to be one thing on the body and one thing either on your phone or one your hand mimi pham – abr healthco last with medtronic i don’t know it’s not going to pursue a disposal pump anymore is that helping at all the fields first maybe some and those who wanted to stick with medtronic given they can durable today and down the road disposal where they you talked about duane m desisto yeah once again i think it’s depends on the particular and i am not going to say it does not help i think from our standpoint i think what’s pretty competitive in the marketplace is filing mind share with these guys in the office they will more since whatever the new messages and they will go back into those offices with whatever the new message is and so like i said i think from our standpoint we heard them okay i’ll take the mapping words at the time being and what we are going to driving hard and as far as we are concern this still the guys to be mimi pham – abr healthco okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jan wald of benchmark your line is now open jan wald – the benchmark company llc good afternoon everyone a couple of short questions most everything else has been asked and answered i guess one thing is you are looking for margin improvement on the second half of the year what makes you feel comfortable that you are actually going to be able to achieve the goal that you set for yourselves duane m desisto yeah i mean most of it is at this point from our perspective relatively locked and loaded we’ve continue to work with our supply chain on the bill of materials as we continue to work our way up the volume curve we’ve got some – a very clear path on kind of reduced continuing to take costs out of product which should drive us the additional call it  or   basis points of gross margin that we should see in the back half of the year jan wald – the benchmark company llc okay and just on the sales force can you comment – it looks like you had a pretty nice bump in – moreover they were located and working – how should we understand that going forward – is the  bump kind of a bump or is it something that you continually leverage overtime – and you see that your key account managers getting into a larger proportion of the accounts that you have or how do you see that program building duane m desisto look it’s great question i think from our standpoint right now we’re sitting back watching the testing we like everything we see but i think we had said what drove us to this particular decision last year we had tested it in one particular area just to make sure that this was the right approach and then so what really kind of drive this with some of these key accounts is when you see the sales reps that had a great deal of success and they can no longer expand beyond their current installed base because there is a correlation between spending time in the doctor’s office and really developing a relationship with them so we are going to watch it we are going to continue to watch it and it is a program that i think over time we will continue to expand if we keep seeing the results fits in jan wald – the benchmark company llc do you see the i mean how you are using the key account managers are they going into your largest most important accounts at this point or once have you seen sort of a gross slowdown because the sales people they have already gotten to the point where they taken much further duane m desisto the way we are working is we’ve had sales reps go into a territory been widely successful all of a sudden  or  of –  of their business is coming out of three accounts what you see is the territories that the sales rep has to backoff and spend more and more time in there so what we are doing with those accounts is we’re bringing in this person to maintain that relationship maintain the insulet relationship with them and free it up so what really is we have a clinical specialist which is key to all this because educators want to deal with clinical specialists then the key account manager really becomes the farmer and the sales rep goes back being a humper in the territory and we can do that because i think we’ve been at it long enough in every territory we have  top accounts and then the next  accounts we evaluate where business is coming from we evaluate how much time the sales person is spending in those particular accounts and so we’ve kind of developed a little bit of a model that we think– we can see the relationship between time spend orders coming out of the office what the potential of the office is and that’s how we kind of drove the first handful key account managers and like i said once again we are monitoring it if it continues to be a successful program obviously we will roll out in other areas jan wald – the benchmark company llc thanks a lot and congratulations on the  duane m desisto thanks operator thank you our next question comes from william plovanic of canaccord genuity your line is open william plovanic – canaccord genuity inc great thanks just two detail questions one is intermodeling one is – you’ve trying to gave generalities for the international growth yearoveryear what – was it up    or nominal dollar amount can you give us an idea where that is and then my second question it is all modeling related is roughly what was the old ndi business in the quarter and that’s all i have thanks duane m desisto yeah i mean i’ve taken all the neighborhood business was effectively flat with where they were in q and the international guys the international that fleet on pace the double for the full year so that’s where that kind of continuing the track and probably been getting more specific than that william plovanic – canaccord genuity inc okay great and see you next week duane m desisto you bet brian k roberts thanks bill operator thank you there are no more questions in the queue at this time duane m desisto thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you with our q have
