forcefully beyond its consumer rootsms greene is best known as cofounder and former chief executive of vmware whose software for juggling many computing programs across many computers is widely used

same time analysts say the company’s offerings in cloud development services — computing storage data analytics and others — are already comparable to amazon’s“google is doing all these things but it is not gaining enterprise mindshare” said eric knipp an analyst at gartner “it’s not pushing in the enterprise market as much as others”google says that  percent of the fortune  companies use a paid google cloud service with email and online office documents being the most popular the business has done well mr pichai said in the interview though its performance is not broken out in google’s financial statementsyet the corporate business he said had developed largely as an “opportunistic” addon to the consumer franchise mr pichai described google’s corporate business a “journey that has organically evolved”the elevation of ms greene suggests organic evolution is no longer sufficient ms greene mr pichai said is “someone who understands enterprise needs very well” and whose goal is to

 and its aftermath a handsome paydayfor a while vmware thrived as part of emc in  emc sold  percent of vmware to the public and gave it a separate stock listing so wall street could invest in the fastgrowing subsidiary but ms greene clashed repeatedly with emc’s chief executive joseph m tucci and he fired her in july  vmware’s shares dropped  percent on the day she was oustedms greene said she

microsoft rival  business insider enterprise bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × google just added a board member from a big microsoft rival matt rosoff jan    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print mark aronica see also theres a new version of google glass and its been secretly used by hundreds of factory workers for the last two years the smartphone is eventually going to die and apple google microsoft and facebook are racing to kill it google has a new plan to make the entire internet faster google has just added a th board member diane b greene a cofounder and former ceo of vmware a leading enterprise computing player its interesting that of all the areas google is in  consumer internet services mobile phones consumer electronics  they picked a board member frm the enterprise computing world particularly from a company that microsoft views as one of its top competitors that could mean that google is going to take our advice and begin paying more attention to its google apps enterprise business apps is already notching up some big wins but a lot of its parts are still missing key features that theyd need to act as a complete replacement for microsoft office and other traditional business software vmware the company where greene made her name makes virtualization software which basically allows multiple virtual computers to run on a single piece of hardware saving hardware costs it can also allow multiple different operating systems to run which lessens the pressure to standardize on microsoft windows larry page did not name google apps among his top priorities when he took the ceo job last year its not one of the seven main product groups and google does not usually mention it on its earnings calls it still accounts for less than  billion in annual revenue despite being six years old but theres a lot of money suddenly flowing into cloudbased enterprise disruptors again  companies like box workday and cloudra are raising big rounds jive had a successful ipo and sap bought successfactors for more than  billion maybe google figured it was time to start paying more attention to this trend or maybe they just wanted another technical outsider on the board googles board currently consists of nine people but three are company execs and one john doerr  is a vc from googles original big investor so having more outside blood could make the board stronger and more able to stand up to questionable decisions by its executive

release date january  duration  interviewers lucy sanders larry nelson lee kennedyseries entrepreneurial heroes transcript an interview with diane greene founder vmware date january   interview with diane greene introduction music lucy sanders hi this is lucy sanders the ceo of the national center for women in information technology or ncwit with me is leigh kennedy one of our fine board members as well as a serial entrepreneur herself hi leigh leigh kennedy hi lucy thanks for having me today lucy also larry nelson from ww hi larry larry nelson im so happy to be here this is a wonderful series and what we really like about it it really helps other people lucy absolutely we have great interviews in this series with wonderful entrepreneurs we are now over  interviews in our series and i felt very excited about that leigh wow lucy today we are interviewing a person who i consider to be one of the top entrepreneurs i know cofounder and founding ceo of vmware diane greene vmware is one of those companies i know many of our listeners have heard about because it introduced something really really innovative which was a virtualization layer between hardware and software that allows different operating systems to run on the same machine that was pretty cool and that was one of vmwares really innovative leads into the market truly revolutionary when the company went public in  it was silicon valleys biggest ipo since google no small accomplishment so we cant wait to talk to diane she left vmware in  but she continues to invest in companies and to advise entrepreneurs and she serves on very impressive boards such as intuit mit corporation and more diane welcome diane greene well thanks very much its always good to participate in the entrepreneurial community in any way i can lucy so lets get right to the questions diane were really interested in understanding how you first got into technology as you look at the technologies out there today which ones do you think are especially cool diane well ive always had an orientation around science and engineering in high school i built a model bridge with movable trusses and instrumented one of them with a strange gauge that really launched me into what i found out was called engineering i was also really active racing sailboats which meant maintaining them and tuning them which was a lot of technology to keep the boat going fast in addition to racing it so i would say i started doing things in technology in high school nothing like what the kids are doing today with their computers but certainly technology in terms of what is out there today thats really exciting like everybody else its mobile connectivity the social networking the sensors particularly around imaging all these things contributing to our ability to have a digitally enhanced world is tremendously exciting larry boy ill say i have a feeling that if i was going to try to recruit a relationship with you that if my company started with the letter v like in vermont i would get a little bit further lucy laughs leigh i didnt understand it either lucy i didnt understand it either thats ok diane its possible because im puzzled about what youre talking about larry i was just looking at vmware vxtreme diane oh v i thought you said z thats right vmware vxtreme completely coincidental vmware we were looking for a name and at the time during the dot com bubble every url was taken so we said lets do a placeholder i thought lets just do something really descriptive as a placeholder virtual machine software call it vmware so the name stuck lucy well thats an interesting story larry yeah leigh yeah it is lucy diane im going to jump into the next question diane our pr person didnt want to talk to us because they thought what a boring name leigh and larry laugh leigh i think its a good name larry yeah i like it lucy so diane ill jump in to the next question were always curious how people that are really into technology and science and they make the leap to be an entrepreneur which is not always second nature to a lot of technologists so tell us about how that happened and what it is about entrepreneurship that you love diane well ive always also been an organizer i always have started new things very early on when i was actually still in high school back in  i got into windsurfing i was the only windsurfer on the east coast i started an ice hockey team in college so ive always in addition to having an affinity for technology i also like to organize i like to do things with other people i think im not particularly good at working for other people if our visions arent aligned that kind of pushes me towards leading people and being in charge i think its a desire to do new things organize new things and make new things happen the technology background is just helpful and is why my entrepreneurship is around technology i guess larry youve done so many different things i know youre going to have a great career ahead of you its just the beginning in your career path who was either a mentor or someone who was a role model that really influenced your future diane well i have to say my family had an enormous influence on me for better or for worse then i had an absolutely amazing band teacher in high school that set up a system for measuring how we were doing which made it extremely clear how to get ahead and how to become first chair and then had us all working together amazingly well as a band and as an orchestra to where our little motley crew would go on and win state championships i had her as my band and orchestra teacher for three years and i think she had an enormous influence on me she could have managed a huge laughs corporation she had all those fundamental principles and skills down then as ive gone through my career in silicon valley in the tech industry i would have to say i had a mentor at tandem computers named franco putzolo who really taught me how to take a measured approach to whatever it was i was doing and helped develop my ability to try and really take the time to always do things well lucy well you know when we started the interview we said we get a lot of interesting answers to these questions and thats the first time weve heard a band teacher diane laughter ive only said this one other time when i was being interviewed at vmware and the absolutely amazing thing is i got emails from someone else that had been in her band and orchestra and said yes she was my mentor too lucy well i think thats fascinating and perfectly understandable when you think about a lot of great technologists are great musicians leigh exactly yup lucy and i can see where a band and orchestra lots of life skills there so fascinating answer diane what is the toughest thing youve ever had to do in your career diane working for other people that i wasnt able to convince them of my vision lucy thats hard diane that really was laughs the most difficult thing leigh yeah thats always tough and i think one of the reasons a lot of entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs is they dont like working for other people so laughs laughter leigh that makes perfect sense laughs diane we can have the same vision but thats not the norm i mean normally its the leader that sets the vision and doesnt necessarily take the vision ofits also formative because when you are the leader youre very sensitive to the fact that you need to laughs incorporate everybody elses vision or theyre going to feel frustrated also its good for the company because you dont always have the right vision yourself at least i dont but yeah i do think it drives a lot of entrepreneurship is this need to work on a vision that youre really passionate about so youre left with no laughs choice but to do it yourself leigh well that brings us to our next question we have a lot of young people and people wanting to become entrepreneurs that listen to our interviews so if you were sitting here with a young person looking to become an entrepreneur what advice would you give to them diane if they have a vision of something there are infinite ways to improve the world if you really see something that really excites you then set about doing it and do it right dont cut any corners go about it with absolute quality in every way you approach it and think it through and execute on it larry well im tying right in with that what are your personal characteristics do you think that have given you the advantage of being an entrepreneur diane i dont start something unless i can really see for myself how it can be done how its possible then once i see that i dont think of failure as an option theres always a way to make it successful and im pretty relentless about that i think also i really love and get energized from working with other people laughs when theyre smarter than me and thats not always hard so i think those two things that relentless there is a way and then just enjoying finding that way with other people really has helped me have a lot of successes as an entrepreneur lucy relentless is a word we hear a lot leigh and failure not being an option lucy and failure not being an option i think that those are great personal characteristics to have diane we ask one other question around how entrepreneursits not so much bringing balance into your personal and professional lives but how do you integrate them diane well i see it as my life i do what i care about and what i want to do and so part of that is my family and raising my family and part of that is going on outdoor adventures which i dont do nearly as much as i would like to building things i think has been a large part ofits of course been building companies in the tech industry but there are fundamental principles about how i go about things that are utterly consistent across everything i do so that integrates them pretty naturally leigh diane youve done some just really really interesting things that were like leading edge in many areassports technology tell us about what youre passionate about now or whats next for you diane im really not sure whats next im working on it and i definitely want a big project in my life leigh well thats a great answer too laughs we dont always know and its good to know that youre in that spot lucy well when youre in that spot you can pay attention and actually look for the next big project larry there you go lucy yeah absolutely well diane thanks very much for talking to us we really appreciate it i wanted to remind listeners where they can hear this interview at wwcom and also ncwitorg diane yeah and let me just send a word of encouragement to people i think when you want to do something you can always do it and make a success of it good luck larry well thank you for that lucy thank you diane leigh thanks diane create a new collection select a collectioneeee alliances academic alliance affinity alliance entrepreneurial

also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
