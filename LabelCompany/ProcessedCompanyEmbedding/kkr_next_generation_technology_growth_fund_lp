umesh mishra chairman of transphorm inc stated transphorm was launched to address the urgent and important problem of losses in power conversion a process that converts electricity from the form it is delivered to the form that is ultimately used we are delighted kkr has chosen to invest in transphorm by merging the technological leadership of transphorm with the semiconductor business expertise of kkr we are taking a major step forward in solving the global problem of energy wasted in power conversion transphorm believes that there is a very large market for its products as its ultraefficient power devices and modules can eliminate more than  of all electric conversion losses by using gallium nitride gan a new semiconductor material that switches at far higher speeds than traditional components ganbased technology known for its connection to the  nobel prize in physics creates a brighter more energy efficient light that today is the basis of the multibillion dollar ledbased lighting industry similarly when applied to power conversion gan components enable significantly more efficient compact and costeffective products gallium nitride is the most important new semiconductor in the world today said dr shuji nakamura  nobel laureate in physics and director of the solid state lighting and energy electronics center ssleec at uc santa barbara my invention of the ganbased led and solid state lighting has changed the world in illumination gallium nitride is also the best material for power conversion and is essential to eliminate the enormous amount of energy wasted in these processes transphorm is the leading company producing ganbased power conversion products that will have the same positive impact on energy we saw with ledbased lighting transphorms products deliver world class efficiency power density and power savings they have a power efficiency of up to  in data centers and telecom applications resulting in energy savings of over gwh annually in a typical datacenter or the equivalent of the annual electricity usage of  typical us homes in addition to pv inverters and datacenters other applications for transphorms technology include power supplies motor drives and automotive systems manufacturers are now producing the worlds smallest pv inverters by leveraging transphorms technology in their products transphorm has established strategic partnerships with industryleading customers and suppliers yaskawa electric corporation a global leader in motion control robotics and systems engineering launched the first ganbased commercially produced solar photovoltaic pv inverter powered by transphorm gan in the japan market earlier this year transphorms products enable approximately  smaller pv inverters in residential and small commercial installations up to kw resulting in lower system installation and service costs while at the same time delivering more energy per solar panel to the grid tata power solar one of the pioneering solar manufacturers in the world and indias leading power conversion player has also teamed with transphorm to develop leading edge pv inverters in order to provide customers with high quality volume production transphorm partnered with fujitsu semiconductor to produce its products in fujitsus automotiveclass wafer fabrication facility in aizuwakamatsu japan transphorms technology is paving the way for a revolutionary change in energy efficiency right now transphorm is the only place where customers can acquire reliable production volume gan products that meet or exceed required performance specs for commercial products long term we believe this has the potential to replace all of the existing siliconbased technology used in high voltage products and wide adoption of this technology will dramatically reduce the amount of energy that is wasted by electric devices david kerko senior advisor of kkr said for kkr the investment is part of the firms growth equity
