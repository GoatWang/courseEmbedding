newsletters equity coinvestment share definition of equity coinvestment a minority investment made by investors in a company alongside a private equity fund manager or venture capital firm equity coinvestment enables investors to get in on potentially very profitable investments without paying the usual fees charged by the private equity fund equity coinvestment opportunities are generally restricted to large institutional investors who already have existing relationships with the private equity fund manager and are typically not available to retail investors   breaking down equity coinvestment   why would a private equity fund manager give away a lucrative opportunity private equity is usually invested through a limited partnership lp vehicle in a portfolio of companies in certain situations the lps funds may already be fully committed to  a number of companies which means that if another prime opportunity turns up the private equity fund manager may either have to pass up the opportunity or offer it to some investors as an equity coinvestment   most limited partners pay a  management fee and  carried interest to the fund manager who is the general partner however coinvestors may benefit from lower fees or no fees in some cases which would boost returns available to them a  study showed that investor appetite for coinvestment opportunities was at an alltime high the survey of  limited partners showed that  had coinvested in at least one past portfolio company deal while more than  reported they were looking for coinvestment opportunities trading center
