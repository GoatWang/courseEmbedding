exporters of certain gspeligible items do not act by monday november  nine products from six countries would likely lose dutyfree entry into the us market under the generalized system of preferences starting on july   sandler trade llc has identified nine tariff lines that currently exceed or could exceed the competitive need limitation cnl thresholds by statute if a country demonstrates “competitiveness” as defined by obtaining  of total us imports in a tariff line or if a tariff line has total us imports of  million from a country in  then the gspeligible country will lose dutyfree treatment for the specific tariff line the two tables below list the tariff lines and the corresponding countries that are in danger of losing dutyfree entry into the us market under gsp next july  the gsp statute allows for “interested parties” us importers exporters or trade associations to petition to retain dutyfree treatment for a tariff line that exceeds the cnl thresholds if successful the petition can result in a competitive need limitation cnl waiver which retains dutyfree treatment for a product for at least five years petitions for cnl waivers are due on monday november  which is only two weeks away as the “duties savings” column from the tables below demonstrate us importers have significant money at stake with duty savings ranging from several hundred thousand to millions

natural disaster recovery posted on may   by marideth international trade fuels emergingmarket development through growing a stable middle class empowering women and creating jobs and sustainable economies especially in remote communities and neighborhoods where the concepts of “hope” and “a good future” are rare commodities the generalized system of preferences gsp has expanded us imports from emerging markets –  of the world’s economies – since  more recently the caribbean basin initiatives cbi and the african growth and opportunity act agoa have provided even more opportunities for us importers to source a wider variety of goods dutyfree from nations in the caribbean and subsaharan africa congressional commitments to use trade to fuel economic stability and growth have been successful the month lapse of gsp since august   has resulted in us imports under gsp dropping by  in the first quarter of  as compared to a year earlier and a backdrop of essentially an overall flat us import situation the negative in this case helps to prove the positive the current agoa extension and enhancement act takes the recognition of trade fueling economic stability to a new level agoa’s trade benefits would be authorized for a tenyear period through the agoa extension and enhancement act this would address investors’ longstanding needs for duty treatment stability so that they may recoup their investments haiti too would benefit from the act’s fiveyear program extension international trade – linking emerging market suppliers to us importers – is also a powerful driver of reconstruction investment and economic renewal following natural disasters an important example is haiti for which congress established the use of trade as a way to help a country recover from a devastating earthquake the haiti economic lift program help expanded opportunities for haitianmade textile and apparel to enter the us market free of duty at first investment – largely from the public sector – needed to be coaxed after haiti’s exports to the us market began to grow the potential for even greater trade expansion and diversity attracted private and public investment the results are a

magnitude earthquake on may   the death toll is nearly  people with more than  people injured and  missing the earthquakes’ economic impacts are farreaching  the us geological survey estimates losses could exceed nepal’s  billion annual gross domestic product nepal’s needs are parallel and equally intense to those of haiti nepal is a landlocked mountainous country of  million people it is in a challenging transitional period following the end of a year internal conflict nepal is among the world’s poorest countries with a percapita gross national income of  which is less than half of south asia’s regional level similar to haiti low investor confidence stagnant export diversification and growing remittance dependence had characterized nepal’s preearthquake economy to counter these

imports from nepal totaled about  million in  with textile and apparel items comprising more than  of the total nepal’s businesses and workers had achieved us european union and global market presence for its men and women’s apparel as well as its carpets pashminas gloves and hats stable economic growth had begun the earthquakes have flattened much of the country but the use of trade as a way to rebuild has already taken hold as a way to help their countryman nepali businesses and tailors whose facilities are intact are donating nepali shirts for purchase by international consumers with the proceeds to be spent for relief incountry the embassy of nepal and thousands of nepalese and friends of nepal living in the united states hope that congress will enact s  the nepal preferences act

renew gsp now – and end recordsetting lapse posted on november   by marideth november   marked the month anniversary of the lapse in congressional authorization of the generalized system of preferences gsp this lapse is now the longest in the year history of the gsp – a fact costing us importers approximately  million every day  million since the july   expiration and that has led to canceled orders from thousands of businesses in gsp countries the  geographically and economically diverse countries of alliance believe that the final months of the th congress are an opportune time for congress to put gsp on its “mustdo” lists either by attaching gsp renewal to other moving bills or by passing s and hr  the urgency of the situation – job losses and business closures in importing and supplying nations especially among small and mediumsized businesses – is clear the alliance cites an important example maria roseni alvero commercial counselor in the philippines embassy pointed out that “in the case of philippine coconut farmers in the typhoon haiyanaffected areas they have become even more reliant on gsp so that they can export competitively to the us market resuming operation of gsp is a key factor to aid in their recovery from the devastation caused by the super typhoon” the kyrgyz republic and lebanon recently joined the alliance to request gsp renewal in   of lebanon’s exports to the us market entered under gsp lebanese businesses have been especially affected since the gsp lapse lebanon’s exports entering under gsp dropped  in  through september as compared to a year earlier examples are lebanon’s jewelry exports down  and exports of building stone nuts gherkins and olive oil items exported in small amounts by lebanon’s farmers artisans and other businesses have decreased by half the gsp lapse creates an urgent situation for the  gsp countries and especially for  nations that benefit from no other us preference program background gsp benefits more than  billion people living in twothirds of the world’s economies when gsp is in operation us companies can import up to  products dutyfree such as raw materials intermediary goods and consumerready items from suppliers in  emerging markets information on the alliance and gsp is available at wwwallianceforgsporg media contacts are romulo cabeza sandler trade llc at

marked the oneyear anniversary of the lapse in congressional authorization of the generalized system of preferences gsp the member alliance of gsp countries has expressed disappointment that congress did not renew gsp prior to leaving washington for its august recess the ongoing lapse in gsp impacts the livelihood of thousands of small and mediumsized businesses in the united states and in gspbeneficiary countries since august   us businesses have paid reinstated import duties for products from gspeligible countries costing us importers  million thus far or approximately  million per day exporters from gspeligible countries have felt the impacts as well us customers have canceled orders from hundreds of businesses in gsp countries and are reconsidering their commercial ties with gsp countries in favor of lowcost producers the lack of gsp not only hurts the bottom line for businesses worldwide and in the united states but also undermines the us strategic goals of deepening economic ties and overall partnerships with developing economies the alliance applauded the bipartisan efforts of the senate and house of representatives trade leadership when they introduced legislation in july  to extend gsp now a year later the continued absence of gsp illustrates the difficulty in finding a viable legislative path the geographically and economically diverse group of alliance countries strongly urges congress to renew gsp when it returns from its august recess gsp provides dutyfree treatment for up to  types of us imports from  emerging economies us imports from gsp beneficiary countries benefit the livelihoods of more than  billion people living in twothirds of the world’s economies gsp also strengthens the us economy by generating tens of thousands of jobs and providing us manufacturers with needed inputs since the expiration american importers have lost sales stopped hiring and delayed expansion plans information on the alliance and gsp is available at

report calls for simplified products to end savings ripoff savings review ban on commissions for feehungry financial advisers charges to be capped by katherine griffiths tuesday  july   bst click to followthe independent online private investors could have access to a raft of new simple and cheap pensions and savings products under proposals published yesterday by a governmentsponsored review into the financial services industryron sandler the former chief operating officer of natwest bank appointed to conduct the review has urged the government to adopt his vision of creating a range of products that are so straightforward people could even buy them from their supermarketthis would bypass current rules which require wouldbe investors to seek financial advice or at the very least to go through lengthy questionnaires to make sure a product is right for themmr sandlers suggested safe haven products which could include pensions and investments such as unit trusts would have capped charges and no hidden penaltiesthe recommendation comes after mr sandler found in his month review of the pensions and savings industry evidence that it is so complex that most people do not have even a basic understanding of financial mattersconsumers are reluctant to engage with the industry because they dont understand or trust it and competitive forces are not delivering value for money he saidmr sandler believes companies have not done enough to make their offerings transparent and simple especially in the withprofits arena making it difficult for consumers to identify the best and worst in the marketthe lack of transparency mr sandler argued has also led to many investors with modest means putting money into funds managed actively by individuals when in many cases they would be better in lowcost passive funds which track an index such as the ftse as well as introducing a new range of safe and simple products which he gave a working title of stakeholder products after the lowcost pension of that name mr sandler is also calling for a shake up of the tax regime tax breaks on pensions should stay he says but the rules should be simplified so consumers can compare different types of savings and investmentsto complete the programme of change mr sandler wants to tighten rules on financial advice for those who still want to go to an adviser to buy a product not in the new stakeholder category he proposes that independent advisers be banned from receiving commission from companies which is often hidden in the sales processmr sandlers ideas were welcomed by the treasury which set up the review last june ruth kelly economic secretary to the treasury said this report sets out a vision of a simpler more transparent and more competitive longterm savings industryit is likely the government will take many of the recommendations on board because it is desperate to find ways to boost the amount of money people are saving because the current working generation is on average putting away £bn less than it should for old ageit is a particularly tall order at the moment as two years of falling stock markets millions of endowment policies not paying off peoples mortgages and crises in the life assurance sector have combined to hit public confidence furtherconsumer bodies also threw their weight behind mr sandlers call for reform sheila mckechnie director of the consumers association said this has correctly diagnosed the fundamental failings of the financial services industry it shows that sole reliance on the market to deliver competition does not workthe financial services authority and the association of british insurers gave the report a more cautious welcome more about investment natwest retail savings supermarkets reuse content
