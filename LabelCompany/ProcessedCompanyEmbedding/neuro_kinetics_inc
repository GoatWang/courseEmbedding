concussion statistics and resources   mild traumatic brain injury traumatic brain injury tbi is the result of a blunt blow jolt or blast overpressure to the head that disrupts brain function  the terms mild tbi mtbi and concussion are commonly used interchangeably and have been linked with post traumatic stress disorder  the severity of head injuries range from a brief change in mental status or consciousness to extended unconsciousness and amnesia  in severe or multiple concussion cases personality changes can occur with devastating results   the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that at least  million americans currently have a longterm or lifelong need for help to perform activities of daily living as a result of a tbi  currently there is no accepted clinical method to objectively detect mtbi our solutions note investigational use only neuro kinetics inc does not have fda clearance for mtbi or concussion indications nki’s comprehensive iportal® neurootologic test devices are in wide use as a diagnostic tool for early disease detection by audiologists ent’s neurootologists neuroophthalmologist and neurologists all over the world  the same multimodal tool is being used in research investigations to detect mtbi and to monitor recovery from head trauma the iportal® tests are neurophysiologic measuring the eyes response to various motion oculomotor and optokinetic stimuli  early data shows iportal® tests can detect abnormalities resulting from head trauma even when structural imaging technologies show no damage  the test battery also suggests the data is significantly more objective than current neuropsychological tests that rely partially on patient self diagnosis nki is collaborating with military and sports medicine researchers to study new methods to objectively diagnose and monitor blast and blunt force head traumaour battery of tests can help examiners make better return to play and return to duty decisions military mtbi research iportal® notc currently in use at  department of defense dod and veterans administration va hospitals to detect tbi and mtbi and to monitor recoveries part of multiple dod research studies on mtbi sports medicine concussion research with support from a major health system we are in the midst of an important high school athlete study to refine and validate the iportal® test battery  nki is collecting base line data at the beginning of the sports season to compare post trauma for head injuries sustained during the season coauthored paper on head trauma that resulted from a bicycle accident  the case study presented a unique opportunity to compare pre and post trauma data and monitor the healing process  read here statistics read mtbi statistics and resources publications
