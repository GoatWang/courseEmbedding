about breyer horses breyer® models begin as beautiful horse sculptures created by leading equine artists that are then cast into a copper and steel mold each model is created one at a time from the original mold which is injected with a special resin selected by breyer for its ability to capture the depth of detail delicate feel and richness of color in our models once the model is molded breyer’s artisans take over and the handwork begins each individual breyer® model is prepped and finished by hand and then turned over to the painting department for hand painting with airbrushes and detailing with paint brushes in all some  artisans work on each individual model horse creating an exquisite handmade model horse that is as individual as the horse that inspired it  farrier lets go

naturally gluten free  we are currently updating our packaging to make it easy for you to identify all of our naturally gluten free variants it is our policy that when any of the eight most common allergens milk eggs fish wheat tree nuts peanuts soybeans and crustaceans occur in any of our products they will be listed inside the ingredient statement in plain language  what is a frozen dairy dessert frozen dairy dessert products are made with many of the same highquality ingredients that are commonly found in ice cream – like fresh milk cream and sugar – and offer a great taste and even smoother texture according to the fda in order for a product to be labeled ice cream it needs to meet two key requirements not less than  dairy fat a percentage of overrun that results in a finished product weighing more than  pounds per gallon anything that does not meet both of those requirements is not considered ice cream  why did breyers make the change to frozen dairy dessert our consumers are at the center of every recipe decision we make we work hard to understand what people want most and work to give them the best possible product experience people have told us they have various flavor or texture preferences for example some tell us that they want a smoother texture which is what we’re able to deliver with our frozen dairy dessert products  does frozen dairy dessert taste different than ice cream we  have conducted several national taste tests across different flavor profiles to determine how our frozen dairy dessert products perform against ice cream on important product attributes in these sidebyside taste tests our fans told us they liked the new recipe just as much as the original the  ultimate measure of consumer feedback is whether our consumers are purchasing the product breyers blasts which has a frozen dairy dessert standard of identity is the most popular and fastestgrowing segment of our business  are there nutritional benefits to frozen dairy dessert frozen dairy dessert tends to have less fat than ice cream  are there breyers flavors that are not frozen dairy dessert yes breyers offers a wide range of products to meet the different taste nutritional and value needs of consumers breyers continues to offer many flavors of ice cream including natural vanilla natural strawberry chocolate mint chocolate chip and coffee  what is the packaging difference between ice cream and frozen dairy dessert these products follow all legal  regulatory requirements for packaging and thus claim frozen dairy dessert on the front of the pack additionally the ingredient list and nutritional information is updated to reflect changes  does the price of frozen dairy dessert products differ from that of ice cream the suggested retail price for frozen dairy dessert varieties will be consistent with the current ice cream products  what does breyers mean when they say that frozen dairy dessert is blended in a new way to manufacture our frozen dairy dessert varieties we use a new manufacturing technique that allows us to more effectively break down molecules of dairy fat and more evenly distribute them throughout the product to deliver a smoother texture with less milk fat solids  how can i contact breyers for questions or comments through the ask breyers page on our website or by calling us at    what is gluten gluten is a family of proteins found in many cereal grains according to the us food and drug administration fda gluten refers to the proteins that occur naturally in wheat rye barley and crossbreeds of these grains

likely to break other serious health problems may include diabetes autoimmune thyroid dis­ease and intestinal cancers us food and drug administration celiac disease affects people differently according to the celiac disease foundation there are about  known symptoms which may occur in the digestive system or other parts of the body some people with celiac disease have no symptoms at all celiac disease foundation  celiac disease has no cure but individuals who have this disease are advised to avoid all sources of gluten in their diet to protect against adverse health effects

breyers® ice cream frozen dessert currently claim to be gluten free i do not have celiac disease and i do not strive to eliminate gluten from my diet why did you move to gluten free breyers® products
