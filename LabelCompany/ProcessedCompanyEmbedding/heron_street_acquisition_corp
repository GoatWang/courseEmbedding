two months ago the logo of news website the huffington post seen on a computer screen photo nicholas kammagence francepressegetty images the plan is to have ms heron and ms huffington jointly steer the huffington post further toward embracing the “distributed content” philosophy being evangelized by the likes of buzzfeed—that is the strategy of publishing unique content on social media platforms they still plan to maintain the huffington post’s distinctive brand and core audience ms huffington said “we’ve been expediting this transition to distributed content” said ms huffington “and we’re a huge destination site stillwith a very identified brand” just prior to ms heron’s arrival at facebook the company had launched facebook paper a standalone news reading application that never really took off but since then facebook’s importance to the digital publishing business—and its power to spread content—has only grown during ms heron’s tenure the company introduced facebook instant
