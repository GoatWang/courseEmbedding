and good morning everyone thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal  conference call our fourth quarter results are highlighted by strong sequential revenue growth and margin accretion we generated fourth quarter total revenue of  million an increase of  sequentially and  yearoveryear and nongaap eps of  for the full fiscal year  we generated  million of revenue and nongaap eps of  from an overall market perspective our current view is that planned budgets for calendar  will remain flat with  levels demand trends underline flattish budgets in  overwhelmingly point to an accelerated reduction in spend on legacy it as enterprises take an aggressive stand on improving the efficiencies of their outsourcing program by mandating suppliers to reduce effort apply automation and commit to significant yearoveryear cost reduction while there is significant compression on traditional outsourcing spend we are also seeing a commensurate increase in investment in digital solutions that reshape and reimagine our clients business models our leadership position in the digital transformation and operational excellence positions us well in this environment to gain share and deliver above industry growth in fiscal  having spent some time conducting additional research and analysis including discussions with independent analysts to determine how the industry measures digital revenue we have updated our methodology for calculating our digital revenues and currently estimate that approximately one third of our total revenue is generated from digital services driven by increased spending in this area our strategic position and our robust suite of digital offering our overall digital revenue is growing well above the company average in addition to this and unlike generation one outsource the majority of our operational excellence revenue is from a consumeroriented strategic platform which requires significant modernization to support the rapidly emerging demand of an endtoend digital business our operational excellence revenue in support of endtoend digital journey is excluded from our calculations of digital revenue given the accelerating shift we are seeing in our clients spend two digital solutions and in order to capitalize on this long term growth opportunity we will be increasing our focus and investment in fiscal year  on for the scaling our digital capability to capitalize on the significant longterm growth opportunity the recently announced longterm strategic investment by the orogen group along with the appointment of vikram s pandit to our board is an important strategic step in this direction vikrams extensive experience in banking and financial services and his deep strategic insights will be of tremendous value as we refined our goforward strategy strengthened our solutions and services and capitalized on the significant dislocation taking place in the bfs segment additionally we are delighted to have the opportunity to work with vikram and his team at orogen and their tearoff leadership team to bring our leading digital transformation and operational excellence solution to enterprise in their network we are very excited about the business possibilities ahead of us to help provide you with some perspective on the growth opportunity in our digital business and why we are so optimistic about the potential for virtusa id like to discuss some of the industry trends we are seeing and ways we are helping our clients leverage digital solutions to reimagine and expand the addressable market capture a larger percentage of millennial consumers and grow wallet share with their existing customers the banking and financial services industry is facing significant pressure as a result of fintech upstarts reimagining and launching new digital business model that target a rapidly growing millennial and digitallysavvy consumer base unscapped my legacy fintech entrants are leveraging technology and launching new products and solutions that are fundamentally reshaping the banking and financial services industry at an unprecedented pace this is pushing the bfs industry to greatly expand their investment in digital transformation to remain competitive in this quickly changing environment among us banks we are seeing institutions of all types ph rapidly expanding their spend on digital technologies and transformational programs in fact in some instances we are seeing as much as  increase in digital spend yearoveryear in midtier banks while most tier  us banks are growing their digital spend by as much as  yearoveryear the focus of this spend is to build new channels and revenue streams in the marketplace and to disrupt and gain market share as an early entrant earlier in fiscal  i discussed how virtusa was selected by a large tier one bank to build its nextgeneration mobile retail banking platform one of the largest mobile banking engagements in the industry todate im pleased to share that things are going very well on this engagement and our expanded capability as a result of the polaris acquisition led to us being selected by this client as their business banking partner to digitize the experience of their business users this is a great example of how we are focused on expanding our digital business within our existing clients weve also recently selected by a large regional bank to build the endtoend architecture for their proprietary mobile wallet and execute their fintech festival utilizing core assets from our fintech lab we were chosen because of our leadership position in the digital transformation and our deep banking and financial services industry knowledge on the digital transformation side many of the largest enterprises in the industries we operate in rely on virtusa for their endtoend digital solutions and services our deep knowledge of bfs the sheer number of tier one bfs clients we work with and our fintech lab allows us to provide differentiation and strong reference as we pursue similar opportunity in a rapidly expanding market we are very pleased with how we are positioned and the progress we are making on this front the strong growth we are seeing in digital also extends beyond banking and financial services in the pharmaceutical industry we are seeing demand for clinical trial solutions that help accelerate the launch of new products and improve the efficacy of trials as a fortune  global pharmaceutical company for example we implemented a central pharmaceutical trial intelligence hub for ondemand insights to support data driven decisionmaking our solution helped our client reduce its product time to market and costs through clinical insights and proactive risk management in the telecom industry digital transformation continues to focus in the area of improving the customer experience and to provide products and services faster and cheaper going to confirm looking to virtusa to help enable customer analytics to improve the customer experience and reduce churn that booked analytics to reduce the cost of operating their network and operational analytics to automate and optimize the operations our overall digital pipeline grew  yearoveryear in the fiscal fourth quarter and we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing our digital business as we enter fiscal year  while digital will be a key focus of our growth engine in fiscal  we will also continue to make sure we leverage our operational excellence expertise to provide disruptive cost savings opportunity for clients who are demanding great operating efficiencies of their legacy outsourcing agreements operational excellence continues to be a critical component of our business as clients across all our industry verticals and geographies are looking to generate a sustained reduction in their legacy it and business at usual costs the capital our client saved through our operational excellence solution can then be reinvested back into the business to execute against that digital transformation plan we believe virtusa will be a beneficiary of this ongoing trend in the bfs segment we recently won a multimillion dollar multiyear engagement hedging out three generation one it competitors because of our ability to reduce our software development costs by  by compressing effort automating and eliminating technical debt additionally we are working with our client to build a scalable automation platform which could automate approximately  of their software development cycle similarly i spoke with you last quarter about how we are working with a large tier  us bank to drive endtoend automation leveraging our gamified ph continuous integration continuous deployment platform to help drive  million in cost savings in one year we are seeing more and more tier  banks coming to us with a request to help them identify pockets of optimization and create a path for them where they can start to see over  cost reduction in the sphere we believe that gives us a significant edge to disrupt and display generation one incumbence as another example in the healthcare segment we are seeing a growing rate of adoption around robotics and automation at health care there continues to be pressure on health care organizations to reduce cost and a brief ph to utilize rpa solutions to perform repeatable rules based tasks has shown the potential to write cost down for example we recently utilized digital labor to improve the efficiencies in handling claims fall out for a large regional pair in another example we were engaged by a large national health care pair to use robotics to validate the quality and accuracy of their complex products offered to members we believe this is just the beginning of a path toward a multiyear journey around utilizing robotics and robotic process automation to automate several business processes in conclusion looking back at fiscal year  i am pleased with the progress we made and against our strategic plan we successfully completed the integration of polaris in fiscal year  and we continue to capitalize on the significant synergies created by this acquisition looking ahead i virtusa enters fiscal year  in a position of strength well positioned to capture increasing market share in the digital transformation and operational excellence leading to sustained above industry growth based on the strong momentum we are seeing in the market for digital services and our leadership position in digital we will increase our and investment to capture an increasing percentage of this rapidly expanding market in fiscal year  the recent law on strategic investment by the orogen group and the additional vikram s pandit to our board will be instrumental in our ability to strategically position but to serve and for the strengthen our position as the trusted partner for enterprise embarking on endtoend digital transformation or operational excellence initiatives we are very enthusiastic about the changes taking place in our industry and how were to size positioned to intersect key growth drivers now let me turn the call over to ranjan who will provide more details on our results and our first quarter and fiscal year  guidance ranjan ranjan kalia thanks kris and good morning to everyone let me start by summarizing the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year  i will then discuss our current guidance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending march   before opening the call for questions revenue for our fiscal  fourth quarter was  million this represents  sequential growth in reported currency and  in constant currency yearoveryear our fourth quarter revenue increased  in reported currency and  in constant currency gross margin in the fourth quarter was  up  basis points from  in the prior quarter the sequential increase in our fourth quarter gross margin was primarily driven by increased billable utilizations and benefits from the cost savings programs we initiated in november of last year gross margin however was below our expectations primarily due to higher than contemplated visa fees gaap operating income for the fourth quarter was  million up from  million in the prior quarter and  million in the year ago period sga expenses were below our expectations in the fourth quarter fourth quarter sga expense included approximately  of restructuring charges related to our cost savings initiative fourth quarter other income was  million comprised of  million of unrealized foreign exchange gain and  of net interest and other expense the fx includes a  million fx gain on our intercompany loan that was put in place to fund the polaris transaction partially offset by  million of fx losses from other foreign denominated balances we recognized a gaap tax expense of  million in the fourth quarter this was above our prior expectations during the fourth quarter we repatriated  million of cash from our dutch entity established for financing the polaris transaction resulting in a  million tax expense which was offset by tax benefits in certain geographies gaap earnings per diluted share inclusive of minority interest expense was  in the fourth quarter compared with  in the prior quarter and  in the year ago period our q gaap eps was above the midpoint of our prior guidance turning to our nongaap results nongaap operating income was  million up from  million in the prior quarter and compared to  million in the year ago period fourth quarter nongaap operating margin was  compared to  in the prior quarter and  in the year ago period the sequential increase in our nongaap operating margin primarily refracts improved gross margin an sga nongaap diluted earnings per share was  in our fourth quarter of fiscal  this compares to  in the prior quarter and  in the year ago period our q nongaap eps was below the midpoint of our guidance range primarily due to lower gross margin resulting from higher than expected visa fees turning to the balance sheet ending cash at march   was  million inclusive of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments cash flow from operating activities was  in the fourth quarter compared with  million in the prior quarter our dso including unbilled receivables was  days compared to  days in the prior quarter capital expenditures were  million in the march quarter now i will turn to some additional quarterly financial and operational metrics beginning with those related to our fourth fiscal quarter  revenue revenue across our industry groups were as follows bfsi revenue increased  sequentially representing  of total revenue our bfsi results in the fourth quarter were above our expectations driven by strength in our banking segment including strong growth with our largest client communications and technology revenue increased  sequentially representing  of revenue growth in this vertical was driven primarily by our telecom clients but was below our expectations due to weaker than expected results from our healthcare technology clients media information and other revenue was flat sequential representing the remaining  of revenue mi performance was above our prior expectations during the march quarter we commenced work with five new clients including one in ct and four in bfsi global utilization excluding trainees was  in our fourth quarter up from  in q i would now like to briefly summarize our financial results for the fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  revenue was  million an increase of  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis revenue increased  yearoveryear gaap diluted eps was  compared to  for fiscal year  on an nongaap basis operating profit was  million compared to  million in the prior year and operating margin was  compared with  percent for fiscal year  nongaap net income was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share for fiscal year  before turning to guidance i would like to discuss the orogen investment as we previously announced orogen purchased  shares of our newly issued convertible preferred stock for  million convertible into  million shares of common stock at an conversion price of  we you pay a  dividend per year on the convertible preferred stock which is stable quarterly in cash or additional shares of common stock at our option we used  million of proceeds from the orogen investment to repay a portion of our senior term loan we plan to use part of the remaining  million of proceeds from the orogen investment and cashonhand for common stock repurchases under our recently announced  million repurchase program our current fiscal year  guidance anticipates we will pay cash diminish on the convertible preferred stock by using the methodology as described in our earnings press release we estimate the impact of the convertible preferred stock on our fiscal  diluted earnings per share will a negative  on a gaap basis and then negative  on a nongaap basis while were not factored into our  guidance we expect share purchases made under our buyback program will offset some of the dilution from the convertible preferred shares now i will provide our current guidance for our first quarter and fiscal year ending march   revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  is expected to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal  is expected to be in the range of  to  our q fiscal  nongaap earnings per share guidance anticipates an average share count of approximately  million for the fiscal year ending march   we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million nongaap diluted earnings per share for fiscal year  is expected to be in the range of  to  our guidance excludes  million of stock compensation expense and  million of acquisition related charges full fiscal year  nongaap eps anticipates an average share count of approximately  million our current gaap and nongaap guidance is also based on a set of assumptions that can be found on our data sheet located in the investor relations section of our website now i would like to spend a moment providing you with some additional details regarding our first quarter and fiscal year  guidance for calendar  our clients it budgets appear to be consistent with the prior year offshore budgets are flat to modestly increasing with a reduction in legacy it budgets and a commensurate increase in digital spend average desizing and engagement durations also remain relatively consistent with the prior year from a pricing perspective we are seeing pricing pressure on legacy applications supported maintenance deals brought on predominantly by generationone vendors as they compete more aggressively to offset market share loss to automation our pipeline continues to expand across solution areas with our digital pipeline continue to growing at a healthy rate for example we are seeing some tier  banks in the us increasing their spend on digital solutions by as much as  yearoveryear while some midtier us banks are increasing their digital budgets by as much as  we expect banks with a uk presence to pursue creating new european locations which we believe will drive increased demand and opportunity legislative uncertainties surrounding the healthcare industry have temporary elongated decision making cycles additionally cost pressures leading to corporate restructuring continue to pressure insurance it budgets in all our industry verticals we continue to see demand from our clients for solutions that reduce their bau costs as examples were currently seeing a growing rate of adoptions around robotics and automation in addition large scale enterprise cloud migrations continue to be a major trend as clients look to reduce the cost of running their legacy platforms and applications in fiscal  we expect revenue growth will be supported by growth across all industry groups and geographies we are also expecting growth across our top  and nontop  client portfolios at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range we estimate a  million or  basis points currency headwind our fy  revenue visibility is slightly variable prior years and is based on our current backlog and the assumption that  of revenue will come from existing client portfolio for full fiscal year  as the midpoint of our guidance range we expect to generate approximately  basis points of nongaap operating margin expansion or set out prior expectation of  to  basis points the primary reason for our margin revision is the appreciation of the rupee since we last provided our outlook this resulted in a  impact to our blended inr rate reducing the current margin outlook by  basis points in the first quarter we anticipate our nongaap operating margins will decline approximately  basis points due to a sequential revenue decline seasonal immigration fees and accelerated highly to support q revenue growth however we are anticipating strong yearoveryear revenue and operating margin growth our current guidance anticipates we will record minority interest expense of approximately  million per quarter finally our guidance anticipates no material changes to current visa legislation or corporate tax loss in conclusion we delivered solid revenue and margin growth in the fourth quarter and expect this trend will continue in fiscal year  our top line growth will be driven across all our industry verticals and geographies and our margin expansion will reflect gross margin accretion i will now turn the call over to the operator to begin qa thank you operator can we open it for qa questionandanswer session operator absolutely operator instructions well take our first question comes from joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald joseph foresi hi i was wondering on the margin outlook for next year maybe you could break down the pieces outside of the  basis points of currency what else is combated ph in the margins kris canekeratne joe if you really look at it from our previous discussion that we had of  to  basis points there is really no significant changes other than the big pieces really the  basis points drop on the margin level other than that we are calling for  basis points increase which is primarily coming on the gross margin side we are  there is a little bit of  the one change is going to be that sga you will probably see is a negative leverage primarily because were making a little bit more investments on the digital sm that we had previously contemplated so those are really  two new pieces is inr and more sm investment on the digital side joseph foresi got it and then i think you talked about digital being now  of your revenues versus maybe i think it was  before can you talk about the change in the definition that youre using and whats the margin outlook for that business versus your core business ranjan kalia so let me provide you with some color behind the definition joe so when we first described our digital revenue we only took into consideration our digital specialists we use what we would call a headcount based approach where people were tagged as digital specialist in any of the advanced digital mobile big data cloud etcetera after spending some time with industry analysts to better understand how the industry calculates digital revenue it became very clear to us that the industrial users  what we call a programmatic approach in other words they would  obviously in these digital programs they would have digital specialists and they would have other resources as well java engineers as an example or qa specialist etcetera so in our new methodology we are using a programmatic approach which means that we are using the entire team thats executing against digital work to count towards digital revenue now notwithstanding it is very important for me to share with you that the majority of the operational excellence work we do is in support of endtoend digital program however we are not counting the operational excellence revenue towards digital revenue and so really what weve done here  weve gone from just using headcount that was tagged against  as digital specialists and instead of just using the revenue that attributed to that headcount they are basically using revenue digital revenue to be the programs that were executing that obviously have digital specialists and additional resources that are part of the team joseph foresi got it and then maybe just lastly can you talk about the new outside investment and board member what was the reasoning behind doing that now and what do you think that adds to sort of your organization from a selling standpoint and a financial standpoint going forward thanks kris canekeratne absolutely so we are thrilled that vikram pandit joined our board as you know it wasnt that long ago that we announced the acquisition of polaris we certainly have a significant percentage of our revenue coming from banking and financial services and vikram joining our board we believe is a huge vote of confidence both in terms of two size positioned as well as where we think we can actually take virtusa moving forward ive known vikram for about a year now and we actually meet on a completely separate matter and then i realized that he would be perhaps the best candidate that i could hopefully bring on to our board that came to fruition now were also delighted to have both orogen and atheros ph as longterm investors in virtusa once again we feel that it absolutely validates our position and our strategic direction and we look forward to working with vikram orogen and atheros ph to be able to bring virtusas leading digital transformation and operational excellence practices to their network of enterprises so we are very excited and very enthusiastic to have vikram join our board and we are looking forward to working with orogen and atheros ph based on the longterm investment that they have made joseph foresi thank you ranjan kalia joe you also asked about margin on the digital side for fy number the digital margin portfolio will relatively flat to the company and its expected to show strong accretion from  to  joseph foresi thanks operator thank you our next question comes from anil doradla from william blair anil doradla hey guys couple of questions so i think you guys talked about at  yearoveryear growth in the pipeline in the digital what was the pipeline growth in your nondigital business kris canekeratne so i can give you some specifics around the pipeline anil this is kris by the way the overall pipeline grew approximately  yearoveryear our standard deal pipeline grew by  yearoveryear and our big deal pipeline grew  yearoveryear our digital pipeline grew approximately  yearoveryear win rates and cycle times remain unchanged anil doradla very good okay ranjan kalia anil i just also wanted to add that when we do our revenue profiling for the year we do not include big deal pipeline that was the big learning from last year from q you may remember so later part of last year in  we did not include big deals in fy we do not include big deals in our revenue forecasting anymore anil doradla great so if you look at  bips of margin expansion i think ranjan you talked about gross margin pick up clearly lot of investments in digital now when i look at the utilization in fiscal  should that be ator and above the fiscal  levels or would we see a step down there ranjan kalia so anil it will be because  so we are exiting strong utilization were exiting about  in q our goal would be really to run pretty much at that level maybe a slightly lower for fy by us doing that we will be able to show yearoveryear utilization increase and therefore it will probably add about  to  basis points of margin increasing just from the utilization anil doradla okay and finally if i can squeeze on last one in the top client grew  there is clearly some positive tailwinds on the bfsi sector as we look at  you know can you share some insights on the behavior of the top client in terms of new opportunities in terms of your business there thank you kris canekeratne so anil we are obviously delighted that post the polaris acquisition that our top client continued to rely on us for an increasing volume and percentage of work our teams did a fantastic job i must commend them on executing against citys requirements especially around the spend reduction initiatives that they had but regardless of that we were still able to grow city considerably from the start of the year every single quarter and ending the year on a very good note we expect that those tailwinds will continue and that our largest account will continue to be a growth account for us in fiscal year  anil doradla alright thanks a lot guys operator thank you our next question comes from bryan bergin from cowen bryan bergin hi i wanted to just talk about some of the legacy pricing pressure youre talking about within financial services i heard the good growth in large q banks  digital growth are you seeing a comparable decline on the legacy side of the business kris canekeratne yes so i think let me just provide a bit of additional context before i get to your specific question so i think what we are seeing in the industry is that the days of tremendous amount of pressure on the traditional legacy afm book of business they are all enterprises bfs otherwise are demanding entirely significant reduction in spend on their legacy it outsourcing relationships and partnerships now clearly we do some of that work too but our entire focus has been to help our clients improve the efficacy of their underlying application instead by rationalization consolidation modernization automation etcetera so we feel that we are in a very strong position to actually take some work away from generation one providers where the preponderance of their work using the application support and maintenance pool which is now under pressure in addition to this there is a commensurate investment taking place in terms of digital transformation and clearly virtusa is extremely well positioned to reap the benefits of this dislocation or secular change thats taking place in industry because of our strength around digital transformation how we are positioned and simply stated some of the worlds largest enterprises rely on virtusa for the digital transformation needs bryan bergin okay on the increased investments are there any particular regions or articles that youre focusing on there kris canekeratne i mean generally speaking we are focusing on expanding and investing into our digital capabilities we are seeing very significant demand as our pipeline suggests and we also believe that there is a very strong indication with respect to spend programs in large enterprises around digital so much of our investments are earmarked towards expanding and strengthening our digital capabilities ranjan kalia on the digital as i earlier said not only its the digital sm but actually under digital side were actually going to run even utilization  slightly lower than company because thats really growing very rapidly bryan bergin ok as far as the composition of your pipeline you heard the growth on the digital pipeline  is the percentage of your pipeline within digital similar to what your revenue stream is currently so a third or is it a larger percentage of the pipeline ranjan kalia no the mix are very similar bryan bergin okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from frank atkins from suntrust frank atkins thanks for taking my questions can you give us a little bit more color on some of the increased visa immigration fees and the exposure around visas and just any initiatives that youre looking towards  viewing going forward kris canekeratne yes sure frank so  you know in fact even in q we did have about onethird  million to  million worth of incremental visa fees really related to premium processing that we accelerated in the quarter q and then going forward in q well have the seasonal hb visa filing but that is in terms of the units of hb filings its almost were submitted  lesser than weve done in prior years our mix of local hires continues to increase in our the us citizen green cards eads which in  was about  of the mix and in  it grew to  of the mix in  we are projecting that to go to  of the mix so theres different programs that we are continuing to do in terms of onsite and campus hiring that mix continues to increase for us frank atkins okay and then as we think about digital increasing are you seeing that in the balance of offshore versus onshore mix from clients ranjan kalia look i think we are in the early phase so especially some of the bigger programs that weve started  we talked about a very large deal that we were working on   million deal that one is very significantly onsite centric but there are other programs which are maturing more and they are becoming more balanced but you know there is a little bit of a higher onsite effort on these digital program right now frank atkins okay and last one for me so nice growth in the pipeline for big deals or larger contracts it was one of the strategic kind of rationales for the polaris acquisition can you talk about areas that youre seeing that in or what type of projects are driving that and why do you think youre winning more there kris canekeratne yes so were seeing the large deals on both sides of the equation both in operational excellence as well as digital transformation so operational excellence much of it is targeted basically going in and helping our clients reduce their spend specifically through a niche  such as rationalization consolidation automation modernization etcetera and we are seeing that again the generation one providers we can provide our clients by applying things like rationalization and taking out technical debt we can basically output  to  savings under existing books of business thats in the application support and maintenance so thats obviously creating a strong pipeline of opportunity for us clearly on the digital transformation side we have been selected by some of the largest enterprises who are relying on virtusa for their digital transformation needs and were now starting to see the benefits of that accruing to even other pursuits that they are involved in that we can go after larger deals specifically in digital transformation frank atkins okay great thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from brian kinstlinger from maxim group brian kinstlinger great thanks so much your revenue guidance suggest a sequential decline in june as you mentioned whats driving that reduction i know there is some seasonal weakness at your largest telecom customer but given your acquisition thats a much smaller piece of revenue been years past so maybe highlight some of the reasons that revenue is dropping back a little bit ranjan kalia sure and youre right i mean its a slide at the midpoint if you look at it its about  million decline from q levels and brian really the headwind that recently started seeing more in the last q was really all around healthcare like i said in my prepared remarks the healthcare deal cycle has elongated we do believe its short term in nature in fact you know some of the deals that we were expecting to close in q  well thats one of the real reason why we are slightly lower than our midpoint even in q was around healthcare those deals actually did close in q we are expecting some elongation in q so thats why its slightly lower on q primarily around healthcare brian kinstlinger great and then i asked this last quarter and it was a little too early given the news was too new but have the financial issues at bt  any changes it might have had at management  any impact on your demand trends there for that customer ranjan kalia yes there is a bt this year fy we are forecasting slightly lower than fy performance so we have taken that into account as you know the budgets are getting prepared this quarter but we have tried to take some of those in a public discussions that are in the public forum into our revenue forecasting brian kinstlinger great lastly is virtusa giving its seasonal salary increases  the industry slowed growth changing what those increases are potentially ranjan kalia brian good question i mean we had actually more spread out salary increases in fact in  itself with some of them really were made even in q  q q so we will continue that spreading throughout the quarters versus having a big impact probably in sixteen when that was in the second quarter as we more spread out throughout the year brian kinstlinger great thanks so much operator thank you our next questions comes from vincent colicchio from barrington research vincent colicchio what is the size of the healthcare business today ranjan kalia healthcare in  was about  its expected to grow again in  im sorry the mix was about  it grew  the mix was about  and the mix is expected to stay flat vincent colicchio and kris to what extent will acquisitions be a part of your strategy in the digital area kris canekeratne i mean obviously we are delighted about how effectively weve been able to integrate polaris and the synergies that were seeing and the strength that we have built we continue to leverage the full potential of polaris we still think that there is significant potential ahead of us on the digital side most of our focus is on the organic side investing into building our capabilities further we think we are very well positioned having said that if we want to  if we find a great property that is going to increase our addressable market expand our capabilities we will certainly look at that vincent colicchio okay my other questions are answered thank you operator thank you that concludes todays questionandanswer session id like to pass the call back to kris canekeratne for any closing remarks kris canekeratne thank you thank you all for joining us id like to take this opportunity to thank our global team members their commitment and dedication towards our clients digital transformation programs and our operational excellence program thank you and we look forward to

kris canekeratne chairman  ceo virtusa corp westborough view business leaders of the year   kris canekeratne virtusa corp by an upandcoming generation of consumers that kris canekeratne calls digital natives is changing the types of services large companies feel compelled to offerfor virtusa corp the westboroughbased company canekeratne founded  years ago and now leads as chairman and ceo the trend has meant big businesswe believe and analysts believe that we are just about to embark on the largest application modernization initiative in history canekeratne said in an interview at his companys headquarters nestled in a wooded business park at the intersection of route  and interstate what that means is that an entire generation expects services to be online and mobile and that has meant big business for virtusafor instance in the banking industry internet and mobile are driving the largest change since the automated teller machineeven the smallest banks have felt the pressure to offer online banking services to their customers lest they lose them to banks that can and with many of those customers holding smartphones banks have also had to build apps for mobile bankingjust imagine think back about all the transformation that has taken place for a bank to be able to offer these services to consumers canekeratne saidand though it counts some of the largest banks among its core customers — jp morgan chase was its largest client in its most recent fiscal year — virtusa hasnt limited itself to one sectorthe company builds software platforms for large companies in insurance telecom health care and media too some of its other customers include british telecom — which has operations in nearly  countries —truven health analytics formerly thomson reuters healthcare aetna life insurance co and iron mountain the bostonbased information management firmas an example of how software platforms matter for telecommunications firms canekeratne said its not uncommon for a telecom to have dozens of billing systems built over time as it expands its territoryyou sit back and ask yourself why do you need  selfservice systems or  billing systems he said its not because someone sat down one day and said this is how were going to architect our service delivery its just what happenedimpressive growth if virtusa is on the cusp of a boom in customerfacing it modernization itd be hard to know it by looking at its financialsthe companys revenue — which was  million in fiscal year  has grown substantially over the past eight years it dipped just  percent in the recessionary year of  before rebounding to new highs in  and in the past two years revenue grew  percent and  percent respectively while profits grew  percent and  percentno business is  percent recession proof but large enterprises think long and hard before cutting services to end customers opting to instead trim internal costseven in a recessionary period its probably one of the few areas where they continue to spend canekeratne said and thats boded well for ustalent twofold john gillis a cofounder and executive vice president at virtusa began working with canekeratne in the early s at a company in new york city called insci which built systems to store computer data on optical or magnetic discsmy initial impression is he was obviously a very very talented engineer gillis said but in addition to that he had a level of business acumen that was uncommon in my view from folks that came up on the engineering side of thingsgillis quickly put canekeratne on the customer pursuit team which went out and chased new businessinsci eventually moved to westborough where gillis has a home not long after the two began talking about starting their own companymany tech firms at the time were focused on preparing corporate computer systems for the muchfeared year  date changeover but virtusa founders decided to concentrate on delivering emerging technology through an outsourcing modelinstead of doing things the old way which was really a labor arbitrage play kris had this idea coming from the engineering side that looked at platforming — developing software such that it could be reused he said so you had common functionality at a very low level and then you would have the individual customizations for industry or various clients that would be up on the top levelthomas holler executive vice president and chief strategy officer said that when he first met canekeratne in  he found him inquisitive and energeticbut holler admits he was a bit nervous about joining a pureplay software services company the ones he knew of didnt have scalebut kris convinced me this was a different type of business model and he was right holler saidthe vision canekeratne outlined to holler during those meetings was that the company wanted to reduce it costs for clients help them speed products to market and gives clients customers a better user experiencethat vision while its still relevant today is going to be delivered in a different way tomorrow holler said because the demographics of our clients consumers have dramatically changedvirtusa is a global company with operations in india sri lanka europe the netherlands and singapore but many of its publicly traded competitors are much bigger companies like infosys technologies and cognizant are in the billion to billion range accenture and ibm are far biggervirtusas focus remains on combining multiple separate applications into a software platform on which companies can plan growthwe cant be everything to everyone canekeratne said but when it comes to launching global platforms as opposed to disparate applications we are a tough act to beatvirtusa has a large and geographically diverse workforce but canekeratne said the company works hard to instill several key values in management and workers the company also faces intense competition from other companies looking for skilled it workers he
