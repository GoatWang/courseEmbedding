  company history careers global locations accreditations certifications    please contact customer service in your region for more information or request samples here company history     debell and richardson inc was founded in  when two of the worlds most prominent polymer scientists john debell and henry richardson started the first dedicated plastics research and development firm in the united states located in the hazardville section of enfield connecticut the company rapidly gained a reputation for innovation of engineered compounds and technical service for the growing plastics industry  debell and richardson inc created and patented dozens of plastics commonly in use today     in  then president robert c springborn purchased debell  richardson inc and broadened the scope of the company to include testing analysis and quality assurance the areas of expertise for these endeavors were chemicals and plastics electrical  electronics and consumer merchandise the new expanded company springborn laboratories became a leader in the quality assurance and consumer products testing market while continuing to provide expert plastics research and development services to a variety of internationally known clients     in  springborn laboratories vast knowledge base in polymeric materials was called upon to create the companys most important innovation  the development of encapsulants for terrestrial photovoltaic modules the original pv encapsulant development program having a duration of more than a decade evaluated hundreds of polymeric materials and modifier combinations and included years of advanced weathering studies  the outcome of the program was clear modified ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer eva represented the very best combination of performance and cost easily besting other materials including silicones urethanes acrylics pvbs ionomers etc     in  springborn laboratories began marketing eva for the photovoltaic module industry under the trade name photocap®     in the early s the demand for its photocap® eva became so strong that the company then known as springborn testing and research str decided to make a significant commitment to the expansion of its pilot manufacturing operation investing in productionscale equipment and infrastructure  as a result of the knowledge base acquired through the development of the material in its own laboratories and testing facilities str found its ability to provide technical service to solar startups as much in demand as its encapsulant products     in the early s str with an updated name specialized technology resources inc increased capacity once again and continued its refinement of evabased pv encapsulants launching products with unsurpassed long term photothermal stability faster curing capability and dimensional stability     during the early s str polymer scientists were busy developing still more advanced formulations and product configurations including ultra fast curing encapsulants and multilayer products such as evabacksheet and evacover film     in  str formed the spanish company specialized technology resources españa sa stre in asturias spain to better serve its growing customer base in europe in june of  stre officially commenced production and began planning the addition of its second production line just two months later     str acquired conplex inc in st augustine florida in january of  subsequently converting the company to a dedicated pv encapsulant manufacturing operation and renaming it specialized technology resources florida inc     in  str completed the addition of its second production line at stre and began preparations for a third line there by purchasing the neighboring property commencing a building expansion to double the size of the facility and ordering its largest and most advanced production line to date     in  str launched its fourth factory in somers connecticut usa this factory is dedicated to the production of multilayer constructions for emerging pv applications  the somers facility is the present day location of strs us based solar division     in  str launched its fifth factory specialized technology resources malaysia sdn bhd in gelang patah johor malaysia with the idea of better serving the growing asian pv market     november   str announced that it closed on its previously announced acquisition of land and a  square foot building located in east windsor connecticut str will relocate the majority of its us manufacturing to the new location in addition the facility will house usbased product management and sales teams as well as a new  square foot research and development laboratory the facility acquisition enables str to complete the planned expansion of its connecticut
