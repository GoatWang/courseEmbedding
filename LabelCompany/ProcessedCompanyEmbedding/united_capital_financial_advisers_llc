becomes world’s richest person » talk is cheap automation takes aim at financial advisers—and their fees posted by hkarner   juli  date  source the wall street journal services that use algorithms to generate investment advice deliver it online and charge low fees are pressuring the traditional advisory business automation is threatening one of the most personal businesses in personal finance advice over the past decade financial advisers in brokerage houses and independent firms have amassed trillions in assets helping individuals shape investment portfolios and hammer out financial plans they earn around  of these assets in annual fees a cost advisers say is deserved because they understand clients’ particular situations and can provide assurance when markets fall in the latest test of the reach of technology a new breed of competitors— including betterment llc and wealthfront inc but also initiatives from established firms such as vanguard—is contending even the most personal financial advice can be delivered online over the phone or by videoconferencing with fees as low as zero the goal is to provide goodenough quality at a much lower price “it’s always been questionable whether or not advisers were earning our money at  and up” said paul auslander director of financial planning at provise management group in clearwater fla who says potential clients now compare him with less expensive alternatives „the spread’s got to narrow” the shift has big implications for financial firms that count on advice as a source of stable profits as well as for rivals trying to build new businesses at lower prices it also could mean millions in annual savings for consumers and could expand the overall market for advice competitors across the spectrum agree the demand is there advice “is big and growing—it’s what clients are looking for” said roger hobby executive vice president of private wealth management at fidelity investments the hunger for help marks a shift from the s when doityourself investing was in vogue back then the adoption of k plans moved responsibility for investment choices to company employees just as one of the biggest bull markets in history was boosting individuals’ confidence in their investing prowess meanwhile pioneering online brokerage firms made trading inexpensive and convenient after internet stocks collapsed in  along with the broader stock market eight years later many individuals sought help in the past decade baby boomers started to retire and wanted technical guidance on drawing down their assets the advice industry expanded with the demand besides managing people’s investment portfolios—handling the trades not merely suggesting them—some financial advisers also provide help with budgets or tax and estate planning note based on firms with at least  million in total assets under management assets charted are those for which the firm rather than the client makes investment decisions data for month periods ending march  source securities and exchange commission the number of advisory firms grew to almost  in  up from fewer than  in  according to a wall street journal analysis of securities and exchange commission data this universe of firms handles at least  million in assets each and provides both investment management and financial planning to individuals as of march  such firms collectively had  trillion in assets on which they made investment decisions the journal’s analysis found that is about six times as much as in  throughout this period advice fees have largely held steady—typically  of assets with a potential discount for big accounts one reason the standard held is many clients value aspects of advice that can’t always be measured or easily compared c lansdowne hunt  of burke va said he became more priceconscious after his portfolio fell  in the late stockmarket meltdown so in  he switched to a less expensive adviser and this year asked for a discount on its  fee after being rebuffed mr hunt shopped for a new adviser for his  million portfolio at firms including charles schwab corp td ameritrade inc and edward jones the former naval officer and defensecontractor employee concluded his current virginia advisory firm offers services such as taxsensitive investing and stock picking that might be hard to replicate for a lower cost “i couldn’t get the exact twin” he said many firms are wagering that other customers will take less for less about two years ago vanguard group known for serving doityourselfers started undercutting the financialadviser industry with an annual advice fee of  assets in its service which combines recommendations from computerdriven algorithms with phone video and email consultations with human advisers grew to about  billion in the first year and to  billion by end of last month according to the firm joe mcdonald of titus ala was an early customer long a doityourself investor he decided he needed an adviser after making an illtimed move into an allcash portfolio after barack obama’s  election “i pulled out and stayed in cash until  which was a terrible mistake” said the yearold retired electrical engineer “i found i didn’t really have the discipline to stick with my own plan” he thought about hiring a traditional adviser in florida who charges  of assets under management his wife wasn’t comfortable entrusting money with someone she didn’t know he said mr mcdonald said he first invested in a mutual fund from vanguard in  he liked its  fee on an account with advice and moved his roughly  in retirement accounts there “expenses don’t mean a whole lot if you are making  a year” mr mcdonald said ”but if you are making  or  a year they are a real big deal” at schwab assets handled by financial advisers including those at independent firms that use schwab’s services now account for more than half of the firm’s total assets in recent years the discount brokerage firm has added a range of options for those seeking advice including a “robo” service introduced in  that uses algorithms to build and monitor portfolios at fidelity assets handled with financial advice either from the firm or from independent advisers who use its services have nearly doubled over five years part of the shift is generational as younger adults appear to trust technology more than what they see as salesmanship “kids are saying to their parents ‘why the hell are you paying so much to your adviser is it worth  a year to have somebody to play golf with’ ” said joe duran chief executive of united capital financial advisers llc an investmentmanagement and financialplanning firm that also provides services to advisers independent robo advisers that target younger customers—with fees as low as zero for the smallest accounts—have enjoyed hefty growth betterment and wealthfront say they manage  billion and  billion in assets respectively up from  billion and  billion a year ago morgan stanley  ubs group ag wells fargo  co and bank of americacorp’s merrill lynch known for providing fullfrills service at top rates are testing or have already launched automatedadvice ventures that charge less than their standard fees the goal is to keep feeconscious and lowerbalance customers some dealmakers are buying up traditional financial advisers with an eye toward consolidating and cutting costs saying the industry has too many firms with outmoded technology and high overhead the first half of  was the most active yet for mergers and acquisitions among financial advisers according to consulting and investmentbanking firm devoe  co the myriad pressures have traditional financial advisers investing in timesaving technology to cut costs some are passing along part of the savings to clients through fee reductions while others are adding services to justify maintaining their fees according to a survey from research firm cerulli associates  of executives at advisory firms expect their fees to fall within the next five years ann gugle a principal at alpha financial advisors in charlotte nc said her firm recently cut its annual fee on assets of over  million to  from  “if you do the math you realize your practice will be worth significantly more if you’re smart about aligning your pricing with the value you deliver” said ms gugle “if not you’re going to be mincemeat” robert schmansky a solo practitioner in livonia mich dropped his advisory fee to  from  earlier this year until recently mr schmansky said he has mainly marketed himself as a fiduciary—someone committed to working in the client’s best interests now he finds himself in direct competition with vanguard schwab and others that also call themselves fiduciaries “my key marketing distinction is being eroded by these firms in some ways” he said he works with a lot of younger investors and “when i tell them my fee is  they know immediately that betterment costs less” of all the initiatives vanguard’s is widely cited as the most threatening to the status quo the firm’s size brand recognition and aggressive pricing will create a challenge unlike anything independent advisers have seen before said michael kitces director of wealth management at pinnacle advisory group inc in columbia md—much as vanguard’s index funds have wreaked havoc on the traditional mutualfund business vanguard’s personal advisor services minimum investment  has gained traction because customers want it said karin risi head of the firm’s retail investor group “they didn’t just want to invest in a fund with us—they were saying they needed more help” so far only about  of assets in the program comes from clients new to the firm advisers and industry analysts say it is only a matter of time before the service starts poaching more clients from competitors vanguard has devoted about  financial advisers to its venture said ms risi she expects the firm to hire roughly  advisers annually for the next several years clients with more than  get a dedicated adviser who is a certified financial planner those with less interact with rotating advisers drawn from a pool some not yet cfps many traditional advisers suggest that partially automated services such as vanguard’s provide basic cookiecutter advice inferior to what an experienced financial planner can provide ms risi said the firm’s advisers go through “pretty impressive training” elyse foster an adviser in boulder colo has taken note three years ago she cut financialplanning fees by an average of  at her firm harbor financial group inc it also has invested in technology that allows clients to open accounts online automatically rebalances portfolios to a target mix of stocks and bonds and shares software so clients can simulate their own planning scenarios “we are aware consumers are more priceconscious and are lowering our fees proactively” said ms foster “we are trying to stay ahead of the industry”
