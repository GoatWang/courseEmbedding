source of efficient and technologybased production helping them diversify their portfolio while getting access to a wide suite of commercial debt products what types of investments does realtymogulcom offer on realtymogulcom you can invest in two primary investment types loans debt or equity real estate loans debt in this investment type investors purchase a specific loan or a pool of loans the underlying loan is tied to a residential or commercial property and the loan is secured by the property until the borrower repays the loan in full investors earn monthly interest on their money typically with a balloon payment at the end hold periods for the loans could be as short as a few months and as long as a few years equity investments in this investment type we focus on equity investments with existing cashflow like apartment buildings office buildings retail shopping centers and selfstorage facilities with this type of investment investors pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific property or a pool of properties the investment is acquired and managed by a professional real estate investment company also known as a “sponsor” with a track record of acquiring and managing real estate investors are typically entitled to a share of the cashflow from rents as well as a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold the hold period for an investment like this may range from  years how does an investment opportunity get listed on realtymogulcom real estate companies or individuals list their investment opportunities in the realtymogulcom marketplace only after joining realtymogulcom submitting an application and going through an underwriting and due diligence process for equity investments the realtymogulcom underwriting team along with our brokerdealer partner north capital reviews their materials and determines whether the company and the investment is a good fit for our members we go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including return structure market statistics quality of the property and the track record reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with this process also includes background criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud finally we always tour the property as a final step before it is listed we reject many equity transactions that are proposed to us keeping in mind one of our core values  investor protection at realtymogulcom we look for transactions that provide cash flow to investors as quickly as possible some properties may have some level of vacancy or have the ability for our operating partner to add value and increase cash flow over the life of the investment we do not currently fund groundup development as we believe one of the benefits of real estate investing is passive income and development projects typically take  months to generate income we do fund apartment buildings selfstorage facilities hotels mobile home parks office and multitenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers for debt investments realtymogulcom provides loans for commercial properties including apartment buildings selfstorage facilities mobile home parks office and multitenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers we examine many variables when evaluating debt investment opportunities for loans on commercial properties we evaluate metrics including debt service coverage ratios loantovalue ratios and debt yields regardless of loan type we look for borrowers with a successful track record and make sure they undergo background and credit checks so we can ensure financial competence and responsibility the liens associated with our debt are frequently “senior” or in “first position” so in the event of a borrower default our investors have first claim to the proceeds in the event of a foreclosure most of these loans are shortterm ranging from  months before principal is repaid we may from time to time offer debt in the second position mezzanine debt which is subordinate to our more frequent offering of senior debt investors are always made aware of the debt position prior to making an investment decision are the investments secure although no investment is guaranteed one benefit of investing with realtymogulcom is that you are investing in physical assets around the united states your investment is in an actual property as opposed to a stock or bond or other nonphysical asset are these investments risky yes similar to investing in the stock market there is no guarantee when you are investing in real estate the real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change does realtymogulcom do background or credit checks when new investors register with the site yes our brokerdealer north capital runs kyc know your customer and antimoney laundering on all who invest in deals on our site additionally on some offerings where advertising may have been used some additional verification of an investor’s status as an accredited investor may be required is there an investment minimum yes the minimum investment is different for each investment but can be as low as  are there fees for investors joining realtymogulcom and browsing the marketplace requires no obligation for those who choose to invest there are fees associated with each investment the fees depend on the type of investment loan purchase or equity purchase and the nature of the transaction in addition to administrative and legal expenses the fees will cover the ongoing reporting and communications for the investments as we are big believers in transparency you can find the specific fee structure for each deal when you browse through our investment opportunities how does the investment process work an investment is not final until all legal documents are signed and funding has been contributed and cleared when an investor makes their investment the money is held securely at a us bank once the fundraising target is met and the real estate transaction is completed the money is transferred for the sole purpose of the specific loan or specific property that is being invested in how do investors transfer funds to realtymogulcom standard ach transfer can be made from an investor’s bank account for amounts up to  amounts larger than  are made using a wire transfer for each investment opportunity there will be specific account numbers that we will provide to the investor so that funds are properly received on our end how are legal documents handled on realtymogulcom all legal documents can be sent and signed electronically through our website this allows for more efficient and seamless transfer of documents between you and realtymogulcom while maintaining the authenticity and security of your information investments are finalized once proper legal documentation is accepted funds are confirmed received and we provide you with completed counterpart signatures can i use an sdira or other type of ira for my investment and cash flow distributions at this time we can and regularly do process debt investments made through a selfdirected ira account but it will depend on your custodians processesprocedures our two requirements are that the custodian be able to process documents via electronic signatures and that it be able to process contributions and distributions via ach transfer payments unfortunately some custodians have problems meeting these conditions inquire of your current custodian whether they can work with these requirements and if not we can refer you over to other providers who can meet these guidelines how will investors be updated about their investment status investors will be able to view real time updates of their investments when they login to the site and view their investor dashboard this is their hub of information and will provide comprehensive metrics about their distributions to date upcoming milestones and overall return on investment additional emails are sent out when distributions are sent to your bank account once invested how do investors get regular updates about their investments realtymogulcom will work with the real estate company to provide timely updates shared with all investors at least quarterly updates will be provided via email and via the investor dashboard in addition investors will receive tax documents every year that they have a distribution from a real estate investment on realtymogulcom how will my investment cash flow allocations be distributed investors who invest in debt typically receive interest payments on a monthly basis while investors who invest in equity typically receive quarterly distributions usually we will send the cash flow income to the same bank account that the investor provided for their original investment though we can accommodate changing a distribution bank account by request we ask for bank information that will allow for monthly or quarterly standard ach transfers distributions are never guaranteed in amount or timing and you should carefully read the offering documents on the specific deal you are interested in to fully understand how projected distributions look like and what risks are involved is my investment liquid no the real estate investments found on realtymogulcom are private transactions in physical properties around the united states the investments are not traded on public stock exchanges and cannot be easily sold or traded you may be able to resell your investment security in a private transaction subject to restrictions that are specific to each investment and under the securities act of  since the resale restrictions on realtymogulcom can be very limiting you should not invest with the expectation of reselling your investment when will i get my investment back different properties have different expected hold periods a hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is resold or the loan on it is paid off it is important to read the offering documents for each investment opportunity for a deeper understanding of the hold period for each investment i see the name north capital on your website who is north capital north capital is realtymogulcom’s brokerdealer partner who provides compliance and regulatory oversight to realtymogulcom what happens if realtymogulcom goes out of business in the event of a corporate bankruptcy there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide however we would work to put replacement servicers in place for all realtymogulcom transactions invest in equity what types of properties are available through equity investments realtymogulcom offers access to a variety of property types including but not limited to multifamily office industrial selfstorage retail medical office and hospitality how are equity investments structured investors are typically purchasing shares in a realty mogul limited liability company “llc” that in turn invests into an llc or limited partnership “lp” that holds title to the real property when i invest in equity investments on realtymogulcom what do i own when you invest in an equity opportunity you are typically purchasing shares of an llc as a limited member in turn that llc owns directly or indirectly along with the sponsor and other investors a share of a joint venture entity that owns a specific investment property like a specific apartment building an llc gives you liability protection shielding your personal assets from the investment why do investors invest into a realty mogul llc instead of directly into the company that holds title to the real property by investing into a realty mogul llc it minimizes overhead for the sponsors who work with realtymogulcom and allows us to access more investment opportunities for investors it also allows for streamlined reporting distributions and tax documentation through the realtymogulcom platform who makes decisions in an llc decisions in an llc are governed by a document called an “operating agreement” while every operating agreement is slightly different they usually include a manager who may also be a member and limited members the manager typically makes all of the daytoday decisions and the limited members act as passive investors on the transaction the manager can determine how much cash to distribute to the limited members versus how much to hold in reserve and assess possible sales for the property there are certain activities that might mandate a vote by the limited members and the limited members can typically take action if the managing member defaults on the terms of the agreement or is grossly negligent who makes decisions in the realty mogul llc that investors contribute to rm manager llc a wholly owned subsidiary of realtymogulcom is typically the managing member of realty mogul llcs rm manager is an exempt reporting advisor rm manager does not own a piece of the realty mogul llcs but is responsible for certain limited decision making however you will need to review the specific offering materials for each investment to fully understand the structure and the duties of all entities involved how often should distributions be expected distributions depend on the specific investment but are typically provided to equity investors each quarter please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment no distributions are guaranteed what if i invested in equity and more money is needed for the property in the future am i obligated to invest more as an equity owner realtymogulcom investments typically do not have capital calls a capital call is where the investor is required to commit more money to the property beyond the initial investment rather than requiring an additional investment it is possible that investors will be diluted if more money needs to be raised while this is typically the case with equity investments offered on realtymogulcom please check the offering materials for each investment to fully understand your liabilities as an investor what are the tax implications of investing in equity opportunities with realtymogulcom one of the benefits of investing in real estate equity through limited liability companies llcs is that llcs can be treated as partnerships for tax purposes partnerships generally are not taxed at the entity level other than annual franchise taxes and filing fees and can “pass through” applicable items of income loss and depreciation to their members noncash depreciation deductions can shelter or eliminate the amount taxable income that may be otherwise passed through to an investor from a real estate equity investment particularly in the early stages of the investment as a result cash distributions received by an investor in a year when there is no corresponding passthrough of taxable income again due to depreciation deductions may result in lower or deferred taxes the special purpose entity a realty mogul llc you own when you invest in an equity transaction reports your annual share of income and loss and distributions on federal and state ks that you can then use to prepare your tax return while the special purpose entities the realty mogul llcs that are formed for each equity transaction typically are delaware entities there may be filing requirements and tax liabilities in other states depending on the details of a particular transaction your state of residence and the location of the investment property realty mogul co and its affiliates do not provide tax legal or accounting advice this material has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for tax legal or accounting advice you should consult your own tax legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction see offering documents for additional details disclosures and disclaimers invest in debt what types of loandebt investments can investors make when investing in loans investors will either acquire a borrower payment dependent promissory note a “platform note” from realty mogul co or purchase a whole loan when i invest in a platform note on realtymogulcom what do i own when you invest in a platform note you are purchasing an unsecured note in realty mogul co the performance of which is tied to the underlying real estate loan this platform note allows you to receive periodic payments on the loan if and when the borrower on the underlying real estate loan makes interest payments are platform notes secured by real estate no the platform notes are not secured by real estate when investing in platform notes if a loan defaults is there any obligation to invest more no an investor will not need to fund additional amounts once the initial investment has been made who is eligible to buy whole loans institutional investors looking to invest  million are eligible to buy whole loans from realtymogulcom these whole loans differ from the platform notes in that they are secured by real estate when investing in whole loans if a loan defaults is there any obligation to invest more yes an investor will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default when purchasing whole loans if a borrower stops paying what happens if a borrower stops paying we will determine what loan modification or loss mitigation options to pursue before beginning foreclosure proceedings realtymogulcom will inform all investors if any significant actions are taken on their specific loan investments how often should distributions be expected distributions depend on the specific investment but are typically provided to debt investors each month please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment no distributions are guaranteed what are the tax implications of investing in debt opportunities with realtymogulcom tax information regarding first lien debt investments is reported annually to investors on form  for other types of debt like mezzanine debt distributions may be characterized as interest dividends or other distributions and investors may receive either a form  or a federal and state form k depending on the structure of the transaction realty mogul co and its affiliates do not provide tax legal or accounting advice this material has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for tax legal or accounting advice you should consult your own tax legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction see offering documents for additional details disclosures and disclaimers invest in mogulreit what is mogulreit i mogulreit i is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments such as loans equity in commercial real estate ventures and other real estaterelated assets mogulreit i is a registered nontraded reit that means that it is registered with the securities and exchange commission but is not traded on a stock exchange  what types of properties or investments go into mogulreit i mogulreit i can invest in a variety of property types including but not limited to multifamily office industrial selfstorage and retail real estate opportunities mogulreit i can invest in various commercial real estaterelated equity and debt assets across these different property types who can invest in mogulreit i mogulreit i is available to both accredited and nonaccredited investors for nonaccredited investors limitations based on the investor’s annual income or net worth apply to the amount that may be invested what is the minimum amount i can invest in mogulreit i for most investors the minimum investment is  and investors may invest additional capital in increments of  for selfdirected ira “sdira” investors the minimum investment is  and  thereafter for a registered investment advisor “ria” account the minimum investment is  for the first transaction and  thereafter how liquid is an investment in mogulreit i redemptions from the fund are generally allowed on a quarterly basis subject to the redemptions rights and limitations outlined in the offering circular how is investing in mogulreit i different from other investment opportunities offered on the realtymogulcom platform the realtymogulcom platform currently offers individual real propertyrelated investments as private placements to accredited investors only the realtymogulcom platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time investing in mogulreit i is different since investment decisions are made by its manager rm adviser llc and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property additionally mogulreit i is accessible to both accredited and nonaccredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the realtymogulcom platform rm adviser llc charges a  asset management fee for managing mogulreit i and its investments whereas the other investment opportunities offered through the realtymogulcom platform may charge fees that are higher or lower finally mogulreit i is set up as a “blind pool” reit which means that it is not committed to acquiring any particular investments with the net proceeds of its offering investing in mogulreit i can lead to greater diversification because mogulreit i intends to invest its assets in multiple real estate opportunities however unlike other investments on the realtymogulcom platform a purchaser of common shares in mogulreit i may not know what investments mogulreit i will make with its assets at the time the investor purchases common shares in mogulreit i who is on the manager team of mogulreit mogulreit i is managed by rm adviser llc a sec registered investment adviser and whollyowned subsidiary of realty mogul co rm adviser which manages mogulreit i’s daytoday operations will have access to the experienced team of real estate finance professionals employed by realty mogul co including jilliene helman its chief executive officer many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at realty mogul have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years collectively these professionals have approximately  years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business and have managed more than  billion of originations and more than  billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments mogulreit i expects to benefit from the knowledge and industry contacts experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles the credit team of realty mogul and its affiliates is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments this team has substantial experience in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments and has adopted approaches used by real estate finance industry leaders in its analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies and these approaches will be brought to bear for mogulreit i’s benefit what services will the manager perform the manager performs the following services investment advisory and acquisition services including performing due diligence on mogulreit i’s investments offering services asset management services accounting and other administrative services shareholder services financing services and disposition services how does realtymogulcom decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t mogulreit i pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its offering circular some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either mogulreit i or the realtymogulcom platform in these instances any potential debt investment exceeding  and equity investment exceeding  will first be made available to mogulreit i if mogulreit i chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for realty mogul then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the realtymogulcom platform mogulreit i may where the investment committee of its manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the reit permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the realtymogulcom platform invest in  what is a  exchange a  exchange is a strategy for deferring the capital gains tax from the sale of a property by exchanging a relinquished property for likekind real estate owners may be able to defer their federal taxes and use the proceeds for the purchase of replacement property what is “likekind property” generally any form of property held for business or investment purposes qualifies including apartment buildings singlefamily rentals vacant land office buildings selfstorage facilities shopping centers and hotels these property types may be  eligible properties what does it mean to be “ eligible” not all real estate investments are eligible for  exchanges in order for your investment in real property to be  eligible you must have a direct ownership in the underlying real estate debt investments aren’t eligible because they are interests in a promissory note not the underlying real estate similarly partnership interests including llc’s where an investor owns a share of a partnership interest instead of a share of the underlying real estate would be ineligible however per the irs’s revenue ruling  ownership of a beneficiary interest in a delaware statutory trust does qualify to be part of an investor’s  exchange what is a delaware statutory trust property commonly known as “dst” this entity is often used to hold title to real estate similar to an llc instead of owning a membership interest in an llc a dst investor owns a beneficial interest in the dst also like an llc the entity shields the investor from individual liability however unlike an llc a dst  property will qualify as a “like kind” exchange replacement property for a  exchange per internal revenue ruling  what are the downsides of investing in a dst the dst is typically managed by the dst trustee and the beneficial owners do not have voting right like they would typically have in an llc instead the dst and therefore the real property investments held by the dst are managed by the trustee not the investors themselves additionally the irs established seven prohibitions over the powers of the dst trustee which includes the following once the offering is closed there can be no future equity contribution to the dst by either current or new coinvestors or beneficiaries the dst trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans nor can it borrow any new funds from any other lender or party the dst trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its investment real estate the dst trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property to those for a normal repair and maintenance b minor nonstructural capital improvements and c those required by law any liquid cash held in the dst between distribution dates can only be invested in shortterm debt obligations all cash other than necessary reserves must be distributed to the coinvestors or beneficiaries on a current basis and the trustee cannot enter into new leases or renegotiate the current leases what is a springing llc dst agreements often contain a provision that allows the trustee to convert the dst to an llc the “springing llc” if the trustee determines that the dst is in danger of losing the property due to its inability to act because of the prohibitions in the trust agreement the conversion to an llc will allow the trustee who becomes the manager of the llc to raise additional funds renegotiate terms of existing debt and enter into new leases however because a membership interest in a springing llc is not a  eligible the members investors lose their ability to defer capital gains upon the sale of the property owned by the llc through another  exchange what are the basic requirements to complete a  exchange the following is a list of the basic elements involved in typical  exchanges a qualified intermediary sometimes referred to as a “ accommodator” is used to exchange the funds from the real estate that is sold to the real estate that is purchased investors identify their replacement properties typically  properties with their  accommodator within  days of sale of the initial property investors reinvest  of the net sales proceeds from the initial property sale into their replacement properties investors acquire an equal or greater amount of debt on the replacement properties than they had on their initial properties investors close on the purchase of the replacement properties within  days of the sale of their initial property  exchanges can be very complicated and you should consult with your cpa and attorney before proceeding with an exchange can i invest if i do not currently own a  eligible property yes “cash investors” are investors who use non money to invest in a  eligible deal once they have completed their investment those investment funds become  eligible and can be used as part of a  exchange in the future sponsor – raise equity what is the process to raise equity through

one place on your investor dashboard for institutional investors we are a source of efficient and technologybased production helping them diversify their portfolio while getting access to a wide suite of commercial debt products what types of investments does realtymogulcom offer on realtymogulcom you can invest in two primary investment types loans debt or equity real estate loans debt in this investment type investors purchase a specific loan or a pool of loans the underlying loan is tied to a residential or commercial property and the loan is secured by the property until the borrower repays the loan in full investors earn monthly interest on their money typically with a balloon payment at the end hold periods for the loans could be as short as a few months and as long as a few years equity investments in this investment type we focus on equity investments with existing cashflow like apartment buildings office buildings retail shopping centers and selfstorage facilities with this type of investment investors pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific property or a pool of properties the investment is acquired and managed by a professional real estate investment company also known as a “sponsor” with a track record of acquiring and managing real estate investors are typically entitled to a share of the cashflow from rents as well as a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold the hold period for an investment like this may range from  years how does an investment opportunity get listed on realtymogulcom real estate companies or individuals list their investment opportunities in the realtymogulcom marketplace only after joining realtymogulcom submitting an application and going through an underwriting and due diligence process for equity investments the realtymogulcom underwriting team along with our brokerdealer partner north capital reviews their materials and determines whether the company and the investment is a good fit for our members we go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including return structure market statistics quality of the property and the track record reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with this process also includes background criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud finally we always tour the property as a final step before it is listed we reject many equity transactions that are proposed to us keeping in mind one of our core values  investor protection at realtymogulcom we look for transactions that provide cash flow to investors as quickly as possible some properties may have some level of vacancy or have the ability for our operating partner to add value and increase cash flow over the life of the investment we do not currently fund groundup development as we believe one of the benefits of real estate investing is passive income and development projects typically take  months to generate income we do fund apartment buildings selfstorage facilities hotels mobile home parks office and multitenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers for debt investments realtymogulcom provides loans for commercial properties including apartment buildings selfstorage facilities mobile home parks office and multitenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers we examine many variables when evaluating debt investment opportunities for loans on commercial properties we evaluate metrics including debt service coverage ratios loantovalue ratios and debt yields regardless of loan type we look for borrowers with a successful track record and make sure they undergo background and credit checks so we can ensure financial competence and responsibility the liens associated with our debt are frequently “senior” or in “first position” so in the event of a borrower default our investors have first claim to the proceeds in the event of a foreclosure most of these loans are shortterm ranging from  months before principal is repaid we may from time to time offer debt in the second position mezzanine debt which is subordinate to our more frequent offering of senior debt investors are always made aware of the debt position prior to making an investment decision are the investments secure although no investment is guaranteed one benefit of investing with realtymogulcom is that you are investing in physical assets around the united states your investment is in an actual property as opposed to a stock or bond or other nonphysical asset are these investments risky yes similar to investing in the stock market there is no guarantee when you are investing in real estate the real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change does realtymogulcom do background or credit checks when new investors register with the site yes our brokerdealer north capital runs kyc know your customer and antimoney laundering on all who invest in deals on our site additionally on some offerings where advertising may have been used some additional verification of an investor’s status as an accredited investor may be required is there an investment minimum yes the minimum investment is different for each investment but can be as low as  are there fees for investors joining realtymogulcom and browsing the marketplace requires no obligation for those who choose to invest there are fees associated with each investment the fees depend on the type of investment loan purchase or equity purchase and the nature of the transaction in addition to administrative and legal expenses the fees will cover the ongoing reporting and communications for the investments as we are big believers in transparency you can find the specific fee structure for each deal when you browse through our investment opportunities how does the investment process work an investment is not final until all legal documents are signed and funding has been contributed and cleared when an investor makes their investment the money is held securely at a us bank once the fundraising target is met and the real estate transaction is completed the money is transferred for the sole purpose of the specific loan or specific property that is being invested in how do investors transfer funds to realtymogulcom standard ach transfer can be made from an investor’s bank account for amounts up to  amounts larger than  are made using a wire transfer for each investment opportunity there will be specific account numbers that we will provide to the investor so that funds are properly received on our end how are legal documents handled on realtymogulcom all legal documents can be sent and signed electronically through our website this allows for more efficient and seamless transfer of documents between you and realtymogulcom while maintaining the authenticity and security of your information investments are finalized once proper legal documentation is accepted funds are confirmed received and we provide you with completed counterpart signatures can i use an sdira or other type of ira for my investment and cash flow distributions at this time we can and regularly do process debt investments made through a selfdirected ira account but it will depend on your custodians processesprocedures our two requirements are that the custodian be able to process documents via electronic signatures and that it be able to process contributions and distributions via ach transfer payments unfortunately some custodians have problems meeting these conditions inquire of your current custodian whether they can work with these requirements and if not we can refer you over to other providers who can meet these guidelines how will investors be updated about their investment status investors will be able to view real time updates of their investments when they login to the site and view their investor dashboard this is their hub of information and will provide comprehensive metrics about their distributions to date upcoming milestones and overall return on investment additional emails are sent out when distributions are sent to your bank account once invested how do investors get regular updates about their investments realtymogulcom will work with the real estate company to provide timely updates shared with all investors at least quarterly updates will be provided via email and via the investor dashboard in addition investors will receive tax documents every year that they have a distribution from a real estate investment on realtymogulcom how will my investment cash flow allocations be distributed investors who invest in debt typically receive interest payments on a monthly basis while investors who invest in equity typically receive quarterly distributions usually we will send the cash flow income to the same bank account that the investor provided for their original investment though we can accommodate changing a distribution bank account by request we ask for bank information that will allow for monthly or quarterly standard ach transfers distributions are never guaranteed in amount or timing and you should carefully read the offering documents on the specific deal you are interested in to fully understand how projected distributions look like and what risks are involved is my investment liquid no the real estate investments found on realtymogulcom are private transactions in physical properties around the united states the investments are not traded on public stock exchanges and cannot be easily sold or traded you may be able to resell your investment security in a private transaction subject to restrictions that are specific to each investment and under the securities act of  since the resale restrictions on realtymogulcom can be very limiting you should not invest with the expectation of reselling your investment when will i get my investment back different properties have different expected hold periods a hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is resold or the loan on it is paid off it is important to read the offering documents for each investment opportunity for a deeper understanding of the hold period for each investment i see the name north capital on your website who is north capital north capital is realtymogulcom’s brokerdealer partner who provides compliance and regulatory oversight to realtymogulcom what happens if realtymogulcom goes out of business in the event of a corporate bankruptcy there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide however we would work to put replacement servicers in place for all realtymogulcom transactions invest in equity what types of properties are available through equity investments realtymogulcom offers access to a variety of property types including but not limited to multifamily office industrial selfstorage retail medical office and hospitality how are equity investments structured investors are typically purchasing shares in a realty mogul limited liability company “llc” that in turn invests into an llc or limited partnership “lp” that holds title to the real property when i invest in equity investments on realtymogulcom what do i own when you invest in an equity opportunity you are typically purchasing shares of an llc as a limited member in turn that llc owns directly or indirectly along with the sponsor and other investors a share of a joint venture entity that owns a specific investment property like a specific apartment building an llc gives you liability protection shielding your personal assets from the investment why do investors invest into a realty mogul llc instead of directly into the company that holds title to the real property by investing into a realty mogul llc it minimizes overhead for the sponsors who work with realtymogulcom and allows us to access more investment opportunities for investors it also allows for streamlined reporting distributions and tax documentation through the realtymogulcom platform who makes decisions in an llc decisions in an llc are governed by a document called an “operating agreement” while every operating agreement is slightly different they usually include a manager who may also be a member and limited members the manager typically makes all of the daytoday decisions and the limited members act as passive investors on the transaction the manager can determine how much cash to distribute to the limited members versus how much to hold in reserve and assess possible sales for the property there are certain activities that might mandate a vote by the limited members and the limited members can typically take action if the managing member defaults on the terms of the agreement or is grossly negligent who makes decisions in the realty mogul llc that investors contribute to rm manager llc a wholly owned subsidiary of realtymogulcom is typically the managing member of realty mogul llcs rm manager is an exempt reporting advisor rm manager does not own a piece of the realty mogul llcs but is responsible for certain limited decision making however you will need to review the specific offering materials for each investment to fully understand the structure and the duties of all entities involved how often should distributions be expected distributions depend on the specific investment but are typically provided to equity investors each quarter please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment no distributions are guaranteed what if i invested in equity and more money is needed for the property in the future am i obligated to invest more as an equity owner realtymogulcom investments typically do not have capital calls a capital call is where the investor is required to commit more money to the property beyond the initial investment rather than requiring an additional investment it is possible that investors will be diluted if more money needs to be raised while this is typically the case with equity investments offered on realtymogulcom please check the offering materials for each investment to fully understand your liabilities as an investor what are the tax implications of investing in equity opportunities with realtymogulcom one of the benefits of investing in real estate equity through limited liability companies llcs is that llcs can be treated as partnerships for tax purposes partnerships generally are not taxed at the entity level other than annual franchise taxes and filing fees and can “pass through” applicable items of income loss and depreciation to their members noncash depreciation deductions can shelter or eliminate the amount taxable income that may be otherwise passed through to an investor from a real estate equity investment particularly in the early stages of the investment as a result cash distributions received by an investor in a year when there is no corresponding passthrough of taxable income again due to depreciation deductions may result in lower or deferred taxes the special purpose entity a realty mogul llc you own when you invest in an equity transaction reports your annual share of income and loss and distributions on federal and state ks that you can then use to prepare your tax return while the special purpose entities the realty mogul llcs that are formed for each equity transaction typically are delaware entities there may be filing requirements and tax liabilities in other states depending on the details of a particular transaction your state of residence and the location of the investment property realty mogul co and its affiliates do not provide tax legal or accounting advice this material has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for tax legal or accounting advice you should consult your own tax legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction see offering documents for additional details disclosures and disclaimers invest in debt what types of loandebt investments can investors make when investing in loans investors will either acquire a borrower payment dependent promissory note a “platform note” from realty mogul co or purchase a whole loan when i invest in a platform note on realtymogulcom what do i own when you invest in a platform note you are purchasing an unsecured note in realty mogul co the performance of which is tied to the underlying real estate loan this platform note allows you to receive periodic payments on the loan if and when the borrower on the underlying real estate loan makes interest payments are platform notes secured by real estate no the platform notes are not secured by real estate when investing in platform notes if a loan defaults is there any obligation to invest more no an investor will not need to fund additional amounts once the initial investment has been made who is eligible to buy whole loans institutional investors looking to invest  million are eligible to buy whole loans from realtymogulcom these whole loans differ from the platform notes in that they are secured by real estate when investing in whole loans if a loan defaults is there any obligation to invest more yes an investor will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default when purchasing whole loans if a borrower stops paying what happens if a borrower stops paying we will determine what loan modification or loss mitigation options to pursue before beginning foreclosure proceedings realtymogulcom will inform all investors if any significant actions are taken on their specific loan investments how often should distributions be expected distributions depend on the specific investment but are typically provided to debt investors each month please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment no distributions are guaranteed what are the tax implications of investing in debt opportunities with realtymogulcom tax information regarding first lien debt investments is reported annually to investors on form  for other types of debt like mezzanine debt distributions may be characterized as interest dividends or other distributions and investors may receive either a form  or a federal and state form k depending on the structure of the transaction realty mogul co and its affiliates do not provide tax legal or accounting advice this material has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for tax legal or accounting advice you should consult your own tax legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction see offering documents for additional details disclosures and disclaimers invest in mogulreit what is mogulreit i mogulreit i is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments such as loans equity in commercial real estate ventures and other real estaterelated assets mogulreit i is a registered nontraded reit that means that it is registered with the securities and exchange commission but is not traded on a stock exchange  what types of properties or investments go into mogulreit i mogulreit i can invest in a variety of property types including but not limited to multifamily office industrial selfstorage and retail real estate opportunities mogulreit i can invest in various commercial real estaterelated equity and debt assets across these different property types who can invest in mogulreit i mogulreit i is available to both accredited and nonaccredited investors for nonaccredited investors limitations based on the investor’s annual income or net worth apply to the amount that may be invested what is the minimum amount i can invest in mogulreit i for most investors the minimum investment is  and investors may invest additional capital in increments of  for selfdirected ira “sdira” investors the minimum investment is  and  thereafter for a registered investment advisor “ria” account the minimum investment is  for the first transaction and  thereafter how liquid is an investment in mogulreit i redemptions from the fund are generally allowed on a quarterly basis subject to the redemptions rights and limitations outlined in the offering circular how is investing in mogulreit i different from other investment opportunities offered on the realtymogulcom platform the realtymogulcom platform currently offers individual real propertyrelated investments as private placements to accredited investors only the realtymogulcom platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time investing in mogulreit i is different since investment decisions are made by its manager rm adviser llc and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property additionally mogulreit i is accessible to both accredited and nonaccredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the realtymogulcom platform rm adviser llc charges a  asset management fee for managing mogulreit i and its investments whereas the other investment opportunities offered through the realtymogulcom platform may charge fees that are higher or lower finally mogulreit i is set up as a “blind pool” reit which means that it is not committed to acquiring any particular investments with the net proceeds of its offering investing in mogulreit i can lead to greater diversification because mogulreit i intends to invest its assets in multiple real estate opportunities however unlike other investments on the realtymogulcom platform a purchaser of common shares in mogulreit i may not know what investments mogulreit i will make with its assets at the time the investor purchases common shares in mogulreit i who is on the manager team of mogulreit mogulreit i is managed by rm adviser llc a sec registered investment adviser and whollyowned subsidiary of realty mogul co rm adviser which manages mogulreit i’s daytoday operations will have access to the experienced team of real estate finance professionals employed by realty mogul co including jilliene helman its chief executive officer many of the senior executives and loan origination

professionals have approximately  years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business and have managed more than  billion of originations and more than  billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments mogulreit i expects to benefit from the knowledge and industry contacts experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles the credit team of realty mogul and its affiliates is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments this team has substantial experience in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments and has adopted approaches used by real estate finance industry leaders in its analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies and these approaches will be brought to bear for mogulreit i’s benefit what services will the manager perform the manager performs the following services investment advisory and acquisition services including performing due diligence on mogulreit i’s investments offering services asset management services accounting and other administrative services shareholder services financing services and disposition services how does realtymogulcom decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t mogulreit i pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its offering circular some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either mogulreit i or the realtymogulcom platform in these instances any potential debt investment exceeding  and equity investment exceeding  will first be made available to mogulreit i if mogulreit i chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for realty mogul then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the realtymogulcom platform mogulreit i may where the investment committee of its manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the reit permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the realtymogulcom platform invest in  what is a  exchange a  exchange is a strategy for deferring the capital gains tax from the sale of a property by exchanging a relinquished property for likekind real estate owners may be able to defer their federal taxes and use the proceeds for the purchase of replacement property what is “likekind property” generally any form of property held for business or investment purposes qualifies including apartment buildings singlefamily rentals vacant land office buildings selfstorage facilities shopping centers and hotels these property types may be  eligible properties what does it mean to be “ eligible” not all real estate investments are eligible for  exchanges in order for your investment in real property to be  eligible you must have a direct ownership in the underlying real estate debt investments aren’t eligible because they are interests in a promissory note not the underlying real estate similarly partnership interests including llc’s where an investor owns a share of a partnership interest instead of a share of the underlying real estate would be ineligible however per the irs’s revenue ruling  ownership of a beneficiary interest in a delaware statutory trust does qualify to be part of an investor’s  exchange what is a delaware statutory trust property commonly known as “dst” this entity is often used to hold title to real estate similar to an llc instead of owning a membership interest in an llc a dst investor owns a beneficial interest in the dst also like an llc the entity shields the investor from individual liability however unlike an llc a dst  property will qualify as a “like kind” exchange replacement property for a  exchange per internal revenue ruling  what are the downsides of investing in a dst the dst is typically managed by the dst trustee and the beneficial owners do not have voting right like they would typically have in an llc instead the dst and therefore the real property investments held by the dst are managed by the trustee not the investors themselves additionally the irs established seven prohibitions over the powers of the dst trustee which includes the following once the offering is closed there can be no future equity contribution to the dst by either current or new coinvestors or beneficiaries the dst trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans nor can it borrow any new funds from any other lender or party the dst trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its investment real estate the dst trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property to those for a normal repair and maintenance b minor nonstructural capital improvements and c those required by law any liquid cash held in the dst between distribution dates can only be invested in shortterm debt obligations all cash other than necessary reserves must be distributed to the coinvestors or beneficiaries on a current basis and the trustee cannot enter into new leases or renegotiate the current leases what is a springing llc dst agreements often contain a provision that allows the trustee to convert the dst to an llc the “springing llc” if the trustee determines that the dst is in danger of losing the property due to its inability to act because of the prohibitions in the trust agreement the conversion to an llc will allow the trustee who becomes the manager of the llc to raise additional funds renegotiate terms of existing debt and enter into new leases however because a membership interest in a springing llc is not a  eligible the members investors lose their ability to defer capital gains upon the sale of the property owned by the llc through another  exchange what are the basic requirements to complete a  exchange the following is a list of the basic elements involved in typical  exchanges a qualified intermediary sometimes referred to as a “ accommodator” is used to exchange the funds from the real estate that is sold to the real estate that is purchased investors identify their replacement properties typically  properties with their  accommodator within  days of sale of the initial property investors reinvest  of the net sales proceeds from the initial property sale into their replacement properties investors acquire an equal or greater amount of debt on the replacement properties than they had on their initial properties investors close on the purchase of the replacement properties within  days of the sale of their initial property  exchanges can be very complicated and you should consult with your cpa and attorney before proceeding with an exchange can i invest if i do not currently own a  eligible property yes “cash investors” are investors who use non money to invest in a  eligible deal once they have completed their investment those investment funds become  eligible and can be used as part of a  exchange in the future sponsor – raise equity what is the process to raise equity through
