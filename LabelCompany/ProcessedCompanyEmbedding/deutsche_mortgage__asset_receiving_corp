the anticipated material federal income tax consequences of purchasing owning and disposing of the offered certificates it does not address special rules which may apply to particular types of investors the authorities on which this discussion is based are subject to change or differing interpretations and any such change or interpretation could apply retroactively investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to such investors of owning offered certificates  for purposes of this discussion unless otherwise specified the term mortgage loans will be used to refer to mortgage loans mortgagedbacked securities and contracts and the term owner will refer to the beneficial owner of an offered certificate remic elections under the internal revenue code of  the code an election may be made to treat the trust fund related to each series of certificates or segregated pools of assets within the trust fund as a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic within the meaning of section da of the code if one or more remic elections are made the certificates of any class will be either regular interests in a remic within the meaning of section ga of the code regular certificates or residual interests in a remic within the meaning of section ga of the code residual certificates the related prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will indicate whether an election will be made to treat the trust fund as one or more remics and if so which certificates will be regular certificates and which will be residual certificates if a remic election is made the trust fund or each portion thereof that is treated as a separate remic will be referred to as a remic pool if the trust fund is comprised of two remic pools one will be an uppertier remic and one a lowertier remic the assets of the lowertier remic will consist of the mortgage loans and related trust fund assets the assets of the uppertier remic will consist of all of the regular interests issued by the lowertier remic the discussion below under the heading remic certificates considers series for which a remic election will be made series for which no such election will be made are addressed under nonremic certificates remic certificates the discussion in this section applies only to a series of certificates for which a remic election is made tax opinion qualification as a remic requires ongoing compliance with certain conditions upon the issuance of each series of certificates for which a remic election is made cleary gottlieb steen  hamilton or another law firm identified in the related prospectus supplement counsel to the company will deliver its opinion generally to the effect that with respect to each such series of certificates under then existing law and assuming compliance by the company the servicer or master servicer and the trustee for such series with all of the provisions of the related agreement and such other agreements and representations as may be referred to in such opinion each remic pool will be a remic and the certificates of such series will be treated as either regular certificates or residual certificates this opinion will be filed as an exhibit to the form k relating to such series of certificates status of certificates the certificates will be  qualifying real property loans under code section d  assets described in code section ac and  real estate assets under code section ca  to the extent the assets of the related remic pool are so treated interest on the regular certificates will be interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property within the meaning of code section cb in the same proportion that the income of the remic pool is so treated if at all times  or more of the assets or income of the remic pool qualifies under the foregoing code sections the certificates and income thereon will so qualify in their entirety in the event the assets of the related remic pool include buydown mortgage loans it is unclear whether the related buydown funds would qualify under the foregoing code sections also contracts may be considered to qualify under the foregoing sections only if the manufactured homes securing such contracts are considered to be permanently fixed or permanently installed contracts may limit the ability of a borrower to permanently attach a manufactured home to its site the rules described in the two preceding paragraphs will be applied to a trust fund consisting of two remic pools as if the trust fund were a single remic holding the assets of the lowertier remic income from regular certificates general except as otherwise provided in this tax discussion regular certificates will be taxed as newly originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes interest original issue discount and market discount accrued on a regular certificate will be ordinary income to the owner all owners must account for interest income under the accrual method of accounting which may result in the inclusion of amounts in income that are not currently distributed in cash original issue discount certain regular certificates may have original issue discount an owner must include original issue discount in income as it accrues without regard to the timing of payments the total amount of original issue discount on a regular certificate is the excess of its stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price the issue price for any regular certificate is the price including any accrued interest at which a substantial portion of the class of certificates including such regular certificate are first sold to the public in general the stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all payments made on the regular certificate other than payments of interest that i are actually payable at least annually over the entire life of the certificates and ii are based on a single fixed rate or variable rate or certain combinations of fixed and variable rates the stated redemption price at maturity of a regular certificate always includes its original principal amount but generally does not include distributions of stated interest except in the case of accrual certificates and as discussed below interest only certificates an interest only certificate is a certificate entitled to receive distributions of some or all of the interest on the mortgage loans or other assets in a remic pool and that has either a notional or nominal principal amount special rules for regular certificates that provide for interest based on a variable rate are discussed below in income from regular certificatesvariable rate regular certificates with respect to an interest only certificate the stated redemption price at maturity is likely to be the sum of all payments thereon determined in accordance with the prepayment assumption as defined below in that event interest only certificates would always have original issue discount alternatively in the case of an interest only certificate with some principal amount the stated redemption price at maturity might be determined under the general rules described in the preceding paragraph if applying those rules the stated redemption price at maturity were considered to equal the principal amount of such certificate then the rules described below under premium would apply the prepayment assumption is the assumed rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans used in pricing the regular certificates the prepayment assumption will be set forth in the related supplement  under a de minimis rule original issue discount on a regular certificate will be considered zero if it is less than  of the certificates stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the certificates weighted average maturity the weighted average maturity of a regular certificate is computed based on the number of full years ie rounding down partial years each distribution of principal or other amount included in the stated redemption price at maturity is scheduled to be outstanding the schedule of such distributions likely should be determined in accordance with the prepayment assumption the owner of a regular certificate generally must include in income the original issue discount that accrues for each day on which the owner holds such certificate including the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition the original issue discount accruing in any period equals pv end  dist  pv beg where pv end  present value of all remaining distributions to be made as of the end of the period dist  distributions made during the period includible in the stated redemption price at maturity and pv be  present value of all remaining distributions as of the beginning of the period the present value of the remaining distributions is calculated based on i the original yield to maturity of the regular certificate ii events including actual prepayments that have occurred prior to the end of the period and iii the prepayment assumption for these purposes the original yield to maturity of a regular certificate will be calculated based on its issue price assuming that the certificate will be prepaid in all periods in accordance with the prepayment assumption and with compounding at the end of each accrual period used in the formula assuming the regular certificates have monthly distribution dates discount would be computed under the formula generally for the onemonth periods or shorter initial period ending on each distribution date the original issue discount accruing during any accrual period is divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day the daily portions of original issue discount generally will increase if prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans exceed the prepayment assumption and decrease if prepayments are slower than the prepayment assumption changes in the rate of prepayments having the opposite effect in the case of an interest only certificate if the relative principal payment priorities of the classes of regular certificates of a series change any increase or decrease in the present value of the remaining payments to be made on any such class will affect the computation of original issue discount for the period in which the change in payment priority occurs if original issue discount computed as described above is negative for any period the owner generally will not be allowed a current deduction for the negative amount but instead will be entitled to offset such amount only against future positive original issue discount from such certificate however while not free from doubt such an owner may be entitled to deduct negative original issue discount to the extent the owners adjusted basis as defined in sale or exchange of certificates below in the certificate remaining after such deduction is not less than the principal amount of the certificate acquisition premium if an owner of a regular certificate acquires such certificate at a price greater than its adjusted issue price but less than its remaining stated redemption price at maturity the daily portion for any day as computed above is reduced by an amount equal to the  product of i such daily portion and ii a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the price exceeds the adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the sum of the daily portions for such regular certificate for all days on and after the date of purchase the adjusted issue price of a regular certificate on any given day is its issue price increased by all original issue discount that has accrued on such certificate and reduced by the amount of all previous distributions on such certificate of amounts included in its stated redemption price at maturity market discount a regular certificate may have market discount as defined in the code market discount equals the excess of the adjusted issue price of a certificate over the owners adjusted basis in the certificate the owner of a certificate with market discount must report ordinary interest income as the owner receives distributions on the certificate of principal or other amounts included in its stated redemption price at maturity equal to the lesser of a the excess of the amount of those distributions over the amount if any of accrued original issue discount on the certificate or b the portion of the market discount that has accrued and not previously been included in income also such owner must treat gain from the disposition of the certificate as ordinary income to the extent of any accrued but unrecognized market discount alternatively an owner may elect in any taxable year to include market discount in income currently as it accrues on all market discount instruments acquired by the owner in that year or thereafter an owner may revoke such an election only with the consent of the internal revenue service in general terms market discount on a regular certificate may be treated at the owners election as accruing either a on the basis of a constant yield similar to the method described above for accruing original issue discount or b alternatively either i in the case of a regular certificate issued without original issue discount in the ratio of stated interest distributable in the relevant period to the total stated interest remaining to be distributed from the beginning of such period computed taking into account the prepayment assumption or ii in the case of a regular certificate issued with original issue discount in the ratio of the amount of original issue discount accruing in the relevant period to the total remaining original issue discount at the beginning of such period an election to accrue market discount on a regular certificate on a constant yield basis is irrevocable with respect to that certificate an owner may be required to defer a portion of the deduction for interest expense on any indebtedness that the owner incurs or maintains in order to purchase or carry a regular certificate that has market discount the deferred amount would not exceed the market discount that has accrued but not been taken into income any such deferred interest expense is in general allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which the related market discount income is recognized market discount with respect to a regular certificate will be considered to be zero if such market discount is de minimis under a rule similar to that described above in the fourth paragraph under original issue discount owners should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the market discount rules as well as the advisability of making any election with respect to market discount discount on a regular certificate that is neither original issue discount nor market discount as defined above must be allocated ratably among the principal payments on the certificate and included in income as gain from the sale or exchange of the certificate as the related principal payments are made whether as scheduled payments or prepayments premium a regular certificate other than an accrual certificate or as discussed above under original issue discount an interest only certificate purchased at a cost net of accrued interest greater than its principal amount generally is considered to be purchased at a premium the owner may elect under code section  to amortize such premium under the constant yield method using the prepayment assumption to the extent the amortized premium is allocable to interest income from the regular certificate it is treated as an offset to such interest rather than as  a separate deduction an election made by an owner would generally apply to all its debt instruments and may not be revoked without the consent of the internal revenue service special election to apply oid rules in lieu of the rules described above with respect to de minimis discount acquisition premium market discount and premium an owner of a regular certificate may elect to accrue such discount or adjust for such premium by applying the principles of the oid rules described above the election is only available for debt instruments acquired on or after april   an election made by a taxpayer with respect to one obligation can affect other obligations it holds owners should consult with their tax advisors regarding the merits of making this election retail regular certificates for purposes of the original issue and market discount rules a repayment in full of a retail certificate that is subject to payment in units or other increments rather than on a pro rata basis with other retail certificates will be treated in the same manner as any other prepayment variable rate regular certificates the regular certificates may provide for interest that varies based on an interest rate index the oid regulations provide special rules for calculating income from certain variable rate debt instruments or vrdis a debt instrument must meet certain technical requirements to qualify as a vrdi which are outlined in the next paragraph under the regulations income on a vrdi is calculated by  creating a hypothetical debt instrument that pays fixed interest at rates equivalent to the variable interest  applying the original issue discount rules of the code to that fixed rate instrument and  adjusting the income accruing in any accrual period by the difference between the assumed fixed interest amount and the actual amount for the period in general where a variable rate on a debt instrument is based on an interest rate index such as libor a fixed rate equivalent to a variable rate is determined based on the value of the index as of the issue date of the debt instrument in cases where rates are reset at different intervals over the life of a vrdi adjustments are made to ensure that the equivalent fixed rate for each accrual period is based on the same reset interval a debt instrument must meet a number of requirements in order to qualify as a vrdi a vrdi cannot be issued at a premium above its principal amount that exceeds a specified percentage of its principal amount  or if less  times its weighted average life as a result interest only certificates will never be vrdis also a debt instrument that pays interest based on a multiple of an interest rate index is not a vrdi if the multiple is less than zero or greater than  unless in general interest is paid based on a single formula that lasts over the life of the instrument a debt instrument is not a vrdi if it is subject to caps and floors unless they remain the same over the life of the instrument or are not expected to change significantly the yield on the instrument variable rate regular certificates other than interest only certificates may or may not qualify as vrdis depending on their terms in a case where a variable rate regular certificate does not qualify as a vrdi it will be treated under the oid regulations as a contingent payment debt instrument proposed regulations addressing contingent payment debt instruments were issued on december   but such regulations are not applicable by their terms to regular certificates until further guidance is forthcoming one method of calculating income on such a regular certificate that appears to be reasonable would be to apply the principles governing vrdis outlined above subordinated certificates certain series of certificates may contain one or more classes of subordinated certificates in the event there are defaults or delinquencies on the related mortgage loans amounts that otherwise would be distributed on a class of subordinated certificates may instead be distributed on other more senior classes of certificates since owners of regular certificates are required to report income under an accrual method owners of subordinated certificates will be required to report income without giving effect to delays and  reductions in distributions on such certificates attributable to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgage loans except to the extent that it can be established that amounts are uncollectible as a result the amount of income reported by an owner of a subordinated certificate in any period could significantly exceed the amount of cash distributed to such owner in that period the owner will eventually be allowed a loss or be allowed to report a lesser amount of income to the extent that the aggregate amount of distributions on the subordinated certificate is reduced as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the mortgage loans such a loss could in some circumstances be a capital loss also the timing and amount of such losses or reductions in income are uncertain owners of subordinated certificates should consult their tax advisors on these points income from residual certificates taxation of remic income generally owners of residual certificates in a remic pool residual owners must report ordinary income or loss equal to their pro rata shares based on the portion of all residual certificates they own of the taxable income or net loss of the remic such income must be reported regardless of the timing or amounts of distributions on the residual certificates the taxable income of a remic pool is generally determined under the accrual method of accounting in the same manner as the taxable income of an individual taxpayer taxable income is generally gross income including interest and original issue discount income if any on the assets of the remic pool and income from the amortization of any premium on regular certificates minus deductions market discount as defined in the code with respect to mortgage loans held by a remic pool is recognized in the same fashion as if it were original issue discount deductions include interest and original issue discount expense on the regular certificates reasonable servicing fees attributable to the remic pool other administrative expenses and amortization of any premium on assets of the remic pool as previously discussed the timing of recognition of negative original issue discount if any on a regular certificate is uncertain as a result the timing of recognition of the corresponding income to the remic pool is also uncertain if the trust fund consists of an uppertier remic and a lowertier remic the regular interests issued by the lowertier remic to the upper tier remic will be treated as a single debt instrument for purposes of the original issue discount provisions a residual owner may not amortize the cost of its residual certificate taxable income of the remic pool however will not include cash received by the remic pool that represents a recovery of the remic pools initial basis in its assets and such basis will include the issue price of the residual certificates assuming the issue price is positive such recovery of basis by the remic pool will have the effect of amortization of the issue price of the residual certificate over its life the period of time over which such issue price is effectively amortized however may be longer than the economic life of the residual certificate the issue price of a residual certificate is the price at which a substantial portion of the class of certificates including the residual certificate are first sold to the public or if the residual certificate is not publicly offered the price paid by the first buyer a subsequent residual owner must report the same amounts of taxable income or net loss attributable to the remic pool as an original owner no adjustments are made to reflect the purchase price losses a residual owner that is allocated a net loss of the remic pool may not deduct such loss currently to the extent it exceeds the owners adjusted basis as defined in sale or exchange of certificates below in its residual certificate a residual owner that is a us person as defined below in taxation of certain foreign investors however may carry over any disallowed loss to offset any taxable income generated by the same remic pool  excess inclusions a portion of the taxable income allocated to a residual certificate is subject to special tax rules that portion referred to as an excess inclusion is calculated for each calendar quarter and equals the excess of such taxable income for the quarter over the daily accruals for the quarter the daily accruals equal the product of i  of the federal longterm rate under code section d for the month which includes the closing date determined on the basis of quarterly compounding and properly adjusted for the length of the quarter and ii the adjusted issue price of the certificate at the beginning of such quarter the adjusted issue price of a residual certificate at the beginning of a quarter is the issue price of the certificate plus the amount of daily accruals on the certificate for all prior quarters decreased but not below zero by any prior distributions on the certificate if the aggregate value of the residual certificates is not considered to be significant then to the extent provided in treasury regulations a residual owners entire share of remic taxable income will be treated as an excess inclusion the regulations that have been adopted under code sections a through og the remic regulations do not contain such a rule excess inclusions generally may not be offset by unrelated losses or loss carryforwards or carrybacks of a residual owner an owner that is a thrift institution however is generally permitted to use losses to offset excess inclusions from a residual certificate if such certificate has significant value the remic regulations provide that a remic residual interest has significant value if i the issue price of such interest equals at least  of the aggregate of the issue prices of all interests in the remic and ii the anticipated weighted average life of such remic residual interest is at least  of the anticipated weighted average life of the remic excess inclusions are treated as unrelated business taxable income for an organization subject to the tax on unrelated business income in addition under treasury regulations yet to be issued if a real estate investment trust regulated investment company or certain other passthrough entities are residual owners a portion of the distributions made by such entities may be treated as excess inclusions distributions distributions on a residual certificate whether at their scheduled times or as a result of prepayments generally will not result in any taxable income or loss to the residual owner if the amount of any distribution exceeds a residual owners adjusted basis in its residual certificate however the residual owner will recognize gain treated as gain from the sale or exchange of its residual certificate to the extent of such excess see sale or exchange of certificates below prohibited transactions special taxes net income recognized by a remic pool from prohibited transactions is subject to a  tax and is disregarded in calculating the remic pools taxable income in addition a remic pool is subject to federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on net income from foreclosure property which has a technical definition a  tax also applies to certain contributions to a remic pool made after it is formed it is not anticipated that any remic pool will i engage in prohibited transactions in which it recognizes a significant amount of net income ii receive contributions of property that are subject to tax or iii derive a significant amount of net income from foreclosure property that is subject to tax negative value residual certificates the federal income tax treatment of any consideration paid to a transferee on a transfer of a residual certificate is unclear such a transferee should consult its tax advisor the preamble to the remic regulations indicates that the internal revenue service may issue future guidance on the tax treatment of such payments securities dealers on december   the internal revenue service released temporary regulations under code section  the temporary section  regulations relating to the requirement that a dealer in securities mark certain securities to market on january    the internal revenue service released proposed regulations containing additional guidance on section  the proposed section  regulations in general the temporary section  regulations provide that a remic residual interest that has negative value when acquired is not a security for purposes of code section  whether a residual interest has negative value is determined under a present value formula described in the temporary section  regulations the temporary section  regulations apply to taxable years ending on or after december   furthermore the temporary section  regulations provide the internal revenue service with the authority to treat any interest or arrangement having substantially the same economic effect as a negative value residual interest as a negative value residual interest the proposed section  regulations provide that any residual interest regardless of whether it has negative value as described in the preceding paragraph and any arrangement having substantially the same economic effect that is acquired on or after january   is not a security for the purposes of code section  under the proposed section  regulations residual interests acquired before january   would be subject to the rules in the temporary section  regulations relating to negative value residual interests prospective purchasers of a residual certificate should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the temporary section  regulations and the proposed section  regulations the method of taxation of residual certificates described in this section can produce a significantly less favorable aftertax return for a residual certificate than would be the case if the certificate were taxable as a debt instrument also a residual owners return may be adversely affected by the excess inclusions rules described above in certain periods taxable income and the resulting tax liability for a residual owner may exceed any distributions it receives in addition a substantial tax may be imposed on certain transferors of a residual certificate and certain residual owners that are passthru entities see transfers of residual certificates below investors should consult their tax advisors before purchasing a residual certificate sale or exchange of certificates an owner generally will recognize gain or loss upon sale or exchange of a regular or residual certificate equal to the difference between the amount realized and the owners adjusted basis in the certificate the adjusted basis in a certificate generally will equal the cost of the certificate increased by income previously recognized and reduced but not below zero by previous distributions and by any amortized premium in the case of a regular certificate or net losses allowed as a deduction in the case of a residual certificate except as described below any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a certificate held as a capital asset will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm or shortterm depending on whether the certificate has been held for more than one year such gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss i for a bank or thrift institution and ii in the case of a regular certificate a to the extent of any accrued but unrecognized market discount or b to the extent income recognized by the owner is less than the income that would have been recognized if the yield on such certificate were  of the applicable federal rate under code section d a residual owner should be allowed a loss upon termination of the remic pool equal to the amount of the owners remaining adjusted basis in its residual certificates whether the termination will be treated as a sale or exchange resulting in a capital loss is unclear  except as provided in treasury regulations the wash sale rules of code section  will apply to dispositions of a residual certificate where the seller of the interest during the period beginning six months before the sale or disposition of the interest and ending six months after such sale or disposition acquires or enters into any other transaction that results in the application of code section  any remic residual interest or any interest in a taxable mortgage pool such as a nonremic owner trust that is economically comparable to a residual interest taxation of certain foreign investors regular certificates a regular certificate held by an owner that is a nonus person as defined below and that has no connection with the united states other than owning the certificate will not be subject to us withholding or income tax with respect to the certificate provided such owner i is not a percent shareholder within the meaning of code section hb or a controlled foreign corporation described in code section cc and ii provides an appropriate statement signed under penalties of perjury identifying the owner and stating among other things that the owner is a nonus person if these conditions are not met a  withholding tax will apply to interest including original issue discount unless an income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such tax or unless the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states by such owner in the latter case such owner will be subject to united states federal income tax with respect to all income from the certificate at regular rates then applicable to us taxpayers and in the case of a corporation possibly also the branch profits tax the term nonus person means any person other than a us person a us person is a citizen or resident of the united states a corporation partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof or an estate or trust that is subject to us federal income tax regardless of the source of its income residual certificates a residual owner that is a nonus person and that has no connection with the united states other than owning a residual certificate will not be subject to us withholding or income tax with respect to the certificate other than with respect to excess inclusions provided that i the conditions described in the second preceding paragraph with respect to regular certificates are met and ii in the case of a residual certificate in a remic pool holding mortgage loans the mortgage loans were originated after july   excess inclusions are subject to a  withholding tax in all events notwithstanding any contrary tax treaty provisions when distributed to the residual owner or when the residual certificate is disposed of the code grants the treasury department authority to issue regulations requiring excess inclusions to be taken into account earlier if necessary to prevent avoidance of tax the remic regulations do not contain such a rule the preamble thereto states that the internal revenue service is considering issuing regulations concerning withholding on distributions to foreign holders of residual interests to satisfy accrued tax liability due to excess inclusions with respect to a residual certificate that has been held at any time by a nonus person the trustee or its agent will be entitled to withhold and to pay to the internal revenue service any portion of any payment on such residual certificate that the trustee reasonably determines is required to be withheld if the trustee or its agent reasonably determines that a more accurate determination of the amount required to be withheld from a distribution can be made within a reasonable period after the scheduled date for such distribution it may hold such distribution in trust for the residual owner until such determination can be made special tax rules and restrictions that apply to transfers of residual certificates to and from nonus persons are discussed in the next section  transfers of residual certificates special tax rules and restrictions apply to transfers of residual certificates to disqualified organizations or foreign investors and to transfers of noneconomic residual certificates disqualified organizations in order to comply with the remic rules of the code the agreement will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in a residual certificate may be transferred to or registered in the name of any person unless i the proposed purchaser provides to the trustee an affidavit within the meaning of the remic regulations to the effect that among other items such transferee is not a disqualified organization as defined below is not purchasing a residual certificate as an agent for a disqualified organization ie as a broker nominee or other middleman and is not an entity a bookentry nominee that holds remic residual securities as nominee to facilitate the clearance and settlement of such securities through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of participating organizations and ii the transferor states in writing to the trustee that it has no actual knowledge that such affidavit is false if despite these restrictions a residual certificate is transferred to a disqualified organization the transfer may result in a tax equal to the product of i the present value of the total anticipated future excess inclusions with respect to such certificate and ii the highest corporate marginal federal income tax rate such a tax generally is imposed on the transferor except that if the transfer is through an agent for a disqualified organization the agent is liable for the tax a transferor is not liable for such tax if the transferee furnishes to the transferor an affidavit that the transferee is not a disqualified organization and as of the time of the transfer the transferor does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false a disqualified organization may hold an interest in a remic certificate through a passthru entity as defined below in that event the passthru entity is subject to tax at the highest corporate marginal federal income tax rate on excess inclusions allocable to the disqualified organization however such tax will not apply to the extent the passthru entity receives affidavits from record holders of interests in the entity stating that they are not disqualified organizations and the entity does not have actual knowledge that the affidavits are false for these purposes i disqualified organization means the united states any state or political subdivision thereof any foreign government any international organization any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing certain organizations that are exempt from taxation under the code including tax on excess inclusions and certain corporations operating on a cooperative basis and ii passthru entity means any regulated investment company real estate investment trust common trust fund partnership trust or estate and certain corporations operating on a cooperative basis except as may be provided in treasury regulations any person holding an interest in a passthru entity as a nominee for another will with respect to that interest be treated as a passthru entity foreign investors under the remic regulations a transfer of a residual certificate to a nonus person that will not hold the certificate in connection with a us trade or business will be disregarded for all federal tax purposes if the certificate has tax avoidance potential a residual certificate has tax avoidance potential unless at the time of transfer the transferor reasonably expects that i for each excess inclusion the remic will distribute to the transferee residual interest holder an amount that will equal at least  percent of the excess inclusion and ii each such amount will be distributed at or after the time at which the excess inclusion accrues and not later than the close of the calendar year following the calendar year of accrual a transferor has such reasonable expectation if the above test would be met assuming that the remics mortgage loans will prepay at each rate between  percent and  percent of the prepayment assumption  the remic regulations also provide that a transfer of a residual certificate from a nonus person to a us person or to a nonus person that will hold the certificate in connection with a us trade or business is disregarded if the transfer has the effect of allowing the transferor to avoid tax on accrued excess inclusions in light of these provisions the agreement provides that a residual certificate may not be purchased by or transferred to any person that is not a us person unless i such person holds the certificate in connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states and furnishes the transferor and the trustee with an effective internal revenue service form  or ii the transferee delivers to both the transferor and the trustee an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that such transfer is in accordance with the requirements of the code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and that such transfer will not be disregarded for federal income tax purposes noneconomic residual certificates under the remic regulations a transfer of a noneconomic residual certificate will be disregarded for all federal income tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transfer is to impede the assessment or collection of tax such a purpose exists if the transferor at the time of the transfer either knew or should have known that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the taxable income of the remic a transferor is presumed to lack such knowledge if i the transferor conducted at the time of the transfer a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the transferee and found that the transferee had historically paid its debts as they came due and found no significant evidence to indicate that the transferee will not continue to pay its debts as they become due and ii the transferee represents to the transferor that it understands that as the holder of the noneconomic residual interest it may incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the interest and that it intends to pay taxes associated with holding the residual interest as they become due a residual certificate including a certificate with significant value at issuance is noneconomic unless at the time of the transfer i the present value of the expected future distributions on the certificate at least equals the product of the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions and the highest corporate income tax rate in effect for the year in which the transfer occurs and ii the transferor reasonably expects that the transferee will receive distributions on the certificate at or after the time at which taxes accrue in an amount sufficient to pay the taxes the agreement will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in a residual certificate may be transferred to or registered in the name of any person unless the transferor represents to the trustee that it has conducted the investigation of the transferee and made the findings described in the preceding paragraph and the proposed transferee provides to the trustee the transferee representations described in the preceding paragraph and agrees that it will not transfer the certificate to any person unless that person agrees to comply with the same restrictions on future transfers pending legislation legislation has been proposed which would provide that effective for taxable years beginning after december   alternative minimum taxable income of a residual owner cannot be less than the owners excess inclusions legislation has also been proposed which would effective for taxable years beginning after december   eliminate the exception to the excess inclusion rules for thrift institutions that hold residual interests with significant value no prediction can be made whether any such proposed legislation will be enacted  servicing compensation and other remic pool expenses under code section  an individual estate or trust is allowed certain itemized deductions only to the extent that such deductions in the aggregate exceed  of the owners adjusted gross income and such a person is not allowed such deductions to any extent in computing its alterative minimum tax liability under treasury regulations if such a person is an owner of a remic certificate the remic pool is required to allocate to such a person its share of the servicing fees and administrative expenses paid by a remic together with an equal amount of income those fees and expenses are deductible as an offset to the additional income but subject to the  floor in the case of a remic pool that has multiple classes of regular certificates with staggered maturities fees and expenses of the remic pool would be allocated entirely to the owners of residual certificates however if the remic pool were a singleclass remic as defined in applicable treasury regulations such deductions would be allocated proportionately among the regular and residual certificates reporting and administrative matters annual reports will be made to the internal revenue service and to holders of record of regular certificates and owners of regular certificates holding through a broker nominee or other middleman that are not excepted from the reporting requirements of accrued interest original issue discount information necessary to compute accruals of market discount information regarding the percentage of the remic pools assets meeting the qualified assets tests described above under status of certificates and where relevant allocated amounts of servicing fees and other code section  expenses holders not receiving such reports may obtain such information from the related remic by contacting the person designated in irs publication  quarterly reports will be made to residual holders showing their allocable shares of income or loss from the remic pool excess inclusions and code section  expenses the trustee will sign and file federal income tax returns for each remic pool to the extent allowable the company will act as the tax matters person for each remic pool each owner of a residual certificate by the acceptance of its residual certificate agrees that the company will act as the owners agent in the performance of any duties required of the owner in the event that the owner is the tax matters person an owner of a residual certificate is required to treat items on its federal income tax return consistently with the treatment of the items on the remic pools return unless the owner owns  of the residual certificate for the entire calendar year or the owner either files a statement identifying the inconsistency or establishes that the inconsistency resulted from incorrect information received from the remic pool the internal revenue service may assess a deficiency resulting from a failure to comply with the consistency requirement without instituting an administrative proceeding at the remic level any person that holds a residual certificate as a nominee for another person may be required to furnish the remic pool in a manner to be provided in treasury regulations the name and address of such other person and other information nonremic certificates the discussion in this section applies only to a series of certificates for which no remic election is made trust fund as grantor trust upon issuance of each series of certificates cleary gottlieb steen  hamilton or another law firm identified in the related prospectus supplement counsel to the company will deliver its  opinion to the effect that under then current law assuming compliance by the company the servicer or master servicer and the trustee with all the provisions of the agreement and such other agreements and representations as may be referred to in the opinion the trust fund will be classified for federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation this opinion will be filed as an exhibit to the form k relating to such series of certificates under the grantor trust rules of the code each owner of a certificate will be treated for federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the mortgage loans and any related assets included in the trust fund the owner will include in its gross income gross income from the portion of the mortgage loans allocable to the certificate and may deduct its share of the expenses paid by the trust fund that are allocable to the certificate at the same time and to the same extent as if it had directly purchased and held such interest in the mortgage loans and had directly received payments thereon and paid such expenses if an owner is an individual trust or estate the owner will be allowed deductions for its share of trust fund expenses including reasonable servicing fees only to the extent that the sum of those expenses and the owners other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds  of adjusted gross income and will not be allowed to deduct such expenses for purposes of the alternative minimum tax distributions on a certificate will not be taxable to the owner and the timing or amount of distributions will not affect the timing or amount of income or deductions relating to a certificate status of the certificates the offered certificates other than interest only certificates will be  qualifying real property loans under code section d  real estate assets under code section ca and  assets described in section ac of the code to the extent the assets of the trust fund are so treated interest income from such certificates will be interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property under code section cb to the extent the income of the trust fund qualifies under that section an interest only certificate is a certificate which is entitled to receive distributions of some or all of the interest on the mortgage loans or other assets in a remic pool and that has either a notional or nominal principal amount although not certain certificates that are interest only certificates should qualify under the foregoing code sections to the same extent as other certificates possible application of stripped bond rules the federal income tax treatment of certificates will depend on whether they are subject to the stripped bond rules of code section  in general certificates will be subject to those rules in the hands of an owner if i the company or anyone else retains rights to receive more than  basis points of interest on any mortgage loans assigned to the trust fund disregarding rights to reasonable servicing compensation but including rights to fees in excess of reasonable compensation or ii certificates are issued in two or more classes representing rights to nonpro rata shares of interest and principal payments on the mortgage loans notwithstanding the foregoing a certificate will not be subject to the stripped bond rules in the hands of an owner unless viewing the certificate as a debt instrument issued by the trust fund it would have original issue discount in general a certificate will not have original issue discount if it pays interest at a fixed rate or a single variable rate monthly over its entire life is issued within one month of the first distribution date and is issued with no more than a de minimis  amount of discount below its principal amount discount is de minimis if the certificate has an issue price generally the initial offering price at which a substantial amount of certificates are sold that is not less than its principal amount by more than  times the weighted average life of the certificate calculated by rounding down the number of years to each principal payment to the next lowest number for a more detailed discussion of the definition of original issue discount see remic certificatesincome from regular certificatesoriginal issue discount above taxation of certificates if stripped bond rules do not apply if the stripped bond rules do not apply to a certificate then the owner will be required to include in income its share of the interest payments on the mortgage loans held by the trust fund in accordance with its tax accounting method the owner must also account for discount or premium on the mortgage loans if it is considered to have purchased its interest in the mortgage loans at a discount or premium an owner will be considered to have purchased an interest in each mortgage loan at a price determined by allocating its purchase price for the certificate among the mortgage loans in proportion to their fair market values at the time of purchase it is likely that discount would be considered to accrue and premium would be amortized as described below based on an assumption that there will be no future prepayments of the mortgage loans and not based on a reasonable prepayment assumption discount the treatment of any discount relating to a mortgage loan will depend on whether the discount is original issue discount or market discount discount at which a mortgage loan is purchased will be original issue discount only if the mortgage loan itself has original issue discount the issuance of certificates is not considered a new issuance of a debt instrument that can give rise to original issue discount a mortgage loan generally will be considered to have original issue discount if the greater of the amount of points charged to the borrower or the amount of any interest foregone during any initial teaser period exceeds  of the principal amount of the mortgage loan times the number of full years to maturity ie  of the principal amount for a  year loan or if interest is not paid at a fixed rate or a single variable rate disregarding any initial teaser rate over the life of the mortgage loan it is not anticipated that the amount of original issue discount if any accruing on the mortgage loans in each month will be significant relative to the interest paid currently on the mortgage loans but there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the case of a mortgage loan that is considered to have been purchased with market discount that exceeds a de minimis amount generally  of the principal amount times the number of whole years to maturity remaining at the time of purchase the owner will be required to include in income in each month the amount of such discount that has accrued through such month and not previously been included in income but limited to the amount of principal on the mortgage loan that is received by the trust fund in that month because the mortgage loans will provide for monthly principal payments such discount may be required to be included in income at a rate that is not significantly slower than the rate at which such discount accrues any market discount that has not previously been included in income will be recognized as ordinary income if and when the mortgage loan is prepaid in full for a more detailed discussion of the market discount rules of the code see remic certificatesincome from regular certificatesmarket discount above in the case of market discount that does not exceed a de minimis amount the owner generally will be required to allocate ratably the portion of such discount that is allocable to a mortgage loan among the principal payments on the mortgage loan and to include the discount in ordinary income as the related principal payments are made whether as scheduled payments or prepayments premium in the event that a mortgage loan is purchased at a premium the owner may elect under section  of the code to amortize such premium under a constant yield method based  on the yield of the mortgage loan to such owner provided that such mortgage loan was originated after september   premium allocable to a mortgage loan originated on or before that date should be allocated among the principal payments on the mortgage loan and allowed as an ordinary deduction as principal payments are made whether as scheduled payments or prepayments taxation of certificates if stripped bond rules apply if the stripped bond rules apply to a certificate income on the certificate will be treated as original issue discount and will be included in income as it accrues under a constant yield method more specifically for purposes of applying the original issue discount rules of the code the owner will likely be taxed as if it had purchased a newly issued single debt instrument providing for payments equal to the payments on the interests in the mortgage loans allocable to the certificate and having original issue discount equal to the excess of the sum of such payments over the owners purchase price for the certificate which would be treated as the issue price the amount of original issue discount income accruing in any taxable year will be computed generally as described above under remic certificatesincome from regular certificatesoriginal issue discount it is possible however that the calculation must be made using as the prepayment assumption an assumption of zero prepayments if the calculation is made assuming no future prepayments then the owner should be allowed to deduct currently any negative amount of original issue discount produced by the accrual formula different approaches could be applied in calculating income under the stripped bond rules for example a certificate could be viewed as a collection of separate debt instruments one for each payment allocable to the certificate rather than a single debt instrument also in the case of an interestonly certificate it could be argued that certain proposed regulations governing contingent payment debt obligations apply owners should consult their own tax advisors regarding the calculation of income under the stripped bond rules sales of certificates a certificateholder that sells a certificate will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized in the sale and its adjusted tax basis in the certificate in general such adjusted basis will equal the certificateholders cost for the certificate increased by the amount of any income previously reported with respect to the certificate and decreased but not below zero by the amount of any distributions received thereon the amount of any losses previously allowable to such owner with respect to such certificate and any premium amortization thereon any such gain or loss would be capital gain or loss if the certificate was held as a capital asset subject to the potential treatment of gain as ordinary income to the extent of any accrued but unrecognized market discount under the market discount rules of the code if applicable foreign investors except as described in the following paragraph an owner that is not a u s person as defined under remic certificates taxation of certain foreign investors above and that is not subject to federal income tax as a result of any direct or indirect connection to the united states in addition to its ownership of a certificate will not be subject to united states income or withholding tax in respect of a certificate assuming the underlying mortgage loans were originated after july   if the owner provides an appropriate statement signed under penalties of perjury identifying the owner and stating among other things that the owner is not a us person if these conditions are not met a  withholding tax will apply to interest including original issue discount unless an income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such tax or unless the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states by such owner income effectively connected with a us trade or business will be subject to united states  federal income tax at regular rates then applicable to us taxpayers and in the case of a corporation possibly also the branch profits tax in the event the trust fund acquires ownership of real property located in the united states in connection with a default on a mortgage loan then any rental income from such property allocable to an owner that is not a us person generally will be subject to a  withholding tax in addition any gain from the disposition of such real property allocable to an owner that is not a us person may be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business under special rules governing united states real property interests the trust fund may be required to withhold tax on gain realized upon a disposition of such real property by the trust fund at a  rate reporting tax information will be reported annually to the internal revenue service and to holders of certificates that are not excluded from the reporting requirements backup withholding distributions made on a certificate and proceeds from the sale of a certificate to or through certain brokers may be subject to a backup withholding tax of  unless in general the owner of the certificate complies with certain procedures or is a corporation or other person exempt from such withholding any amounts so withheld from distributions on the certificates would be refunded by the internal revenue service or allowed as a credit against the owners federal income tax state tax considerations in addition to the federal income tax consequences described in federal income tax consequences potential investors should consider the state income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the offered certificates state income tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding federal law and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state therefore potential investors should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the various state tax consequences of an investment in the offered certificates brokerage partners   edgar online inc all rights reserved  nasdaq edgr  solutions for corporations  terms of use  privacy
