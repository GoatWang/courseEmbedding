using invasive methods the accuracy of ember is  gdl at one standard deviation this means that  of the hemoglobin values measured on the ember device should fall within   gdl of invasive methods used to measure hemoglobin based on an internal study the trend accuracy of ember defined as its ability to detect changes in hemoglobin values when compared against an invasive method was shown to be  gdl at one standard deviation ember’s precision precision is defined as the closeness of two or more measurements to one another this is sometimes referred to as repeatability based on an internal study

sitereturn home elevation affectback to sitereturn home elevation affects hemoglobin hgb overviewelevation training also referred to as altitude training is used by many competitive athletes to increase their performance potential hemoglobin the protein that binds and carries oxygen throughout the body increases in response to elevation this paper is a compilation of key findings on the bodyʼs response to elevation and is designed to give you a high level understanding of the concepts involved it will also explain how your ember device can help you in your elevation trainingwhat is the driving force behind altitudeinduced changes in the bodythe main force that drives all these changes is the lower pressure of air at high elevations upon exposure to significant elevation increase  m ft the lungs cardiovascular system and kidneys begin to make changes to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilationlower air pressure means less oxygenthe air you breathe is composed of  oxygen with the rest being carbon dioxide nitrogen and trace gases these gases as well as water vapor in the air exert a certain amount of pressure that bears down upon you this pressure varies depending on the elevation you are at and is lower when you go above sea level for example mount everest nepal  m ft and higher when you go below sea level for example death valley ca  m feet although the percentage of oxygen is still  less pressure at elevation means that for any given amount of air there will be less oxygen per breathisnʼt breathing less oxygen dangerousbreathing less oxygen would be dangerous to the body if it were not for the compensatory changes the body makes to counteract this at higher elevations the breathing rate increases to keep up the oxygen intake despite the lower oxygen similarly the heart pumps faster to keep up the delivery of oxygen to the tissues most importantly for the athlete however is that within even a few hours of exposure to high altitude the kidneys increase their release of a hormone called erythropoietin erythropoietin acts on the bone marrow to increase production of red blood cells and hemoglobin this surge in erythropoietin and the subsequent increase in hemoglobin is the key benefit of elevation training the more hemoglobin available the more oxygen that can be delivered to muscleshow long should an athlete live at higher elevation to see an increase in their hemoglobinwhile the initial increase in erythropoietin is seen within a few hours the true and sustained increase in hemoglobin is typically within  weeks  furthermore there is variability in individuals in the amount of erythropoietin their kidneys release in response to elevation and still further variability as to the extent to which their body reacts to the erythropoietin and produces new hemoglobin  that is why frequent measurement of hemoglobin would help athletes gauge their response to elevation and help them decide when they have reached their maximum and sustained hemoglobin levelsif my hemoglobin levels drop soon after i return to sea level then what is the best time to participate in a major competition to optimize my performancerecommendations from top coaches and applied sport scientists on when to compete upon returning to sea level vary some advocate competing within the first  hours upon returning to sea level while others advocate between  days because of this wide variability frequent noninvasive hemoglobin measurements with the ember device may help in determining the best individual time to competei am seeing an increase in my hemoglobin just after a few days at elevation despite being told it takes weeks is that normal and does that mean iʼve reached my hemoglobin targetthis is a normal response to elevation however this initial increase in hemoglobin can be misleading within the first few hours of arrival at elevation plasma volume the “water” component of blood begins to decrease and reaches a low point days to weeks later because hemoglobin is measured as a concentration when the plasma volume decreases it will elevate the value of hemoglobin even though no new hemoglobin molecules have been made however over a period of few weeks at elevation the plasma volume increases back to normal and thus the hemoglobin value will drop back as well continued and sustained elevation training past this point will induce the increase in hemoglobin that the athlete is seekinghow soon would the elevated hemoglobin levels begin to come down once at sea levelthere appears to be a fairly rapid drop in hemoglobin even in residents who have been living at higher elevation once they descend to sea level in one finding it was reported that longterm residents of cerro de pasco peru elevation  m experienced a  reduction in red blood cell mass just  days after descent to sea level   since red blood cells are full of hemoglobin less red blood cell mass means less hemoglobin in another finding a group of elite kenyan runners descending from moderate elevation  m to near sea level  m saw a hemoglobin reduction after  days at sea level reaching a low point at about  days how would the changes experienced at higher elevation translate to the measurements on the ember deviceif performed correctly ember will help track increases in hemoglobin over time through trended graphs it is recommended that multiple daily measurements be performed with particular attention being placed on consistent measurement techniques this means testing at the same time under the same conditions and in the same positionposture whenever possible in particular it is recommended that a “st of day” measurement be done daily when training at elevation this means performing a measurement upon waking and before getting out of bed drinking fluids or using the bathroomwhat are the ideal elevations for elevation trainingtypically most competitive athletes train at elevation between  m  ft and  m  ft below this the atmospheric pressure is not low enough to trigger the physiologic response increase in hemoglobin production beyond this there is the potential for adverse health effects and is generally not recommended  in a study that appeared in the journal of applied physiology chapman et al suggests that the ideal window is between  m  ft and  m  ft  to download this page as a pdf click here

sitereturn home exercise impact on hemoglobin levels exercise and training regimens can have a substantial impact on hemoglobinin general exercise alters hemoglobin in two ways acute and chronic changes in the plasma water component of blood and the actual change in the amount of hemoglobin present these changes can be seen in the short term minutes to hours or long term days to weeks because hemoglobin is a concentration any shift in the amount of plasma can change its value plasma volume can decrease immediately upon initiation of intense exercise as a result of blood pressure increase hormonal changes and sweating  this decrease can raise hemoglobin in the short term and is known as hemoconcentration conversely increased hydration such as drinking water after exercise can bring the hemoglobin levels back down in a process known as hemodilutionfurthermore long term changes in plasma and thus hemoglobin concentrations can also be seen in response to the type and duration of exercise regimens  for example it is noted that endurance athletes may have lower hemoglobin levels as their bodies chronically increase the plasma volume in response to exercise despite the increase in hemoglobin produced as a result of exercise this overall increase in plasma volume causes hemodilution  these hemoglobin changes observed with fluid shifts even led to the researchers dill and costill devising an equation based on hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations to calculate the blood volume and plasma volume changes that have occurred  production of hemoglobin itself can also be affected by exercise in general the production of red blood cells rbcʼs hemoglobin and release of rbcʼs into circulation increases in response to sustained training  however factors such as type of exercise type of athlete intensity of training and elevation at training can all impact the extent of this increase for instance it was noted in one study that within the athlete population strength trained athletes had higher hemoglobin than endurance or mixtrained athletes  furthermore “leisuretime” athletes had lower hemoglobin than competitive athletes  clearly there are many factors that influence hemoglobin changes in response to exercise as in many areas of human physiology there also exists individual variation in responses as well thus the ability to noninvasively measure hemoglobin with ember on a daily basis or pre and post workout has the potential to give athletes greater clarity into how their exercise regimen is impacting their hemoglobin levelsto download this
