revisiting richard dawkins’ bestseller the god delusion in preparation for an apologetics class i’ll be teaching next week on opening it up i fell upon the dedication “in memoriam” to douglas adams accompanied by the following quotation presumably from adams isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too i suppose dawkins considered this a pithy critique of theistic beliefs and in keeping with the thrust of his book it does at least give us some insight into how dawkins and his ilk think about theism ie that it’s epistemically on a par with belief in fairies at the bottom of the garden but it also reflects just how shallow that thinking is of course it’s enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it because the former doesn’t depend on the latter in any plausible way fairies have no explanatory role to play in one’s appreciation of a beautiful garden but theists have long contended that god has a significant explanatory role to play in our understanding of the world and our place in it indeed a necessary explanatory role so a more fitting question would be isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there is a gardener who made it beautiful to which the answer isn’t obviously a selfcongratulatory “yes” but rather at a minimum “well it depends on exactly what we see in the garden” if the garden we see is an orderly cultivated one then the answer is clearly “no it’s not enough a rational person ought to believe both” in fact an even more probing question would be isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without considering not only whether there is a gardener who made it beautiful but also how it is that we came to possess reliable cognitive faculties which allow us to see gardens to conceive of them as gardens and to make meaningful objective aesthetic judgments about them but that doesn’t sound nearly so witty which i guess goes to show that cleverness and profundity don’t always coincide →  comment posted in apologetics tagged atheism naturalism

grading season as i’ve noted before there’s an occasional silver lining to this otherwise purgatorial duty namely occasionally encountering an amusing typo or other lapsus calami five years ago i posted a collection of these gaffes and as an act of solidarity with my fellow professors i now post a second batch all are genuine first however let me repeat some important words of qualification from my earlier post i should emphasize that most of these are innocent mistakes and no reflection on the abilities of the students who wrote them some of them appeared in otherwise excellent papers they’re the sort of errors any of us could make and many of us have made especially when under the pressure of a deadline or ambushed by the autocorrect feature of our word processors so enjoy them

the death of god posted on  may    comment dale tuggy has recently been discussing at some length what he takes to be an inconsistent triad of claims  jesus died  jesus was fully divine  no fully divine being has ever died he thinks that  is beyond dispute for biblebelieving christians and that  also finds strong support from the biblical affirmations of god’s immortality rom   tim   tim  he therefore concludes that  should be rejected for the sake of logical consistency that would of course require one to reject one of the essential tenets of the doctrine of the trinity i’ve listened to several of dale’s podcasts on the issue but not all of them so i may well be overlooking something here still it seems to me that there’s a fairly straightforward way for a trinitarian to affirm all three claims without inconsistency i agree with tuggy that there’s solid biblical support for  and  but as i see it there’s an equivocation on the term ‘died’ i know that dale has denied any such equivocation but hear me out continue reading → →  comment posted in philosophy theology tagged dale tuggy death incarnation trinity unitarianism t s eliot on reading for amusement posted on  may   comments off on t s eliot on reading for amusement some insight from eliot’s essay “religion and literature”  now what we get as we gradually grow up and read more and more and read a greater diversity of authors is a variety of views of life but what people commonly assume i suspect is that we gain this experience of other men’s views of life only by “improving reading” this it is supposed is a reward we get by applying ourselves to shakespeare and dante and goethe and emerson and carlyle and dozens of other respectable writers the rest of our reading for amusement is merely killing time but i incline to come to the alarming conclusion that it is just the literature that we read for “amusement” or “purely for pleasure” that may have the greatest and least suspected influence upon us it is the literature which we read with the least effort that can have the easiest and most insidious influence upon us hence it is that the influence of popular novelists and of popular plays of contemporary life requires to be scrutinized most closely and it is chiefly contemporary literature that the majority of people ever read in this attitude of “purely for pleasure” of pure passivity the relation to my subject of what i have been saying should now be a little more apparent though we may read literature merely for pleasure of “entertainment” or of “aesthetic enjoyment” this reading never affects simply a sort of special sense it affects our moral and religious existence and i say that while individual modern writers of eminence can be improving contemporary literature as a whole tends to be degrading and that even the effect of the better writers in an age like ours may be degrading to some readers for we must remember that what a writer does to people is not necessarily what he intends to do it may be only what people are capable of having done to them people exercise an unconscious selection in being influenced a writer like d h lawrence may be in his effect either beneficial or pernicious i am not sure that i have not had some pernicious influence myself one can only imagine what eliot would have concluded about the influence of movies tv shows and youtube videos on our “moral and religious existence” comments off on t s eliot on reading for amusement posted in culture tagged literature media pleasure some thoughts on the lowderturek debate posted on  may    comments i recently watched or rather listened to the debate last december between jeffrey jay lowder and frank turek on whether naturalism or theism “better explains reality” overall it was one of the better theistatheist debates i’ve encountered and i would recommend watching it the two opponents were intelligent wellspoken respectful experienced and focused on the issues i’m not going to evaluate all the arguments in the debate or make a judgment about who ‘won’ the debate it depends which criteria you apply i’m just going to make some very general comments about the strengths and weaknesses of the presentations continue reading → →  comments posted in apologetics tagged antitheism atheism frank turek jeffrey jay lowder naturalism public debate theism a selection of presuppositional arguments posted on  april    comments one criticism of presuppositional apologetics is that its advocates rarely if ever offer serious arguments for their distinctive claims eg the claim that our ability to reason presupposes the existence of god the criticism is overstated but there is a measure of truth to it i count myself a presuppositionalist but i’ve been frustrated in the past by presuppositionalists who seem to imagine that declaring what van til’s “transcendental argument” purports to demonstrate is tantamount to actually making that demonstration simply asserting that “without god you can’t prove anything at all” or that “your very ability to reason presupposes the existence of god” does nothing whatsoever to explain why those weighty assertions should be believed likewise for the failure of nonchristians to answer questions asking them to account for their ability to reason to know truths about the world to make meaningful moral judgments etc in terms of their own worldviews questions cannot substitute for arguments no matter how pointed those questions may be so it’s important for presuppositionalists to present arguments in support of their claims and to ensure their critics are aware of those arguments so that they can be critically evaluated in that spirit i thought it would be useful to gather in one place my own presuppositional arguments as well as my attempts to explain or reconstruct the arguments of other presuppositionalists if knowledge then god  — a paper in which i summarize van til’s transcendental argument actually multiple versions of it and contrast it with the theistic arguments of alvin plantinga the theistic preconditions of knowledge  — an argument that human knowledge presupposes the existence of god presuppositionalism and frame’s epistemology  — an essay on john frame’s distinctive contributions to epistemology and apologetics in which i sketch out in the final section a triperspectival presuppositional critique of naturalism the lord of noncontradiction  — an article coauthored with greg welty which argues for the existence of god from the laws of logic in defense of the argument for god from logic  — our responses to several critiques of the argument in the previous article antitheism presupposes theism  — a defense of van til’s provocative claim which extends the argument for god from logic into an argument for god from any belief stance including agnosticism atheism amoralism and arationalism  — the outline of an argument to the effect that atheism cannot account for objective rationality in addition my book why should i believe christianity offers a broadly presuppositional and evidential case for the biblical christian worldview →  comments posted in apologetics tagged cornelius van til john frame presuppositionalism tag transcendental argument yes molina there could have been a santa claus posted on  january    comment consider this post a sidebar to the ongoing series on molinism it draws on some recent comments by william lane craig arguably the leading evangelical defender of molinism in response to a reader’s question bold added first i don’t claim that “universal salvation is impossible because of free will” the point here is subtle and easily misunderstood i think that there certainly are logically possible worlds in which everyone freely places his faith in christ and so is saved what i’ve said is that for all we know such worlds may not be feasible for god to actualize or if some are they may have overriding deficiencies that make them less preferable the point here is that god’s being omnipotent does not entail that he can actualize just any logically possible world for the persons in those worlds were god to try to actualize them might freely choose to reject god we can grasp this point by realizing that which world is actual isn’t up to god alone free creatures are coactualizers of the world along with god by means of their free choices which god does not determine so it may not be feasible for god to actualize a world of free universal salvation without overriding deficiencies craig is exactly right that on the molinist view “which possible world is actual isn’t up to god alone” god determines some contingent truths while his creatures determine other contingent truths by their libertarian free choices god only ‘weakly’ actualizes this world he ‘strongly’ actualizes many aspects of the world eg causally determining the circumstances in which free creatures will make their choices but god doesn’t causally determine those choices rather by way of his middle knowledge god knows infallibly what free choices his creatures would make in those circumstances and thus by ‘strongly’ actualizing those circumstances god ‘weakly’ actualizes the world in its entirety even so as craig puts it we are “coactualizers” of the world because the actuality of this world depends both on god’s free choices and on ours this model of divine providence has proven attractive to many christian thinkers partly because of its prospects for theodicy if the actualities of this world aren’t entirely “up to god” then perhaps god can’t be held morally responsible for the fact that some aspects of this world are less than ideal eg not all creatures are saved however i think the way craig puts matters in the quotation above conceals some of the oddities of the molinist’s position craig makes it sound as though which possible world is actualized is “up to” both god and us based on the actual free choices that we all make but this is misleading for two closely related reasons continue reading → →  comment posted in philosophy theology tagged middle knowledge molinism santa claus william lane craig the internal testimony of the holy spirit posted on  january    comment the following article was published in the christian research journal   thanks to cri for permission to post it here how do you know that the bible is god’s word if you’re a regular reader of the christian research journal i suspect that question immediately prompts you to think of arguments and evidences for the divine inspiration of the bible take for example the fulfilled biblical prophecies the astonishing consistency and unity of the bible’s message despite having many human authors over hundreds of years and the testimony of jesus who confirmed his claim to be the son of god by his resurrection from the dead those would be good thoughts but there’s a problem with answering the question in that way if a christian’s knowledge that the bible is god’s word depends on being able to marshal various arguments and evidences then surely only a small minority of christians actually know that the bible is god’s word the majority of christians may believe it but they don’t know it simply because they’re not familiar with these apologetic evidences they’ve never been asked to justify their beliefs in that way and they wouldn’t know how to do it if they were asked obviously it would be very unfortunate if it turned out that most christians don’t actually know that christianity is true it also seems quite implausible take my late grandmother for example her christian faith towered over mine should i conclude that i knew something she didn’t — namely that the bible she built her life on is indeed god’s word — because she wasn’t able to marshal arguments and evidences in the way that i can continue reading → →  comment posted in apologetics
