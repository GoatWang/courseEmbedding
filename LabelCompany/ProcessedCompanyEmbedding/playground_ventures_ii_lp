former google exec andy rubin that sits alongside an eponymous incubatorstartup studio and is making some big bets in areas like artificial intelligence and new generations of hardware– is raising more money a form d filed with the sec notes that playground ventures is in the process of adding another  million into its coffers the filing notes that none of the sum has yet to be raised relatively speaking  million a modest figure since  it looks like the playground group which includes the playground global incubator and playground ventures has disclosed about  million in funding as part of a projected  million fundraise and what appears to be a bigger plan to raise  million we have contacted the company to ask if it can elaborate more on whether this  million is one more segment in that wider effort or if it is for another different purpose specifically this latest funding is for “playground ventures affiliates ii” two previous playground ventures filings at the sec include playground ventures which is from  and covers the  million raise and playground ventures ii which dates from november  and is the filing to raise  million we’ll update this as we learn more notably en route to raising  million to date playground has picked up a number of strategic backers like google hp and foxconn which together with others put in  million towards the running total why everyone likes to back a winning team and by virtue of rubin’s experience with android and google and the impressive backgrounds of others on the team including the creator of quicktime the cocreator of danger the creator of the first big video codec and many others playground has one of the best track records around and getting involved at the lp level gives these companies a chance to work early on with
