concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material watson earned degrees at the university of chicago bs  and indiana university phd  following a postdoctoral year at the university of copenhagen with herman kalckar and ole maaloe later watson worked at the university of cambridges cavendish laboratory in england where he first met his future collaborator and friend francis crick from  to  watson was on the faculty of the harvard university biology department promoting research in molecular biology from  he served as director of

watson was born in chicago illinois on april   as the only son of jean mitchell and james d watson a businessman descended mostly from colonial english immigrants to america his mothers father lauchlin mitchell a tailor was from glasgow scotland and her mother lizzie gleason was the child of irish parents from tipperary raised catholic he later described himself as an escapee from the catholic religion watson said the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didnt believe in god watson grew up on the south side of chicago and attended public schools including horace mann grammar school and south shore high school he was fascinated with bird watching a hobby shared with his father so he considered majoring in ornithology watson appeared on quiz kids a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions thanks to the liberal policy of university president robert hutchins he enrolled at the university of chicago where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of  after reading erwin schrödingers book what is life in  watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics watson earned his bs degree in zoology from the university of chicago in  in his autobiography avoid boring people watson described the university of chicago as an idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth in contrast to his description of later experiences in  watson left the university of chicago to become a graduate student at indiana university attracted by the presence at bloomington of the  nobel prize winner hermann joseph muller who in crucial papers published in   and in the s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that schrödinger presented in his  book he received his phd degree from indiana university in  salvador luria was his doctoral advisor career and researchedit luria delbrück and the phage groupedit originally watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of salvador luria luria eventually shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his work on the luria–delbrück experiment which concerned the nature of genetic mutations he was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages he and max delbrück were among the leaders of this new phage group an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as drosophila towards microbial genetics early in  watson began his phd research in lurias laboratory at indiana university that spring he met delbrück first in lurias apartment and again that summer during watsons first trip to the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl the phage group was the intellectual medium where watson became a working scientist importantly the members of the phage group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene in  watson took a course with felix haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves the other major molecular component of chromosomes dna was widely considered to be a stupid tetranucleotide serving only a structural role to support the proteins however even at this early time watson under the influence of the phage group was aware of the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment which suggested that dna was the genetic molecule watsons research project involved using xrays to inactivate bacterial viruses watson then went to copenhagen university in september  for a year of postdoctoral research first heading to the laboratory of biochemist herman kalckar kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system watson however wanted to explore the structure of dna and his interests did not coincide with kalckars after working part of the year with kalckar watson spent the remainder of his time in copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist ole maaloe then a member of the phage group the experiments which watson had learned of during the previous summers cold spring harbor phage conference included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection the intention was to determine whether protein or dna was the genetic material but upon consultation with max delbrück they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as dna watson never developed a constructive interaction with kalckar but he did accompany kalckar to a meeting in italy where watson saw maurice wilkins talk about his xray diffraction data for dna watson was now certain that dna had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated in  the chemist linus pauling in california published his model of the amino acid alpha helix a result that grew out of paulings efforts in xray crystallography and molecular model building after obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at indiana university statens serum institut denmark cshl and the california institute of technology watson now had the desire to learn to perform xray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of dna that summer luria met john kendrew and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for watson in england in  watson visited the stazione zoologica anton dohrn in naples identifying the double helixedit dna model built by crick and watson in  on display in the science museum london in midmarch  using in part experimental data collected mainly by rosalind franklin and also by maurice wilkins watson and crick deduced the double helix structure of dna sir lawrence bragg the director of the cavendish laboratory where watson and crick worked made the original announcement of the discovery at a solvay conference on proteins in belgium on april   it went unreported by the press watson and crick submitted a paper entitled molecular structure of nucleic acids a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid to the scientific journal nature which was published on april   this has been described by some other biologists and nobel laureates as the most important scientific discovery of the th centurycitation needed bragg gave a talk at the guys hospital medical school in london on thursday may   which resulted in a may   article by ritchie calder in the london newspaper news chronicle entitled why you are you nearer secret of life sydney brenner jack dunitz dorothy hodgkin leslie orgel and beryl m oughton were some of the first people in april  to see the model of the structure of dna constructed by crick and watson at the time they were working at oxford universitys chemistry department all were impressed by the new dna model especially brenner who subsequently worked with crick at cambridge in the cavendish laboratory and the new laboratory of molecular biology according to the late beryl oughton later rimmer they all travelled together in two cars once dorothy hodgkin announced to them that they were off to cambridge to see the model of the structure of dna the cambridge university student newspaper varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on saturday may   watson subsequently presented a paper on the doublehelical structure of dna at the th cold spring harbor symposium on viruses in early june  six weeks after the publication of the watson and crick paper in nature many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery the  cold harbor symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the dna double helix watsons accomplishment is displayed on the monument at the american museum of natural history in new york city because the monument memorializes only american laureates francis crick and maurice wilkins who shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine are omitted watson crick and wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  for their research on the structure of nucleic acids rosalind franklin had died in  and was therefore ineligible for nomination the publication of the double helix structure of dna can be regarded as a turning point in science human understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began harvard universityedit in  watson accepted a position in the biology department at harvard university his work at harvard focused on rna and its role in the transfer of genetic information at harvard university watson achieved a series of academic promotions from assistant professor to associate professor to full professor of biology watson claimed however that he was refused a  raise in salary after winning the nobel prize he championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology stating that disciplines such as ecology developmental biology taxonomy physiology etc had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings going so far as to discourage their study by students watson continued to be a member of the harvard faculty until  even though he took over the directorship of cold spring harbor laboratory in  views on watsons scientific contributions while at harvard are somewhat mixed his most notable achievements in his two decades at harvard may be what he wrote about science rather than anything he discovered during that time watsons first textbook the molecular biology of the gene set a new standard for textbooks particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings his next textbook was molecular biology of the cell in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientistwriters his third textbook was recombinant dna which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function the textbooks are still in print publishing the double helixedit in  watson wrote the double helix listed by the board of the modern library as number seven in their list of  best nonfiction books the book details the sometimes painful story of not only the discovery of the structure of dna but also the personalities conflicts and controversy surrounding their work watsons original title was to have been honest jim in that the book recounts the discovery of the double helix from his point of view and included many of his private emotional impressions at the time some controversy surrounded the publication of the book watsons book was originally to be published by the harvard university press but francis crick and maurice wilkins objected among others watsons home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published cold spring harbor laboratoryedit external video james watson why society isnt ready for genomicbased medicine  chemical heritage foundation in  watson became the director of the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl between  and  the watsons two sons were born and by  the young family made cold spring harbor their permanent residence watson served as the laboratorys director and president for about  years and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus in his roles as director president and chancellor watson led cshl to articulate its presentday mission dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers neurological diseases and other causes of human suffering cshl substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under watson’s direction he is credited with transforming a small facility into one of the world’s great education and research institutions initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer in a retrospective summary of watsons accomplishments there bruce stillman the laboratorys president said jim watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science in october  watson was suspended following criticism of his views on genetic factors relating to intelligence and a week later on the th he retired at the age of  from cshl from what the lab called nearly  years of distinguished service in a statement watson attributed his retirement to his age and circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired human genome projectedit watson in  in  watson was appointed as the head of the human genome project at the national institutes of health a position he held until april   watson left the genome project after conflicts with the new nih director bernadine healy watson was opposed to healys attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences and any ownership of the laws of nature two years before stepping down from the genome project he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research he said the nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the worlds people as opposed to its nations he left within weeks of the  announcement that the nih would be applying for patents on brainspecific cdnas the issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the us by the us supreme court see association for molecular pathology v us patent and trademark office in  watson became president of cshl francis collins took over the role as director of the human genome project in  james watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online after it was presented to him on may   by  life sciences corporation in collaboration with scientists at the human genome sequencing center baylor college of medicine watson was quoted as saying i am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies role of oxidants in diseaseedit in  watson published a paper in the lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes dementia heart disease and cancer for example type  diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different a lack of biological oxidants not an excess and discusses this in detail one critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit and that the lancet published watsons paper only because of his name however other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression notable former studentsedit several of watsons former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including mario capecchi bob horvitz charles kurland peter d moore and joan steitz besides numerous phd students watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including ewan birney

chang yi wang he held the position for six years and retired from the board in  in january  watson accepted the invitation of leonor beleza president of the champalimaud foundation to become the head of the foundations scientific council an advisory organ watson has also been an institute adviser for the allen institute for brain science political activismedit during his tenure as a professor at harvard watson participated in several political protests vietnam war while a professor at harvard university watson along with  faculty members of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology including one other nobel prize winner spearheaded a resolution for the immediate withdrawal of us forces from vietnam nuclear proliferation and environmentalism in  on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima watson along with over  scientists and engineers spoke out against nuclear proliferation to president ford in part because of the lack of a proven method for the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste and because the writers of the declaration see the proliferation of nuclear plants as a major threat to american liberties and international safety because they say safeguard procedures are inadequate to prevent terrorist theft of commercial reactorproduced plutonium in  watson said i turned against the left wing because they dont like genetics because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes they want all failure in life to be due to the evil system controversiesedit use of kings college resultsedit an enduring controversy has been generated by watson and cricks unauthorized use of dna xray diffraction data collected by rosalind franklin and raymond gosling the controversy arose from the fact that some of franklins unpublished data were used without her consent by watson and crick in their construction of the double helix model of dna franklins experimental results provided estimates of the water content of dna crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugarphosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule franklin personally told crick and watson that the backbones had to be on the outside which was a crucial piece of information because before then linus pauling and watson and crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards her identification of the space group for dna crystals revealed to crick that the two dna strands were antiparallel the xray diffraction images collected by gosling and franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of dna franklins experimental work thus proved crucial in watson and cricks discovery watson and crick had three sources for franklins unpublished data  her  seminar attended by watson  discussions with wilkins who worked in the same laboratory with franklin  a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of medical research councilsupported laboratories watson crick wilkins and franklin all worked in mrc laboratories prior to publication of the double helix structure watson and crick had little interaction with franklin crick and watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with wilkins they offered him a coauthorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of dna wilkins turned down the offer a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at kings college in the eventual published paper rather than make any of the dna researchers at kings college coauthors on the watson and crick double helix article the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from kings college along with the helix paper according to one critic watsons portrayal of franklin in the double helix written after franklins death when libel laws did not apply anymore was negative and gave the appearance that she was wilkins assistant and was unable to interpret her own dna data the latter accusation was indefensible since eg franklin herself told crick and watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside which was crucial to the elucidation of the helix since before this both crick and watson and linus pauling had independently generated flawed models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards in his book the double helix watson described being intimidated by franklin and that they were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when franklin was doing dna research in the books epilogue written after franklins death watson acknowledges his early impressions of franklin were often wrong that she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science even though her work was superb and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate franklins generosity and integrity a review of the handwritten correspondence from franklin to watson located in the archives at cshl reveals that the two scientists later had exchanges of constructive scientific correspondence in fact franklin consulted with watson on her tobacco mosaic virus rna research franklins letters begin on friendly terms with dear jim and conclude with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as best wishes yours rosalind each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of dna in separate articles and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of nature these classic molecular

is on the base these strands unravel during cell reproduction genes are encoded in the sequence of bases the double helix model was supported by the work of rosalind franklin and maurice wilkins on the helices the structure of dna was discovered in  by francis crick and james watson while watson lived here at clare the molecule of dna has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs adenine  thymine or guanine  cytosine controversial commentsedit james watson february  watson has often expressed provocative concepts and disparaging opinions of others within the realm of genetic research he has been quoted in the sunday telegraph  as stating if you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesnt want a homosexual child well let her the biologist richard dawkins wrote a letter to the independent claiming that watsons position was misrepresented by the sunday telegraph article and that watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion to emphasise that watson is in favor of allowing choice on the issue of obesity watson has also been quoted as saying  whenever you interview fat people you feel bad because you know youre not going to hire them while speaking at a conference in  watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive hypothesizing that darkskinned people have stronger libidos his lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects sex drive thats why you have latin lovers he said according to people who attended the lecture youve never heard of an english lover only an english patient watson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews arguing that stupidity is a disease and the really stupid bottom  of people should be cured he has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered saying in  people say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty i think it would be great watson has had quite a few disagreements with craig venter regarding his use of est fragments while venter worked at nih venter went on to found celera genomics and continued his feud with watson watson was even quoted as calling venter hitler avoid boring people uk book tour and resignationedit watson signing autographs after a speech at cold spring harbor laboratory on april   in his memoir avoid boring people lessons from a life in science watson describes his academic colleagues as dinosaurs deadbeats fossils hasbeens mediocre and vapid steve shapin in harvard magazine noted that watson had written an unlikely book of manners telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientists career he wrote watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university e o wilson once described watson as the most unpleasant human being i had ever met but in a later tv interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at harvard old history when they had competed for funding in their respective fields in the epilogue to the memoir avoid boring people watson alternately attacks and defends former harvard university president lawrence summers who stepped down in  due in part to his remarks about women and science watson also states in the epilogue anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated in early october  watson was about to embark on a uk book tour to promote the memoir he was interviewed by charlotte huntgrubbe at cshl in  she had been a student there in a program in which watson recruited students to live at his family home and work at cshl for a year huntgrubbe had gone on to work for the sunday times magazine she was selected for the interview as she was one of the few women to have been mentored by him huntgrubbe broached the subject of whether race was a factor in his hypothesis of divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populationscitation needed the following is a transcript of that part of the interview he says that he is inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really and i know that this hot potato is going to be difficult to address his hope is that everyone is equal but he counters that people who have to deal with black employees find this not true he says that you should not discriminate on the basis of colour because there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level he writes that there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so though other publications noted that the paper had kept the profile sympathetic and placed the comments at the end of the piece the article was a public relations disaster for watson the sunday times magazine editor cathy galvin noted it was important the reader understood charlottes relationship with watson and her regard for him before exploring the explosive and unscientific territory of his opinions and history of statements about women race and abortion which have stirred so much controversy in the past watsons comments drew attention and criticism in the uk watson said his intention was to promote science not racism but some of the uk venues canceled his appearances watson canceled the rest of his tour because of the public controversy on october   the board of trustees at cold spring harbor laboratory suspended watsons administrative responsibilities on october  watson issued an apology on october  he resigned from his position as chancellor in  watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of cshl as of  he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory in a  bbc documentary watson said i have never thought of myself as a racist i dont see myself as a racist i am mortified by it it was the worst thing in my life some periodicals offered opinions on the matterclarification needed sale of nobel prize medaledit in  he decided to auction off his nobel prize medal in view of his diminished income after the  incident and to use part of the funds raised by the sale to support scientific research the medal sold at auction at christies in december  for us million watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in long island and to funding research at trinity college dublin watson is the first living recipient of the honor to auction the medal the medal was subsequently returned to watson by the purchaser russian tycoon alisher usmanov who stated that watson deserved the medal and that it was unacceptable that he should be compelled to sell it personal lifeedit watson is an atheist in  he was one of  nobel laureates who signed the humanist manifesto marriage and familyedit watson married elizabeth lewis in  they have two sons rufus robert watson b  and duncan james watson b  watson sometimes talks about his son rufus who suffers from schizophrenia he wants to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contribute to it awards and honorsedit watson has won numerous awards including james d watson with the othmer gold medal  albert lasker award

codiscoverers of the structure of dna in  with francis crick and rosalind franklin watson crick and maurice wilkins were awarded the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material watson earned degrees at the university of chicago bs  and indiana university phd  following a postdoctoral year at the university of copenhagen with herman kalckar and ole maaloe later watson worked at the university of cambridges cavendish laboratory in england where he first met his future collaborator and friend francis crick from  to  watson was on the faculty of the harvard university biology department promoting research in molecular biology from  he served as director of cold spring harbor laboratory cshl greatly expanding its level of funding and research at cshl he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology in  he started as president and served for  years he was then appointed chancellor serving until he resigned in  after making controversial comments claiming a link between intelligence and race between  and  watson was associated with the national institutes of health helping to establish the human genome project watson has written many science books including the

watson was born in chicago illinois on april   as the only son of jean mitchell and james d watson a businessman descended mostly from colonial english immigrants to america his mothers father lauchlin mitchell a tailor was from glasgow scotland and her mother lizzie gleason was the child of irish parents from tipperary raised catholic he later described himself as an escapee from the catholic religion watson said the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didnt believe in god watson grew up on the south side of chicago and attended public schools including horace mann grammar school and south shore high school he was fascinated with bird watching a hobby shared with his father so he considered majoring in ornithology watson appeared on quiz kids a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions thanks to the liberal policy of university president robert hutchins he enrolled at the university of chicago where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of  after reading erwin schrödingers book what is life in  watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics watson earned his bs degree in zoology from the university of chicago in  in his autobiography avoid boring people watson described the university of chicago as an idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth in contrast to his description of later experiences in  watson left the university of chicago to become a graduate student at indiana university attracted by the presence at bloomington of the  nobel prize winner hermann joseph muller who in crucial papers published in   and in the s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that schrödinger presented in his  book he received his phd degree from indiana university in  salvador luria was his doctoral advisor career and researchedit luria delbrück and the phage groupedit originally watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of salvador luria luria eventually shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his work on the luria–delbrück experiment which concerned the nature of genetic mutations he was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages he and max delbrück were among the leaders of this new phage group an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as drosophila towards microbial genetics early in  watson began his phd research in lurias laboratory at indiana university that spring he met delbrück first in lurias apartment and again that summer during watsons first trip to the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl the phage group was the intellectual medium where watson became a working scientist importantly the members of the phage group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene in  watson took a course with felix haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves the other major molecular component of chromosomes dna was widely considered to be a stupid tetranucleotide serving only a structural role to support the proteins however even at this early time watson under the influence of the phage group was aware of the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment which suggested that dna was the genetic molecule watsons research project involved using xrays to inactivate bacterial viruses watson then went to copenhagen university in september  for a year of postdoctoral research first heading to the laboratory of biochemist herman kalckar kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system watson however wanted to explore the structure of dna and his interests did not coincide with kalckars after working part of the year with kalckar watson spent the remainder of his time in copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist ole maaloe then a member of the phage group the experiments which watson had learned of during the previous summers cold spring harbor phage conference included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection the intention was to determine whether protein or dna was the genetic material but upon consultation with max delbrück they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as dna watson never developed a constructive interaction with kalckar but he did accompany kalckar to a meeting in italy where watson saw maurice wilkins talk about his xray diffraction data for dna watson was now certain that dna had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated in  the chemist linus pauling in california published his model of the amino acid alpha helix a result that grew out of paulings efforts in xray crystallography and molecular model building after obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at indiana university statens serum institut denmark cshl and the california institute of technology watson now had the desire to learn to perform xray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of dna that summer luria met john kendrew and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for watson in england in  watson visited the stazione zoologica anton dohrn in naples identifying the double helixedit dna model built by crick and watson in  on display in the science museum london in midmarch  using in part experimental data collected mainly by rosalind franklin and also by maurice wilkins watson and crick deduced the double helix structure of dna sir lawrence bragg the director of the cavendish laboratory where watson and crick worked made the original announcement of the discovery at a solvay conference on proteins in belgium on april   it went unreported by the press watson and crick submitted a paper entitled molecular structure of nucleic acids a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid to the scientific journal nature which was published on april   this has been described by some other biologists and nobel laureates as the most important scientific discovery of the th centurycitation needed bragg gave a talk at the guys hospital medical school in london on thursday may   which resulted in a may   article by ritchie calder in the london newspaper news chronicle entitled why you are you nearer secret of life sydney brenner jack dunitz dorothy hodgkin leslie orgel and beryl m oughton were some of the first people in april  to see the model of the structure of dna constructed by crick and watson at the time they were working at oxford universitys chemistry department all were impressed by the new dna model especially brenner who subsequently worked with crick at cambridge in the cavendish laboratory and the new laboratory of molecular biology according to the late beryl oughton later rimmer they all travelled together in two cars once dorothy hodgkin announced to them that they were off to cambridge to see the model of the structure of dna the cambridge university student newspaper varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on saturday may   watson subsequently presented a paper on the doublehelical structure of dna at the th cold spring harbor symposium on viruses in early june  six weeks after the publication of the watson and crick paper in nature many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery the  cold harbor symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the dna double helix watsons accomplishment is displayed on the monument at the american museum of natural history in new york city because the monument memorializes only american laureates francis crick and maurice wilkins who shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine are omitted watson crick and wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  for their research on the structure of nucleic acids rosalind franklin had died in  and was therefore ineligible for nomination the publication of the double helix structure of dna can be regarded as a turning point in science human understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began harvard universityedit in  watson accepted a position in the biology department at harvard university his work at harvard focused on rna and its role in the transfer of genetic information at harvard university watson achieved a series of academic promotions from assistant professor to associate professor to full professor of biology watson claimed however that he was refused a  raise in salary after winning the nobel prize he championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology stating that disciplines such as ecology developmental biology taxonomy physiology etc had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings going so far as to discourage their study by students watson continued to be a member of the harvard faculty until  even though he took over the directorship of cold spring harbor laboratory in  views on watsons scientific contributions while at harvard are somewhat mixed his most notable achievements in his two decades at harvard may be what he wrote about science rather than anything he discovered during that time watsons first textbook the molecular biology of the gene set a new standard for textbooks particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings his next textbook was molecular biology of the cell in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientistwriters his third textbook was recombinant dna which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function the textbooks are still in print publishing the double helixedit in  watson wrote the double helix listed by the board of the modern library as number seven in their list of  best nonfiction books the book details the sometimes painful story of not only the discovery of the structure of dna but also the personalities conflicts and controversy surrounding their work watsons original title was to have been honest jim in that the book recounts the discovery of the double helix from his point of view and included many of his private emotional impressions at the time some controversy surrounded the publication of the book watsons book was originally to be published by the harvard university press but francis crick and maurice wilkins objected among others watsons home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published cold spring harbor laboratoryedit external video james watson why society isnt ready for genomicbased medicine  chemical heritage foundation in  watson became the director of the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl between  and  the watsons two sons were born and by  the young family made cold spring harbor their permanent residence watson served as the laboratorys director and president for about  years and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus in his roles as director president and chancellor watson led cshl to articulate its presentday mission dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers neurological diseases and other causes of human suffering cshl substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under watson’s direction he is credited with transforming a small facility into one of the world’s great education and research institutions initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer in a retrospective summary of watsons accomplishments there bruce stillman the laboratorys president said jim watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science in october  watson was suspended following criticism of his views on genetic factors relating to intelligence and a week later on the th he retired at the age of  from cshl from what the lab called nearly  years of distinguished service in a statement watson attributed his retirement to his age and circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired human genome projectedit watson in  in  watson was appointed as the head of the human genome project at the national institutes of health a position he held until april   watson left the genome project after conflicts with the new nih director bernadine healy watson was opposed to healys attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences and any ownership of the laws of nature two years before stepping down from the genome project he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research he said the nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the worlds people as opposed to its nations he left within weeks of the  announcement that the nih would be applying for patents on brainspecific cdnas the issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the us by the us supreme court see association for molecular pathology v us patent and trademark office in  watson became president of cshl francis collins took over the role as director of the human genome project in  james watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online after it was presented to him on may   by  life sciences corporation in collaboration with scientists at the human genome sequencing center baylor college of medicine watson was quoted as saying i am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies role of oxidants in diseaseedit in  watson published a paper in the lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes dementia heart disease and cancer for example type  diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different a lack of biological oxidants not an excess and discusses this in detail one critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit and that the lancet published watsons paper only because of his name however other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression notable former studentsedit several of watsons former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including mario capecchi bob horvitz charles kurland peter d moore and joan steitz besides numerous phd students watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including ewan birney

chang yi wang he held the position for six years and retired from the board in  in january  watson accepted the invitation of leonor beleza president of the champalimaud foundation to become the head of the foundations scientific council an advisory organ watson has also been an institute adviser for the allen institute for brain science political activismedit during his tenure as a professor at harvard watson participated in several political protests vietnam war while a professor at harvard university watson along with  faculty members of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology including one other nobel prize winner spearheaded a resolution for the immediate withdrawal of us forces from vietnam nuclear proliferation and environmentalism in  on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima watson along with over  scientists and engineers spoke out against nuclear proliferation to president ford in part because of the lack of a proven method for the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste and because the writers of the declaration see the proliferation of nuclear plants as a major threat to american liberties and international safety because they say safeguard procedures are inadequate to prevent terrorist theft of commercial reactorproduced plutonium in  watson said i turned against the left wing because they dont like genetics because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes they want all failure in life to be due to the evil system controversiesedit use of kings college resultsedit an enduring controversy has been generated by watson and cricks unauthorized use of dna xray diffraction data collected by rosalind franklin and raymond gosling the controversy arose from the fact that some of franklins unpublished data were used without her consent by watson and crick in their construction of the double helix model of dna franklins experimental results provided estimates of the water content of dna crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugarphosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule franklin personally told crick and watson that the backbones had to be on the outside which was a crucial piece of information because before then linus pauling and watson and crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards her identification of the space group for dna crystals revealed to crick that the two dna strands were antiparallel the xray diffraction images collected by gosling and franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of dna franklins experimental work thus proved crucial in watson and cricks discovery watson and crick had three sources for franklins unpublished data  her  seminar attended by watson  discussions with wilkins who worked in the same laboratory with franklin  a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of medical research councilsupported laboratories watson crick wilkins and franklin all worked in mrc laboratories prior to publication of the double helix structure watson and crick had little interaction with franklin crick and watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with wilkins they offered him a coauthorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of dna wilkins turned down the offer a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at kings college in the eventual published paper rather than make any of the dna researchers at kings college coauthors on the watson and crick double helix article the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from kings college along with the helix paper according to one critic watsons portrayal of franklin in the double helix written after franklins death when libel laws did not apply anymore was negative and gave the appearance that she was wilkins assistant and was unable to interpret her own dna data the latter accusation was indefensible since eg franklin herself told crick and watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside which was crucial to the elucidation of the helix since before this both crick and watson and linus pauling had independently generated flawed models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards in his book the double helix watson described being intimidated by franklin and that they were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when franklin was doing dna research in the books epilogue written after franklins death watson acknowledges his early impressions of franklin were often wrong that she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science even though her work was superb and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate franklins generosity and integrity a review of the handwritten correspondence from franklin to watson located in the archives at cshl reveals that the two scientists later had exchanges of constructive scientific correspondence in fact franklin consulted with watson on her tobacco mosaic virus rna research franklins letters begin on friendly terms with dear jim and conclude with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as best wishes yours rosalind each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of dna in separate articles and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of nature these classic molecular

is on the base these strands unravel during cell reproduction genes are encoded in the sequence of bases the double helix model was supported by the work of rosalind franklin and maurice wilkins on the helices the structure of dna was discovered in  by francis crick and james watson while watson lived here at clare the molecule of dna has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs adenine  thymine or guanine  cytosine controversial commentsedit james watson february  watson has often expressed provocative concepts and disparaging opinions of others within the realm of genetic research he has been quoted in the sunday telegraph  as stating if you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesnt want a homosexual child well let her the biologist richard dawkins wrote a letter to the independent claiming that watsons position was misrepresented by the sunday telegraph article and that watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion to emphasise that watson is in favor of allowing choice on the issue of obesity watson has also been quoted as saying  whenever you interview fat people you feel bad because you know youre not going to hire them while speaking at a conference in  watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive hypothesizing that darkskinned people have stronger libidos his lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects sex drive thats why you have latin lovers he said according to people who attended the lecture youve never heard of an english lover only an english patient watson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews arguing that stupidity is a disease and the really stupid bottom  of people should be cured he has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered saying in  people say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty i think it would be great watson has had quite a few disagreements with craig venter regarding his use of est fragments while venter worked at nih venter went on to found celera genomics and continued his feud with watson watson was even quoted as calling venter hitler avoid boring people uk book tour and resignationedit watson signing autographs after a speech at cold spring harbor laboratory on april   in his memoir avoid boring people lessons from a life in science watson describes his academic colleagues as dinosaurs deadbeats fossils hasbeens mediocre and vapid steve shapin in harvard magazine noted that watson had written an unlikely book of manners telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientists career he wrote watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university e o wilson once described watson as the most unpleasant human being i had ever met but in a later tv interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at harvard old history when they had competed for funding in their respective fields in the epilogue to the memoir avoid boring people watson alternately attacks and defends former harvard university president lawrence summers who stepped down in  due in part to his remarks about women and science watson also states in the epilogue anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated in early october  watson was about to embark on a uk book tour to promote the memoir he was interviewed by charlotte huntgrubbe at cshl in  she had been a student there in a program in which watson recruited students to live at his family home and work at cshl for a year huntgrubbe had gone on to work for the sunday times magazine she was selected for the interview as she was one of the few women to have been mentored by him huntgrubbe broached the subject of whether race was a factor in his hypothesis of divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populationscitation needed the following is a transcript of that part of the interview he says that he is inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really and i know that this hot potato is going to be difficult to address his hope is that everyone is equal but he counters that people who have to deal with black employees find this not true he says that you should not discriminate on the basis of colour because there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level he writes that there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so though other publications noted that the paper had kept the profile sympathetic and placed the comments at the end of the piece the article was a public relations disaster for watson the sunday times magazine editor cathy galvin noted it was important the reader understood charlottes relationship with watson and her regard for him before exploring the explosive and unscientific territory of his opinions and history of statements about women race and abortion which have stirred so much controversy in the past watsons comments drew attention and criticism in the uk watson said his intention was to promote science not racism but some of the uk venues canceled his appearances watson canceled the rest of his tour because of the public controversy on october   the board of trustees at cold spring harbor laboratory suspended watsons administrative responsibilities on october  watson issued an apology on october  he resigned from his position as chancellor in  watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of cshl as of  he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory in a  bbc documentary watson said i have never thought of myself as a racist i dont see myself as a racist i am mortified by it it was the worst thing in my life some periodicals offered opinions on the matterclarification needed sale of nobel prize medaledit in  he decided to auction

codiscoverers of the structure of dna in  with francis crick and rosalind franklin watson crick and maurice wilkins were awarded the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material watson earned degrees at the university of chicago bs  and indiana university phd  following a postdoctoral year at the university of copenhagen with herman kalckar and ole maaloe later watson worked at the university of cambridges cavendish laboratory in england where he first met his future collaborator and friend francis crick from  to  watson was on the faculty of the harvard university biology department promoting research in molecular biology from  he served as director of cold spring harbor laboratory cshl greatly expanding its level of funding and research at cshl he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology in  he started as president and served for  years he was then appointed chancellor serving until he resigned in  after making controversial comments claiming a link between intelligence and race between  and  watson was associated with the national institutes of health helping to establish the human genome project watson has written many science books including the

watson was born in chicago illinois on april   as the only son of jean mitchell and james d watson a businessman descended mostly from colonial english immigrants to america his mothers father lauchlin mitchell a tailor was from glasgow scotland and her mother lizzie gleason was the child of irish parents from tipperary raised catholic he later described himself as an escapee from the catholic religion watson said the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didnt believe in god watson grew up on the south side of chicago and attended public schools including horace mann grammar school and south shore high school he was fascinated with bird watching a hobby shared with his father so he considered majoring in ornithology watson appeared on quiz kids a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions thanks to the liberal policy of university president robert hutchins he enrolled at the university of chicago where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of  after reading erwin schrödingers book what is life in  watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics watson earned his bs degree in zoology from the university of chicago in  in his autobiography avoid boring people watson described the university of chicago as an idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth in contrast to his description of later experiences in  watson left the university of chicago to become a graduate student at indiana university attracted by the presence at bloomington of the  nobel prize winner hermann joseph muller who in crucial papers published in   and in the s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that schrödinger presented in his  book he received his phd degree from indiana university in  salvador luria was his doctoral advisor career and researchedit luria delbrück and the phage groupedit originally watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of salvador luria luria eventually shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his work on the luria–delbrück experiment which concerned the nature of genetic mutations he was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages he and max delbrück were among the leaders of this new phage group an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as drosophila towards microbial genetics early in  watson began his phd research in lurias laboratory at indiana university that spring he met delbrück first in lurias apartment and again that summer during watsons first trip to the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl the phage group was the intellectual medium where watson became a working scientist importantly the members of the phage group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene in  watson took a course with felix haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves the other major molecular component of chromosomes dna was widely considered to be a stupid tetranucleotide serving only a structural role to support the proteins however even at this early time watson under the influence of the phage group was aware of the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment which suggested that dna was the genetic molecule watsons research project involved using xrays to inactivate bacterial viruses watson then went to copenhagen university in september  for a year of postdoctoral research first heading to the laboratory of biochemist herman kalckar kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system watson however wanted to explore the structure of dna and his interests did not coincide with kalckars after working part of the year with kalckar watson spent the remainder of his time in copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist ole maaloe then a member of the phage group the experiments which watson had learned of during the previous summers cold spring harbor phage conference included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection the intention was to determine whether protein or dna was the genetic material but upon consultation with max delbrück they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as dna watson never developed a constructive interaction with kalckar but he did accompany kalckar to a meeting in italy where watson saw maurice wilkins talk about his xray diffraction data for dna watson was now certain that dna had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated in  the chemist linus pauling in california published his model of the amino acid alpha helix a result that grew out of paulings efforts in xray crystallography and molecular model building after obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at indiana university statens serum institut denmark cshl and the california institute of technology watson now had the desire to learn to perform xray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of dna that summer luria met john kendrew and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for watson in england in  watson visited the stazione zoologica anton dohrn in naples identifying the double helixedit dna model built by crick and watson in  on display in the science museum london in midmarch  using in part experimental data collected mainly by rosalind franklin and also by maurice wilkins watson and crick deduced the double helix structure of dna sir lawrence bragg the director of the cavendish laboratory where watson and crick worked made the original announcement of the discovery at a solvay conference on proteins in belgium on april   it went unreported by the press watson and crick submitted a paper entitled molecular structure of nucleic acids a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid to the scientific journal nature which was published on april   this has been described by some other biologists and nobel laureates as the most important scientific discovery of the th centurycitation needed bragg gave a talk at the guys hospital medical school in london on thursday may   which resulted in a may   article by ritchie calder in the london newspaper news chronicle entitled why you are you nearer secret of life sydney brenner jack dunitz dorothy hodgkin leslie orgel and beryl m oughton were some of the first people in april  to see the model of the structure of dna constructed by crick and watson at the time they were working at oxford universitys chemistry department all were impressed by the new dna model especially brenner who subsequently worked with crick at cambridge in the cavendish laboratory and the new laboratory of molecular biology according to the late beryl oughton later rimmer they all travelled together in two cars once dorothy hodgkin announced to them that they were off to cambridge to see the model of the structure of dna the cambridge university student newspaper varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on saturday may   watson subsequently presented a paper on the doublehelical structure of dna at the th cold spring harbor symposium on viruses in early june  six weeks after the publication of the watson and crick paper in nature many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery the  cold harbor symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the dna double helix watsons accomplishment is displayed on the monument at the american museum of natural history in new york city because the monument memorializes only american laureates francis crick and maurice wilkins who shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine are omitted watson crick and wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  for their research on the structure of nucleic acids rosalind franklin had died in  and was therefore ineligible for nomination the publication of the double helix structure of dna can be regarded as a turning point in science human understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began harvard universityedit in  watson accepted a position in the biology department at harvard university his work at harvard focused on rna and its role in the transfer of genetic information at harvard university watson achieved a series of academic promotions from assistant professor to associate professor to full professor of biology watson claimed however that he was refused a  raise in salary after winning the nobel prize he championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology stating that disciplines such as ecology developmental biology taxonomy physiology etc had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings going so far as to discourage their study by students watson continued to be a member of the harvard faculty until  even though he took over the directorship of cold spring harbor laboratory in  views on watsons scientific contributions while at harvard are somewhat mixed his most notable achievements in his two decades at harvard may be what he wrote about science rather than anything he discovered during that time watsons first textbook the molecular biology of the gene set a new standard for textbooks particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings his next textbook was molecular biology of the cell in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientistwriters his third textbook was recombinant dna which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function the textbooks are still in print publishing the double helixedit in  watson wrote the double helix listed by the board of the modern library as number seven in their list of  best nonfiction books the book details the sometimes painful story of not only the discovery of the structure of dna but also the personalities conflicts and controversy surrounding their work watsons original title was to have been honest jim in that the book recounts the discovery of the double helix from his point of view and included many of his private emotional impressions at the time some controversy surrounded the publication of the book watsons book was originally to be published by the harvard university press but francis crick and maurice wilkins objected among others watsons home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published cold spring harbor laboratoryedit external video james watson why society isnt ready for genomicbased medicine  chemical heritage foundation in  watson became the director of the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl between  and  the watsons two sons were born and by  the young family made cold spring harbor their permanent residence watson served as the laboratorys director and president for about  years and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus in his roles as director president and chancellor watson led cshl to articulate its presentday mission dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers neurological diseases and other causes of human suffering cshl substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under watson’s direction he is credited with transforming a small facility into one of the world’s great education and research institutions initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer in a retrospective summary of watsons accomplishments there bruce stillman the laboratorys president said jim watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science in october  watson was suspended following criticism of his views on genetic factors relating to intelligence and a week later on the th he retired at the age of  from cshl from what the lab called nearly  years of distinguished service in a statement watson attributed his retirement to his age and circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired human genome projectedit watson in  in  watson was appointed as the head of the human genome project at the national institutes of health a position he held until april   watson left the genome project after conflicts with the new nih director bernadine healy watson was opposed to healys attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences and any ownership of the laws of nature two years before stepping down from the genome project he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research he said the nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the worlds people as opposed to its nations he left within weeks of the  announcement that the nih would be applying for patents on brainspecific cdnas the issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the us by the us supreme court see association for molecular pathology v us patent and trademark office in  watson became president of cshl francis collins took over the role as director of the human genome project in  james watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online after it was presented to him on may   by  life sciences corporation in collaboration with scientists at the human genome sequencing center baylor college of medicine watson was quoted as saying i am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies role of oxidants in diseaseedit in  watson published a paper in the lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes dementia heart disease and cancer for example type  diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different a lack of biological oxidants not an excess and discusses this in detail one critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit and that the lancet published watsons paper only because of his name however other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression notable former studentsedit several of watsons former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including mario capecchi bob horvitz charles kurland peter d moore and joan steitz besides numerous phd students watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including ewan birney

of the foundations scientific council an advisory organ watson has also been an institute adviser for the allen institute for brain science political activismedit during his tenure as a professor at harvard watson participated in several political protests vietnam war while a professor at harvard university watson along with  faculty members of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology including one other nobel prize winner spearheaded a resolution for the immediate withdrawal of us forces from vietnam nuclear proliferation and environmentalism in  on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima watson along with over  scientists and engineers spoke out against nuclear proliferation to president ford in part because of the lack of a proven method for the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste and because the writers of the declaration see the proliferation of nuclear plants as a major threat to american liberties and international safety because they say safeguard procedures are inadequate to prevent terrorist theft of commercial reactorproduced plutonium in  watson said i turned against the left wing because they dont like genetics because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes they want all failure in life to be due to the evil system controversiesedit use of kings college resultsedit an enduring controversy has been generated by watson and cricks unauthorized use of dna xray diffraction data collected by rosalind franklin and raymond gosling the controversy arose from the fact that some of franklins unpublished data were used without her consent by watson and crick in their construction of the double helix model of dna franklins experimental results provided estimates of the water content of dna crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugarphosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule franklin personally told crick and watson that the backbones had to be on the outside which was a crucial piece of information because before then linus pauling and watson and crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards her identification of the space group for dna crystals revealed to crick that the two dna strands were antiparallel the xray diffraction images collected by gosling and franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of dna franklins experimental work thus proved crucial in watson and cricks discovery watson and crick had three sources for franklins unpublished data  her  seminar attended by watson  discussions with wilkins who worked in the same laboratory with franklin  a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of medical research councilsupported laboratories watson crick wilkins and franklin all worked in mrc laboratories prior to publication of the double helix structure watson and crick had little interaction with franklin crick and watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with wilkins they offered him a coauthorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of dna wilkins turned down the offer a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at kings college in the eventual published paper rather than make any of the dna researchers at kings college coauthors on the watson and crick double helix article the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from kings college along with the helix paper according to one critic watsons portrayal of franklin in the double helix written after franklins death when libel laws did not apply anymore was negative and gave the appearance that she was wilkins assistant and was unable to interpret her own dna data the latter accusation was indefensible since eg franklin herself told crick and watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside which was crucial to the elucidation of the helix since before this both crick and watson and linus pauling had independently generated flawed models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards in his book the double helix watson described being intimidated by franklin and that they were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when franklin was doing dna research in the books epilogue written after franklins death watson acknowledges his early impressions of franklin were often wrong that she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science even though her work was superb and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate franklins generosity and integrity a review of the handwritten correspondence from franklin to watson located in the archives at cshl reveals that the two scientists later had exchanges of constructive scientific correspondence in fact franklin consulted with watson on her tobacco mosaic virus rna research franklins letters begin on friendly terms with dear jim and conclude with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as best wishes yours rosalind each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of dna in separate articles and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of nature these classic molecular

the helices the structure of dna was discovered in  by francis crick and james watson while watson lived here at clare the molecule of dna has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs adenine  thymine or guanine  cytosine controversial commentsedit james watson february  watson has often expressed provocative concepts and disparaging opinions of others within the realm of genetic research he has been quoted in the sunday telegraph  as stating if you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesnt want a homosexual child well let her the biologist richard dawkins wrote a letter to the independent claiming that watsons position was misrepresented by the sunday telegraph article and that watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion to emphasise that watson is in favor of allowing choice on the issue of obesity watson has also been quoted as saying  whenever you interview fat people you feel bad because you know youre not going to hire them while speaking at a conference in  watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive hypothesizing that darkskinned people have stronger libidos his lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects sex drive thats why you have latin lovers he said according to people who attended the lecture youve never heard of an english lover only an english patient watson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews arguing that stupidity is a disease and the really stupid bottom  of people should be cured he has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered saying in  people say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty i think it would be great watson has had quite a few disagreements with craig venter regarding his use of est fragments while venter worked at nih venter went on to found celera genomics and continued his feud with watson watson was even quoted as calling venter hitler avoid boring people uk book tour and resignationedit watson signing autographs after a speech at cold spring harbor laboratory on april   in his memoir avoid boring people lessons from a life in science watson describes his academic colleagues as dinosaurs deadbeats fossils hasbeens mediocre and vapid steve shapin in harvard magazine noted that watson had written an unlikely book of manners telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientists career he wrote watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university e o wilson once described watson as the most unpleasant human being i had ever met but in a later tv interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at harvard old history when they had competed for funding in their respective fields in the epilogue to the memoir avoid boring people watson alternately attacks and defends former harvard university president lawrence summers who stepped down in  due in part to his remarks about women and science watson also states in the epilogue anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated in early october  watson was about to embark on a uk book tour to promote the memoir he was interviewed by charlotte huntgrubbe at cshl in  she had been a student there in a program in which watson recruited students to live at his family home and work at cshl for a year huntgrubbe had gone on to work for the sunday times magazine she was selected for the interview as she was one of the few women to have been mentored by him huntgrubbe broached the subject of whether race was a factor in his hypothesis of divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populationscitation needed the following is a transcript of that part of the interview he says that he is inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really and i know that this hot potato is going to be difficult to address his hope is that everyone is equal but he counters that people who have to deal with black employees find this not true he says that you should not discriminate on the basis of colour because there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level he writes that there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so though other publications noted that the paper had kept the profile sympathetic and placed the comments at the end of the piece the article was a public relations disaster for watson the sunday times magazine editor cathy galvin noted it was important the reader understood charlottes relationship with watson and her regard for him before exploring the explosive and unscientific territory of his opinions and history of statements about women race and abortion which have stirred so much controversy in the past watsons comments drew attention and criticism in the uk watson said his intention was to promote science not racism but some of the uk venues canceled his appearances watson canceled the rest of his tour because of the public controversy on october   the board of trustees at cold spring harbor laboratory suspended watsons administrative responsibilities on october  watson issued an apology on october  he resigned from his position as chancellor in  watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of cshl as of  he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory in a  bbc documentary watson said i have never thought of myself as a racist i dont see myself as a racist i am mortified by it it was the worst thing in my life some periodicals offered opinions on the matterclarification needed sale of nobel prize medaledit in  he decided to auction

codiscoverers of the structure of dna in  with francis crick and rosalind franklin watson crick and maurice wilkins were awarded the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material watson earned degrees at the university of chicago bs  and indiana university phd  following a postdoctoral year at the university of copenhagen with herman kalckar and ole maaloe later watson worked at the university of cambridges cavendish laboratory in england where he first met his future collaborator and friend francis crick from  to  watson was on the faculty of the harvard university biology department promoting research in molecular biology from  he served as director of cold spring harbor laboratory cshl greatly expanding its level of funding and research at cshl he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology in  he started as president and served for  years he was then appointed chancellor serving until he resigned in  after making controversial comments claiming a link between intelligence and race between  and  watson was associated with the national institutes of health helping to establish the human genome project watson has written many science books including the

watson was born in chicago illinois on april   as the only son of jean mitchell and james d watson a businessman descended mostly from colonial english immigrants to america his mothers father lauchlin mitchell a tailor was from glasgow scotland and her mother lizzie gleason was the child of irish parents from tipperary raised catholic he later described himself as an escapee from the catholic religion watson said the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didnt believe in god watson grew up on the south side of chicago and attended public schools including horace mann grammar school and south shore high school he was fascinated with bird watching a hobby shared with his father so he considered majoring in ornithology watson appeared on quiz kids a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions thanks to the liberal policy of university president robert hutchins he enrolled at the university of chicago where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of  after reading erwin schrödingers book what is life in  watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics watson earned his bs degree in zoology from the university of chicago in  in his autobiography avoid boring people watson described the university of chicago as an idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth in contrast to his description of later experiences in  watson left the university of chicago to become a graduate student at indiana university attracted by the presence at bloomington of the  nobel prize winner hermann joseph muller who in crucial papers published in   and in the s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that schrödinger presented in his  book he received his phd degree from indiana university in  salvador luria was his doctoral advisor career and researchedit luria delbrück and the phage groupedit originally watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of salvador luria luria eventually shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his work on the luria–delbrück experiment which concerned the nature of genetic mutations he was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages he and max delbrück were among the leaders of this new phage group an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as drosophila towards microbial genetics early in  watson began his phd research in lurias laboratory at indiana university that spring he met delbrück first in lurias apartment and again that summer during watsons first trip to the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl the phage group was the intellectual medium where watson became a working scientist importantly the members of the phage group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene in  watson took a course with felix haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves the other major molecular component of chromosomes dna was widely considered to be a stupid tetranucleotide serving only a structural role to support the proteins however even at this early time watson under the influence of the phage group was aware of the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment which suggested that dna was the genetic molecule watsons research project involved using xrays to inactivate bacterial viruses watson then went to copenhagen university in september  for a year of postdoctoral research first heading to the laboratory of biochemist herman kalckar kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system watson however wanted to explore the structure of dna and his interests did not coincide with kalckars after working part of the year with kalckar watson spent the remainder of his time in copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist ole maaloe then a member of the phage group the experiments which watson had learned of during the previous summers cold spring harbor phage conference included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection the intention was to determine whether protein or dna was the genetic material but upon consultation with max delbrück they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as dna watson never developed a constructive interaction with kalckar but he did accompany kalckar to a meeting in italy where watson saw maurice wilkins talk about his xray diffraction data for dna watson was now certain that dna had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated in  the chemist linus pauling in california published his model of the amino acid alpha helix a result that grew out of paulings efforts in xray crystallography and molecular model building after obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at indiana university statens serum institut denmark cshl and the california institute of technology watson now had the desire to learn to perform xray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of dna that summer luria met john kendrew and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for watson in england in  watson visited the stazione zoologica anton dohrn in naples identifying the double helixedit dna model built by crick and watson in  on display in the science museum london in midmarch  using in part experimental data collected mainly by rosalind franklin and also by maurice wilkins watson and crick deduced the double helix structure of dna sir lawrence bragg the director of the cavendish laboratory where watson and crick worked made the original announcement of the discovery at a solvay conference on proteins in belgium on april   it went unreported by the press watson and crick submitted a paper entitled molecular structure of nucleic acids a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid to the scientific journal nature which was published on april   this has been described by some other biologists and nobel laureates as the most important scientific discovery of the th centurycitation needed bragg gave a talk at the guys hospital medical school in london on thursday may   which resulted in a may   article by ritchie calder in the london newspaper news chronicle entitled why you are you nearer secret of life sydney brenner jack dunitz dorothy hodgkin leslie orgel and beryl m oughton were some of the first people in april  to see the model of the structure of dna constructed by crick and watson at the time they were working at oxford universitys chemistry department all were impressed by the new dna model especially brenner who subsequently worked with crick at cambridge in the cavendish laboratory and the new laboratory of molecular biology according to the late beryl oughton later rimmer they all travelled together in two cars once dorothy hodgkin announced to them that they were off to cambridge to see the model of the structure of dna the cambridge university student newspaper varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on saturday may   watson subsequently presented a paper on the doublehelical structure of dna at the th cold spring harbor symposium on viruses in early june  six weeks after the publication of the watson and crick paper in nature many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery the  cold harbor symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the dna double helix watsons accomplishment is displayed on the monument at the american museum of natural history in new york city because the monument memorializes only american laureates francis crick and maurice wilkins who shared the  nobel prize in physiology or medicine are omitted watson crick and wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  for their research on the structure of nucleic acids rosalind franklin had died in  and was therefore ineligible for nomination the publication of the double helix structure of dna can be regarded as a turning point in science human understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began harvard universityedit in  watson accepted a position in the biology department at harvard university his work at harvard focused on rna and its role in the transfer of genetic information at harvard university watson achieved a series of academic promotions from assistant professor to associate professor to full professor of biology watson claimed however that he was refused a  raise in salary after winning the nobel prize he championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology stating that disciplines such as ecology developmental biology taxonomy physiology etc had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings going so far as to discourage their study by students watson continued to be a member of the harvard faculty until  even though he took over the directorship of cold spring harbor laboratory in  views on watsons scientific contributions while at harvard are somewhat mixed his most notable achievements in his two decades at harvard may be what he wrote about science rather than anything he discovered during that time watsons first textbook the molecular biology of the gene set a new standard for textbooks particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings his next textbook was molecular biology of the cell in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientistwriters his third textbook was recombinant dna which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function the textbooks are still in print publishing the double helixedit in  watson wrote the double helix listed by the board of the modern library as number seven in their list of  best nonfiction books the book details the sometimes painful story of not only the discovery of the structure of dna but also the personalities conflicts and controversy surrounding their work watsons original title was to have been honest jim in that the book recounts the discovery of the double helix from his point of view and included many of his private emotional impressions at the time some controversy surrounded the publication of the book watsons book was originally to be published by the harvard university press but francis crick and maurice wilkins objected among others watsons home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published cold spring harbor laboratoryedit external video james watson why society isnt ready for genomicbased medicine  chemical heritage foundation in  watson became the director of the cold spring harbor laboratory cshl between  and  the watsons two sons were born and by  the young family made cold spring harbor their permanent residence watson served as the laboratorys director and president for about  years and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus in his roles as director president and chancellor watson led cshl to articulate its presentday mission dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers neurological diseases and other causes of human suffering cshl substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under watson’s direction he is credited with transforming a small facility into one of the world’s great education and research institutions initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer in a retrospective summary of watsons accomplishments there bruce stillman the laboratorys president said jim watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science in october  watson was suspended following criticism of his views on genetic factors relating to intelligence and a week later on the th he retired at the age of  from cshl from what the lab called nearly  years of distinguished service in a statement watson attributed his retirement to his age and circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired human genome projectedit watson in  in  watson was appointed as the head of the human genome project at the national institutes of health a position he held until april   watson left the genome project after conflicts with the new nih director bernadine healy watson was opposed to healys attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences and any ownership of the laws of nature two years before stepping down from the genome project he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research he said the nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the worlds people as opposed to its nations he left within weeks of the  announcement that the nih would be applying for patents on brainspecific cdnas the issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the us by the us supreme court see association for molecular pathology v us patent and trademark office in  watson became president of cshl francis collins took over the role as director of the human genome project in  james watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online after it was presented to him on may   by  life sciences corporation in collaboration with scientists at the human genome sequencing center baylor college of medicine watson was quoted as saying i am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies role of oxidants in diseaseedit in  watson published a paper in the lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes dementia heart disease and cancer for example type  diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different a lack of biological oxidants not an excess and discusses this in detail one critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit and that the lancet published watsons paper only because of his name however other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression notable former studentsedit several of watsons former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including mario capecchi bob horvitz charles kurland peter d moore and joan steitz besides numerous phd students watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including ewan birney

chang yi wang he held the position for six years and retired from the board in  in january  watson accepted the invitation of leonor beleza president of the champalimaud foundation to become the head of the foundations scientific council an advisory organ watson has also been an institute adviser for the allen institute for brain science political activismedit during his tenure as a professor at harvard watson participated in several political protests vietnam war while a professor at harvard university watson along with  faculty members of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology including one other nobel prize winner spearheaded a resolution for the immediate withdrawal of us forces from vietnam nuclear proliferation and environmentalism in  on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima watson along with over  scientists and engineers spoke out against nuclear proliferation to president ford in part because of the lack of a proven method for the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste and because the writers of the declaration see the proliferation of nuclear plants as a major threat to american liberties and international safety because they say safeguard procedures are inadequate to prevent terrorist theft of commercial reactorproduced plutonium in  watson said i turned against the left wing because they dont like genetics because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes they want all failure in life to be due to the evil system controversiesedit use of kings college resultsedit an enduring controversy has been generated by watson and cricks unauthorized use of dna xray diffraction data collected by rosalind franklin and raymond gosling the controversy arose from the fact that some of franklins unpublished data were used without her consent by watson and crick in their construction of the double helix model of dna franklins experimental results provided estimates of the water content of dna crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugarphosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule franklin personally told crick and watson that the backbones had to be on the outside which was a crucial piece of information because before then linus pauling and watson and crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards her identification of the space group for dna crystals revealed to crick that the two dna strands were antiparallel the xray diffraction images collected by gosling and franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of dna franklins experimental work thus proved crucial in watson and cricks discovery watson and crick had three sources for franklins unpublished data  her  seminar attended by watson  discussions with wilkins who worked in the same laboratory with franklin  a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of medical research councilsupported laboratories watson crick wilkins and franklin all worked in mrc laboratories prior to publication of the double helix structure watson and crick had little interaction with franklin crick and watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with wilkins they offered him a coauthorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of dna wilkins turned down the offer a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at kings college in the eventual published paper rather than make any of the dna researchers at kings college coauthors on the watson and crick double helix article the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from kings college along with the helix paper according to one critic watsons portrayal of franklin in the double helix written after franklins death when libel laws did not apply anymore was negative and gave the appearance that she was wilkins assistant and was unable to interpret her own dna data the latter accusation was indefensible since eg franklin herself told crick and watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside which was crucial to the elucidation of the helix since before this both crick and watson and linus pauling had independently generated flawed models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards in his book the double helix watson described being intimidated by franklin and that they were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when franklin was doing dna research in the books epilogue written after franklins death watson acknowledges his early impressions of franklin were often wrong that she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science even though her work was superb and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate franklins generosity and integrity a review of the handwritten correspondence from franklin to watson located in the archives at cshl reveals that the two scientists later had exchanges of constructive scientific correspondence in fact franklin consulted with watson on her tobacco mosaic virus rna research franklins letters begin on friendly terms with dear jim and conclude with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as best wishes yours rosalind each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of dna in separate articles and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of nature these classic molecular biology papers are identified as watson jd and crick fhc a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid nature    wilkins mhf stokes ar  wilson hr molecular structure of deoxypentose nucleic acids nature    franklin r and gosling rg molecular configuration in sodium thymonucleate nature    the wording on the dna sculpture which was donated by watson outside clare colleges memorial court cambridge england is on the base these strands unravel during cell reproduction genes are encoded in the sequence of bases the double helix model was supported by the work of rosalind franklin and maurice wilkins on the helices the structure of dna was discovered in  by francis crick and james watson while watson lived here at clare the molecule of dna has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs adenine  thymine or guanine  cytosine controversial commentsedit james watson february  watson has often expressed provocative concepts and disparaging opinions of others within the realm of genetic research he has been quoted in the sunday telegraph  as stating if you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesnt want a homosexual child well let her the biologist richard dawkins wrote a letter to the independent claiming that watsons position was misrepresented by the sunday telegraph article and that watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion to emphasise that watson is in favor of allowing choice on the issue of obesity watson has also been quoted as saying  whenever you interview fat people you feel bad because you know youre not going to hire them while speaking at a conference in  watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive hypothesizing that darkskinned people have stronger libidos his lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects sex drive thats why you have latin lovers he said according to people who attended the lecture youve never heard of an english lover only an english patient watson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews arguing that stupidity is a disease and the really stupid bottom  of people should be cured he has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered saying in  people say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty i think it would be great watson has had quite a few disagreements with craig venter regarding his use of est fragments while venter worked at nih venter went on to found celera genomics and continued his feud with watson watson was even quoted as calling venter hitler avoid boring people uk book tour and resignationedit watson signing autographs after a speech at cold spring harbor laboratory on april   in his memoir avoid boring people lessons from a life in science watson describes his academic colleagues as dinosaurs deadbeats fossils hasbeens mediocre and vapid steve shapin in harvard magazine noted that watson had written an unlikely book of manners telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientists career he wrote watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university e o wilson once described watson as the most unpleasant human being i had ever met but in a later tv interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at harvard old history when they had competed for funding in their respective fields in the epilogue to the memoir avoid boring people watson alternately attacks and defends former harvard university president lawrence summers who stepped down in  due in part to his remarks about women and science watson also states in the epilogue anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated in early october  watson was about to embark on a uk book tour to promote the memoir he was interviewed by charlotte huntgrubbe at cshl in  she had been a student there in a program in which watson recruited students to live at his family home and work at cshl for a year huntgrubbe had gone on to work for the sunday times magazine she was selected for the interview as she was one of the few women to have been mentored by him huntgrubbe broached the subject of whether race was a factor in his hypothesis of divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populationscitation needed the following is a transcript of that part of the interview he says that he is inherently gloomy about the prospect of africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really and i know that this hot potato is going to be difficult to address his hope is that everyone is equal but he counters that people who have to deal with black employees find this not true he says that you should not discriminate on the basis of colour because there are many people of colour who are very talented but dont promote them when they havent succeeded at the lower level he writes that there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so though other publications noted that the paper had kept the profile sympathetic and placed the comments at the end of the piece the article was a public relations disaster for watson the sunday times magazine editor cathy galvin noted it was important the reader understood charlottes relationship with watson and her regard for him before exploring the explosive and unscientific territory of his opinions and history of statements about women race and abortion which have stirred so much controversy in the past watsons comments drew attention and criticism in the uk watson said his intention was to promote science not racism but some of the uk venues canceled his appearances watson canceled the rest of his tour because of the public controversy on october   the board of trustees at cold spring harbor laboratory suspended watsons administrative responsibilities on october  watson issued an apology on october  he resigned from his position as chancellor in  watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of cshl as of  he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory in a  bbc documentary watson said i have never thought of myself as a racist i dont see myself as a racist i am mortified by it it was the worst thing in my life some periodicals offered opinions on the matterclarification needed sale of nobel prize medaledit in  he decided to auction off his nobel prize medal in view of his diminished income after the  incident and to use part of the funds raised by the sale to support scientific research the medal sold at auction at christies in december  for us million watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in long island and to funding research at trinity college dublin watson is the first living recipient of the honor to auction the medal the medal was subsequently returned to watson by the purchaser russian tycoon alisher usmanov who stated that watson deserved the medal and that it was unacceptable that he should be compelled to sell it personal lifeedit watson is an atheist in  he was one of  nobel laureates who signed the humanist manifesto marriage and familyedit watson married elizabeth lewis in

join cbsnewscom connect facebook twitter email burden of proof the trial prosecutor sheila ross plays hardball  may  correspondent david kohn comments facebook twitter stumble jim watson could spend the rest of his life in prison but he says hes not worried we dont want a hung jury we dont want a mistrial we want an acquittal says jim i am innocent and id like for everyone else to know that im innocentbut before the trial begins judge t jackson bedford makes a decision crucial to the prosecutions case hearsay testimony would be admitted a major victory for ross who opens her case with a parade of beverlys friends and coworkers describing what they saw as evidence of watsons abuse and threatssome of the most damning testimony comes from beverlys best friend debbie white she said they had argued all night long and that she wasnt speaking to jim remembers white and as we were talking jim walked into the room and he pulled a shotgun and put it to the back of her head and he said so are you going to talk to me nowshe said this isnt the first hes done this to me ive woken up several times in the middle of the night and hes standing over me with a gun and he said see i could have killed you and youd never know what hit you white testifies beverly told me that one evening she was doing the dishes in the kitchen and that jim had come up behind her and grabbed her around the neck and before she knew it he had flipped her over and had slammed her head on the kitchen floor and was on top of her choking her she said that she was screaming and ashley had come into the kitchen and she was screaming for ashley to get him off of her that he was hurting herthroughout the prosecutions case jim sits stoically in court meanwhile daughter ashley tries to be strong for her father she sends her brother todd to camp to avoid the trial and since she cant attend because she has to testify ashley stays home and manages jims locksmith businessas the trial continues ross methodically builds her case using gruesome exhibits like a tattered pair of black panties found near beverlys bones my only hope is that jims life is filled with the same fear the same pain says beverlys brother scott bennet we want him to hurt far more than he made beverly hurt the case seems to be going rosss way until the medical examiner testifies that she cant determine the cause of beverlys death sexton jumps on the examiners admission suggesting that beverlys death may have been caused by something else besides murder he scores another devastating admission when a prosecution witness testifies that tests done on the dust found on beverlys car could not be tied to the spot where her body was found  or even to the state of georgiai hope to god the jury finds him not guilty says sexton this is one of those rare occasions where were representing an innocent personas the state rests the question persists has ross proven that jim watson is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt hes not going to break down and admit it says ross but the devil with him is in the detail and hes lying and hes a bad liarthe pressure is now on ashley watson to convince the jury that her father did not kill her mother ashley was only  when her mother beverly vanished but sexton asks her if she ever saw her father choke hit or hurt beverly in any way she answers no to every question ross wants to downplay the importance of ashleys testimony so she leaves the ashley questioning to cocounsel michelle mccutcheonmccutcheon have you ever seen your mother throw anything at your father ashleyashley no maammccutcheon have you ever seen your mother scratch your fatherashley no maammccutcheon so on january the th of  ashley if your father told you that your mother threw keys at him and scratched him that would be out of character for your mother wouldnt it ashleyashley it would be but i believed himhe has coached that kid every day about she should say and what she shouldnt say and i think it would be painfully obvious to anyone that this girls just going to parrot her father says ross when jim watson takes the stand he denies ever threatening his wife or making statements that he could kill beverly and hide her body where it would never be found its been very tough trying to raise two kids on my own says jim crying beverly and i were high school sweethearts she was my best friend during questioning ross asks jim if he cried when he first reported beverly missing or when he discovered that his wife was dead no maam i did not cry at the time says jim ross does her best to provoke jim asking him in depth about the makeup he had put on after his wife disappearedross tell me about your experience with makeup mr watsonjim watson i dont have much experience with itross makeup is used to cover up things up rightjim watson thats correctross and you used makeup to cover up scratches on your face rightjim watson they were covered up yesross and what kind of makeup did you usejim watson i dont knowross liquid or powderjim watson i dont recallross well you put it on rightjim watson i did ross show us how you put it onjim watson i dont recall how i put it onross weve got some makeup here you could show us how you put it onsexton your honor im going to object to that thats just totally unnecessary thats improperjudge ill allow itross weve got several types i dont know which type you used powder thats a cover up concealer and base which one was itjim watson i do not recall the type she used at the time ross well this would be the type that you usedjim watson right ross so youre not willing to show the members of the jury how you did itjim watson i do not recall how i put the makeup onross well did you look in the mirror to do itjim watson im assuming i did yesross because you wanted to make sure the scratches were covered up rightjim watson that was my whole intentionross exactly in closing each side appeals to the jurys sense of justice i would not be foolish enough to stand up here before you people and tell you that you should not suspect that jim watson might have done it that is the natural place you go when the wife disappears says sexton in defense of jim watson as you look to the husband you should suspect he did it but you are not allowed in this great country that we live in to make that quantum leap from suspicion to conviction unless the state can show some real evidence help beverly says ross give beverly what she deserves which is justice tell her killer that you will not reward him for being a good killer that you see through all his lies and you speak for beverly by letting her killer know that youre not going to let him get away with it if you do not hold him responsible for her murder no one ever willafter two weeks of testimony the question of whether jim watson killed his wife beverly is now in the hands of the jury but they dont have to wait for long the jury makes its decision after five hours of deliberationswe the jury find the defendant james lamar watson jr guilty of malice murderi felt like the weight of the world had just lifted off my shoulders says ross the judge immediately sentences
