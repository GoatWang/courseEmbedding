have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap including the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec the preparation of the separate account financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the separate account to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the audited financial statements and accompanying notes investment valuation investments in portfolio shares are valued at fair value based on the net asset value nav as reported by the underlying mutual fund on the last trading day of the year the separate account determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize its use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value this fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into the three levels based on the nature of the inputs quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority  level   followed by significant observable inputs other than quoted market prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities  level   and significant unobservable inputs including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use having the lowest priority  level
