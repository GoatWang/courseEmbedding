please go ahead frank sorrentino iii thank you joe good morning and thanks for participating in todays conference call to review connectone bancorps results for the second quarter ended june   we certainly appreciate your interest and are delighted to have the opportunity to share with you our solid operating and financial performance yeartodate regarding our format today bill will provide detailed color on our financial results in a few minutes i will begin todays discussion with a strategic review of the companys performance as well as update you on our operating results and tell you a bit more about how we are positioned for the rest of the year we will also leave some time for qa at the end of the conference call so we are exceedingly pleased with our second quarter operating performance highlighting our continued ability to capitalized on opportunities in serving our growing client base and consistent execution against key operating objectives those include maintaining strong organic loan and deposit growth delivering accelerated and sustained earnings growth improving return on equity and building and refining our infrastructure but today before we start speaking about our operating results lets just talk a little bit about our taxi portfolio as you saw in todays press release we recorded a  million pretax expense as a result of further weakness in the valuation of new york city taxi medallions thereby reducing the carrying value of our portfolio which is predominantly corporate medallions in new york city to  million this reflects a per medallion valuation of approximately  the valuation of the medallions on connectones balance sheet has been and will continue to be reflective of market conditions we have been very disciplined in this respect bill will speak a little bit more about this in a few minutes due to the charge we reported diluted earnings per share of  for the second quarter versus  in the sequential quarter and  in the prior period our entire tax medallion portfolio was classified as heldforsale with this quarters writedown our tax medallion exposure is now down to a level where regardless of any final resolution we expect no negative impact on our strategic plans and we also expect the volatility to subside in the future let me also add our new york city taxi medallion portfolio continues to cash flow quite well right now above  on our exposure of  million so we dont feel any pressure to pursue a higher sale so with that out of the way lets talk about our operating performance this quarter which has been exceptional excluding taxis we earned  in the second quarter  higher sequentially during the second quarter total demand deposits including interest and nonbearing and noninterest bearing increased by  on an annualized basis a principal focus of this company is further developing our ability to accelerate deposit growth so that its commensurate with connectones traditionally strong loan growth we believe connectone is positioned to achieve additional deposit growth driven by increasing our commercial loan portfolio enhancing cash management service capabilities expansion of our municipal and private school relationships and the utilization of our modern branch model which allows our staff to focus on sales our strategy of high quality customer service competitive rate structures and selective marketing enables us to gain market share extend our competitive position and achieve strong progress in our core deposit growth we have recently bolstered our team with cash management specialists whose deep experience will drive additional opportunities for deposit gathering at connectone additionally earlier this year we launched our online deposit account opening program which will allow us to augment our deposit gathering capabilities for both new and existing clients we continue to build momentum in loan originations and loan growth our loan receivable of  billion at june  reflected record loan growth of  million and we achieved overall loan growth yeartodate of  million or  on an annualized basis our total loan growth reflected strong performance across several lending sectors and continues the ongoing potential of our strategic focus consistent with our emphasis on diversifying our loan mix connectones loan growth for the quarter included an increase in commercial and industrial loans of  million representing an annualized growth rate of more than  for this noncommercial real estate segment while we dont expect  growth in ci every quarter we do expect this segment to help us diversify away from our reliance on commercial real estate in the future in terms of our cre lending multifamily increased by  million ph as we were very opportunistic in this space booking lower lpv purchase money mortgages at better spreads meanwhile our construction book decreased as loans permed out some of which we financed and some which were paid off and our other cre growth was essentially all owner occupied we are also seeking to increase our residential loans held in portfolio and we continue to make some progress in this regard while our second quarter loan growth was above historical levels the expectation over the coming quarters is for growth in the low to midteens which will contribute to a lower loantodeposit ratio moving forward our loan pipeline remains strong heading into the second half of  and we anticipate continued diversification of our portfolio as well as a continued focus on market opportunities in the spaces we are comfortable with additionally to drive our performance and support future growth we continue to invest in our people our infrastructure and our technology at connectone we have a strong track record of offering our client the latest technology to meet their evolving needs consistent with this we are proud to announce a few new partnerships within the fintech space first with zelle which is a consortium of the top  banks in the country to provide realtime payments right from your mobile banking app connectones forward thinking has landed us a first mover position in this space as zelle is well positioned to disrupt the persontoperson market currently monopolized by venmo second is with ncino which provides connectone with one of the most efficient and streamlined deposit and loan operating systems in the industry one thats built on the salesforce crm platform this partnership will continue to support our best in class efficiency metrics and at the same time enhance our excellent reputation for sense of urgency with our clients equally important to improving our efficiency metrics are a number of other near term initiatives including the ongoing redesign of our branches to connectones modern office model which will enhance our clients experience while building a sales focused model we are also deploying an update of our mobile app to provide our business in consumer clients with the usability that they demand in closing it was a solid quarter we got a strong first half of  and we are well positioned to deliver on our near term priorities while continuing to provide increasing value to our clients and our shareholders we have experienced strong deposits and loan growth and our earnings power remains strong our strategies for growth business and profit are very deliberate and we are very confident in our fundamentals our new york city initiatives are yielding results in both attracting new bankers and clients that are no longer served by any community focused bank connectone continues to fill a void for personalized services vacated by the largest institutions and by banks leaving our market due to consolidation in fact it is still the largest segment of our client acquisition story we are moving ahead with solid capital foundation and we remain well ontrack to achieve our objectives to further strengthen our balance sheet grow our profits and book value per share for the full year at this time id ask bill burns our chief financial officer to review the highlights of our second quarter financial performance bill bill burns thank you frank let me start off with some comments about the taxi valuation we were one of the first banks two years ago to recognize there was weakness in the sector we were among the first to place the assets in nonperforming and to take a charge so as frank just mentioned we have been very transparent in reporting charges or valuation allowances that are consistent with available market data which admittedly at times has been challenging as you know we have the medallion portfolio classified as heldforsale we believe this is a correct classification because this is our preference ph but doesnt mean we are required to liquidate the assets especially at a poor valuation that would hurt long term shareholder value the cash flow on our adjusted portfolio value of about  million yields in excess of  so i think its clear that we dont need to sell our decision rests on price versus our view on risk adjusted value details regarding our valuation methodology are forthcoming in our second quarter q now to operating results from an operating perspective we had a veryvery strong quarter by all measures loan and demand deposit growth were strong our net interest margin widened credit quality remained excellent our efficiency ratio improved significantly from the first quarter and operating earnings were above what was expected by the market at june  total assets have grown organically to  billion thats an increase of  million in just the first half of  loans led the way growing by  million from the prior quarter thats more than  on an annualized basis for the half its up  and our expectations are that we will grow at about  for the entire year could be a little more could be a little less so echoing and highlighting franks comments regarding ci growth it was particularly strong about  million for the quarter and our ci origination loan yields are in the  to  range loan spreads are in excess of  basis points in this category by comparison multifamily portfolio origination yields averaged  during the quarter with spreads of  basis points or more i think thats pretty good and higher than it has been recently our securities portfolio grew as well the average balance of our securities portfolio grew by more than  during the quarter ending up at more than  million at june  so we are targeting a level that is about  of interest bearing assets right now we are at about  we view this as a prudent level given our capital position our liquidity while still providing room for loan growth the tax adjusted yields on the portfolio fell during the quarter from  to  and i will explain why last year we reclassified our entire portfolio as available for sale and i see now more banks are doing this this transfer in turn facilitated our strategic shifts from corporates and indiscernible municipals to government secured shorter duration mortgagebacked securities most of this rotation complete and at this point i expect yields to remain about constant going forward as the portfolio grows net interest income was very strong for the quarter increasing by more than  from the linked quarter due both to margin expansion as well as an increase in loans and securities average interest earning assets increased by about  on a linked basis led by growth in loans and securities while we managed our cash balances to a lower level the margin expansion of  basis points versus a sequential quarter was due to a higher yielding loan portfolio and better asset mix offset by slightly higher cost of funding as well as the lower yields of securities i just mentioned deposit costs are coming under increasing competitive pressure but we have been modeling these increases all along and overall we do believe we can maintain the current net interest margin in the  to  range the flat yield curve does make it difficult to widen the margin from this level but our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we would benefit from higher rates obviously a driver of net interest margin is noninterest bearing demand deposits this quarters average demand is up  from last years second quarter and continues to remain a focus of both our commercial and consumer divisions now turning to the provision for loan losses the  million we reported during this quarter was primarily allocated to support loan growth at a rate of about  basis points during the quarter there was no releasing of reserves and no chargeoffs reflecting continued sound asset quality next our operating expenses excluding taxi charges expenses were essentially flat from last quarter increases in compensation expenses due primarily to a higher staff count they were offset by lower occupancy and a continued focus on expense management our operating efficiency ratio improved to  from  in the first quarter which is indicative of our extremely efficient infrastructure one that relies less on brick and mortar and focuses more on leveraging technology we were quite a bit better in the second quarter versus the first that was expected as typically we have seasonal factors working against us at the beginning of the year but having said that we continue to grow the core balance sheet and core revenue at a faster pace than infrastructure costs costs which include any investments in technology our expectation is that we can continue to drive efficiencies and finally the tax line we are targeting a tax rate of approximately  on our operating earnings the taxi charges do temporarily reduce the effect of tax rate but on a core basis we are targeting  and with that i will turn it back over to frank frank sorrentino iii great bill thanks before turning the conference call over for your questions id like to just take a moment to discuss some of our strategic priorities and outlook for the remainder of  i am proud of our management teams performance and we continue to believe the overall environment and the market fundamentals provide connectone with an excellent opportunity to enhance earnings and build book value we are continuing to increase momentum across our platform which gives us considerable confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond connectone will continue to focus on creating a desirable franchise as well as maximizing shareholder value we have certainly demonstrated this through our ability to attract and retain talent in the deposit and loan origination areas our continued investment in the necessary technology infrastructure to create additional operating leverage and our expansion into new markets at a measured pace within the consolidating bank environment value creation for connectone can also be achieved through ma by engaging with potential partners that would augment our existing plans or by partnering with a desirable franchise seeking one of the best markets in the country with that said this concludes our prepared comments we are now going to turn the call over to the operator and open it up to any questions that you may have questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question today comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead collyn gilbert thanks good morning guys frank sorrentino iii hi collyn collyn gilbert if we could talk a little bit about the loan growth and kind of outlook obviously it was very strong this quarter what do you kind of see driving that and especially its a good yield on the ci side maybe just talk a little bit more about kind of whats happening on the ci side frank sorrentino iii thank you collyn as you know momentum has been building here at connectone we started and we had said in the past over the last number of years we have been building some infrastructure around the ability to generate ci type loans we have hired a number of individuals over the last couple of years that is starting to gain some momentum and we really saw quite a bit of that in this quarter and our expectation going forward is we see a decent size if not larger contribution coming from the ci space we also i mean just in general over the loan portfolio we have had momentum in a lot of different areas whether it be our expertise in multifamily lending or in other forms of cre and construction although in this quarter as you noted our construction portfolio remains somewhat flat we are sort of happy about that thats our disciplined approach to how we approach the construction segment collyn gilbert okay okay thats helpful and then just on the funding side bill maybe talk a little bit about i know you said deposit pricing pressure you are modeling that in maybe just talk a little bit about your broader funding strategy and what specifically you are seeing in terms of deposit pricing pressure in the market bill burns well from a commercial relationship perspective we are always trying to drive noninterest bearing demand and so a lot of this depends on the success we have there we have had success over the past year and i look forward to more of that in the future in terms of the pricing pressure on the interest bearing transaction accounts the competition keeps raising rates and so we need to raise rates just to protect the balances we have and possibly grow but again its just a small portion of our total funding costs and its not really impacting the margin in a very significant way collyn gilbert okay and how about on the borrowing side what you are doing there is that an opportunity to look  go ahead bill burns you mean federal home loan bank borrowings collyn gilbert yes yes bill burns yeah well we continue to you know  we continue to fund part of the balance sheet there our preference is to do it through deposits but the tremendous amount of liquidity there there is  billion of availability at the federal home loan bank so  and i think we use it when we need to but there is not a particular strategy to increase our federal home loan bank borrowings collyn gilbert okay and then on the  just to confirm did you say bill  targeted loan growth for the year bill burns yeah i think thats a good  if you want to pick one number but we cant control these things it could be a little bit higher it could be a little bit lower you could see the second quarter was much higher than the first quarter and those kind of swings in loan growth per quarter is normal collyn gilbert okay and then tying it just to the nim guidance there obviously you came in better than i think what you guys were expecting for the quarter kind of maybe talk about sort of the variables as you are looking at your nim for the rest of the year bill burns you know there are so many variables right depends ph on noninterest bearing demand is a big driver and then the mix in the portfolio because we had more ci the spreads are a little bit wider that helped the margin so it really depends but when i average it all out i am really looking at kind of a flat margin and that includes the negative effect of the purchase accounting so if you take that out i am really projecting a slightly widening margin i think i said in my prepared remarks between  and  was a place i was comfortable with collyn gilbert oh you did yeah right yeah okay good and were there no prepays this quarter bill burns yeah there always is a sum and probably added a couple of basis points to the margin for the quarter and as you are analyzing this we had lower cash balances so if you take those two items it was kind of a flat slightly up quarter in terms of margin but not compressing collyn gilbert got it okay and then just finally on the taxi portfolio any update there in terms of interested parties in the portfolio or timing on a sale or maybe thoughts there frank sorrentino iii all i would say collyn in that regard is certainly as we sit here today there is definitely more interest thats coming to market relative to the taxi medallion portfolio from whether its private equity other owners other people interested in the space that probably didnt exist even six months ago and so while i cant sit here today and tell you there is any sort of sale contemplated the level of interest is muchmuch higher today in this space i am assuming thats because of where the valuations are today relative to the cash thats coming in or the cash flow thats coming in from those medallions collyn gilbert okay thats helpful i will leave it there thanks guys frank sorrentino iii thank you collyn operator our next question comes from william wallace with raymond james please go ahead william wallace thanks good morning guys bill burns hey wally william wallace i wasnt going to lead with taxi but since you just were talking about it maybe can you just talk a little bit about underlying trends that you are seeing from the cash flows from the fleet fleecing to the drivers changes out of tlc that are contemplated and then maybe if you could tie those thoughts into  i need to be careful about giving a number but how you would think where a  you mentioned that you are not going to sell at a fire sell value so how do you think of where you draw the line of value that you would be willing to accept to move these off the balance sheet versus a value that you think is too economically detrimental to shareholders frank sorrentino iii wally i think you sort of hit the nail on the head and let me take the last part first the portfolio today is  i think its over  or  paying and those payments are generating an over  return on our portfolio as it stands today so we have to put that up against whatever potential sale offer would be made to us and thats what we will look at in order to make a decision at this time we have not had or had the opportunity to sit down and get to a finalized number so i cant tell you what that would be as far as the industry in general there are a lot of changes that have occurred and continue to occur at the tnc which are two sides of the same coin on one hand we are seeing loosening of regulation for taxi a lot of different regard that we believe are beneficial for the industry on the other side there is increasing momentum about further regulation and changes in regulation relative to all the tncs at some point those things are going to meet the middle and we will get some equilibrium in the space but as we sit here today that is not true the number of nontaxi or transportation network vehicles continue to rise in the city and notwithstanding the fact that those drivers are not really making any money that has driven some pressure back towards taxi for more drivers that want to go back to taxi we still believe today and we have seen evidence that the revenue thats going into a single taxi cab has not really diminished all that much but its the driver who is in control of the fair share of that revenue when its not making its way back to either the operator or the medallion owner and until that whole scenario plays itself out its our belief there will continue to be pressure on the medallion space i do believe we are getting closer to the bottom i think as you saw many banks recently have either taken some charges ore revalued their portfolio taking a lot of this information into account we have been one of the first to come out and do that but i do believe over time that we will get to some equilibrium in the market and i believe we are a lot closer to that today than we were lets say a year ago william wallace and do you have  can you put some numbers behind what the cash flows of the fleets are able to collect on a medallion when they are leasing it out to drivers and maybe what that has done this quarter versus the last quarter or last year frank sorrentino iii yeah there is still a lot of variables that go into that today it depends on the size of your fleet your driver operation whether you have an individual medallion a corporate medallion there is no simple answer to that its a complex answer to what seems to be a simple question william wallace well yours are all corporate mostly all corporates right frank sorrentino iii right that is true william wallace and at the end of the day thats going to be the primary driver of value for anybody who is looking to buy these assets itâs the cash flow thats actually being collected from the drivers to the operators  i mean to the owner right frank sorrentino iii right and i think it has been pretty stable for cash flows in the industry but you know these are medallions we are valuing and the medallion valuation is more based on the cash flows for the medallions which is the least amount so it is two different things i appreciate your question about the industry and i think it has been stable in terms of the cash flows per cab william wallace okay thank you in the prior press releases you gave the gross loan fundings amount i didnt see it in the release i apologize if i missed it but can you  what was that number this quarter frank sorrentino iii well in the gross  most gross offence it was  million in the quarter and that includes loans that matured and we refinanced here william wallace so last quarter it was  million that you put in the release is that it is  frank sorrentino iii it was  million this quarter william wallace okay wow on the two fintech partnerships that you highlighted in your prepared remarks frank i assume there is some investment associated with these i am wondering if those have the potential to pressure the efficiency ratio nearer term or does your continued expense management offset any costs that get layered on because of these partnerships frank sorrentino iii well we have always said our infrastructure costs are all pretty much baked in we dont expect any blip in or spike in our expenses due to these  whether they are partnerships or moving into new spaces its all modeled into what our expense structure is william wallace okay all right great and then just one kind of housekeeping question bill you mentioned the tax rate your  kind of core expectation assuming no additional taxi valuation adjustment so those adjustments are those nondeductible bill burns no its not that its that you could apply our margin of  to  for any special charges william wallace okay okay thanks thats all i had thanks guys frank sorrentino iii thanks wally bill burns thank you wally operator operator instructions we will hear next from matthew breese with piper jaffray matthew breese good morning everybody frank sorrentino iii hey matt matthew breese just wanted to talk about the mix of the loan portfolio a little bit frank you seem a bit more bullish on residential forsale housing you also talked about growth in the commercial segment so just think about those two items and looking out a year or two years how do you see the mix of the loan portfolio evolving frank sorrentino iii so we definitely see increased capability at connectone to generate and book more ci exposure we are very bullish on the forsale market specifically in our market area so we expect to see more in the way of both forsale construction and first mortgages for residential properties and more specifically in the jumbo area for those i think the combination of those things will take some pressure away from our cre concentration i dont think its going to change it dramatically but i think you are going to see a directional shift and a change over time matthew breese indiscernible think about residential loan growth last quarters have been quite strong certainly stronger than what we saw last year is this  to  a quarter kind of rate is that something we should look for going forward here frank sorrentino iii yes and hopefully a little bit higher thats what we are aiming for bill burns matt that business also ties into our quasiprivate banking model where the client that we are servicing had the business and owns a high valued home and we want to do that mortgage as well as to be part of a complete relationship matthew breese understood okay and then could you just provide us with the commercial real estate concentration this quarter and if we are talking about a directional change lower just give us some idea of the extent that might change bill burns well it was about the same as the prior quarter there is almost no change in the concentration and our aim is to lower that ratio matthew breese okay and then on the fintech partnerships admittedly i dont know much about either of these i just wanted to get a sense for where is the need coming from are the customers demanding it and if there is a pl impact from a revenue perspective i would just love to hear that or is it more of a growth engine for relationships and deposits is that more of the goal bill burns so in the first case with the zelle product for those of you know what venmo is this is a venmo competitor and it was designed by some of the top banks in the country and there is a consortium of banks of which we are one of that are participating in this product this is a product that we believe from everyone from the millennial generation on forward to just about everybody that is moving from a checkbased system to cashless and mobile payments platform this is going to be the product of choice its instant realtime payments over a network and it really doesnt matter what bank youre with if youre within the consortium so whether you are with one of the top  banks of the country or you connect one you would have immediate ability to transfer funds amongst any number of people so i believe close to  or  of the population is covered just with those  banks so to me thats a product that people may not know they want today but they are going to want it and we are going to be there we have a first move position in this product space so thats just being a little bit forward thinking and making sure that connect one is relative to whether you are a business client a consumer client doesnt matter we want to make sure we have the right tools and the right products for any client anytime anywhere on the other hand ncino is more an internal product although our clients will see a change in the utilization of that product but that product is going to allow us to really streamline  further streamline all of our operations inside from credit underwriting through credit administration every point of contact with our client every point of contact within the bank for every person that works here revolving around the clients and being able to do that in an automated way having small business loans have automated decisioning giving regulators auditors even clients themselves and their experts access into the system to be able to provide information in a realtime basis and further reduce our costs over time so from a revenue generation perspective we believe that like we believe in a lot of things with connectone if we can convince our clients that we act with a sense of urgency and we are going to be the ones to get there first and we can do it in an efficient manner and we can close it with a guaranteed certainty of execution we are going to win those transactions we are going to win those relationships and we are going to win those market initiatives and ncino is the partner thats going to help us to make it even better or to further our ambitions to be one of the most efficient banks in the country matthew breese very good look forward to hearing more about that interesting thats all i had thank you guys bill burns thank you matt frank sorrentino iii thank you matt operator it appears there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to mr sorrentino for additional remarks
