process providing that the policy was purchased more than six months before a bankruptcy process was initiated investors in swiss annuities benefit from tax exemption according to swiss law although a  withholding tax is imposed on any interest received in a swiss bank account by a foreigner this does not apply to annuities finally swiss insurance companies are not obligated to report the purchase

or annual maintenance fee this fee is used for the maintenance of both the property and the common grounds within the complex the principal benefit of purchasing a vacation ownership is the security of a fixed price as opposed to a rental fee which is likely to increase over the years it is estimated that vacation owners save up to  percent in accommodation costs and that the investment in a vacation ownership pays for itself after five years often the yearly allotment of time purchased can be transferred to other parties with relative ease about swiss alliance group experts in vacation

thought of acquiring a second home comes with conditions as unique as the person who has it the two most basic reasons are investment and a place to vacation and revitalize when considering investing in a private residence club prc perhaps the most important factor is that it offers a real vacation assuming that the purpose in buying a second home is to alter one’s regular routine and indulge in

your caribbean vacation information compiled by swiss alliance group the island nations of the caribbean region offer travelers inviting climates beautiful stretches of beach and numerous opportunities for shopping dining relaxing and visiting sites of historical and cultural significance to get the most out of your experience plan the timing of your trip well in advance keeping these factors in mind december through april represents the region’s busiest tourist season resulting in more crowds and generally higher prices if you elect to travel offseason you can experience accommodation costs as much as  percent less than those of the high season the downside you may encounter lessthanoptimal weather or find your resort undergoing offseason maintenance vacationers may want to consider a trip in may when temperatures average in the s and s the threat of hurricanes remains low and many festivals sporting contests and other events take place while some attractions may be closed many others offer lastminute and offseason discounts while most islands experience hurricane season june through november the last month entails relatively little risk among the drawbacks to visiting in november are the possibility of missing out on a traditional american thanksgiving and the generally smaller number of festivals and cultural events swiss alliance group based in zurich
