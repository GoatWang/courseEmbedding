 million in fines penalties and judgments daniel indiviglio in a reaction piece appearing in the atlantic argues that the bloomberg article is biased and misleading asserting that the bloomberg team only found eight instances of alleged misconduct by a giant multinational over the span of  years in  for the  reported oil spills allegedly attributed to koch and its subsidiaries that had taken place across six states koch paid what was at the time the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law for the illegal discharge of crude oil and petroleum products it was the first time the government had ever aggregated several spills over a number of years under one combined lawsuit against a company koch disputed the epa figures saying the epa did not file claims in over half of the  alleged cases and further that many of these alleged spills are not even listed in the epas own oil spill data base in a settlement with the us justice department and the state of texas which included leaks that occurred as the result of third party actions like digging the company agreed to pay a  million civil penalty improve its leakprevention programs and

achieving legislation on taxes energy and nuclear power defense appropriations and financial regulatory reform koch industries has been criticized by the environmentalist group greenpeace for the role they allege the company plays in affecting climate change policy in the united states koch industries replied to the greenpeace report saying it mischaracterizes their political efforts and distorts the environmental record of our companies who have put tremendous energy into achieving sound environmental stewardship and have consistently implemented innovative and costeffective ways to reduce waste and emissions including greenhouse gases the response further explained that in line with their guiding principles koch companies and koch foundations have worked to advance economic freedom and

the wall street journal by charles koch titled why koch industries is speaking out the article states because of our activism weve been vilified by various groups despite this criticism were determined to keep contributing and standing up for those politicians like wisconsin gov scott walker who are taking these challenges deficit spending by governments seriously the company also funds the political action committee kochpac in a  opinion piece in the wall street journal charles koch wrote about his beliefs on a free society saying a truly free society is based on a vision of respect for people and what they value in a truly free society any business that disrespects its customers will fail and deserves to do so the same should be true of any government that disrespects its citizens the central belief and fatal conceit of the current administration is that you are incapable of running your own life but those in power are capable of running it for you this is the essence of big government and collectivism in february  charles koch wrote an opinion piece for the washington post titled this is the one issue where bernie sanders is right in which he argued that democrats
