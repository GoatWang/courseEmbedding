monthly distributions estimated current return  estimated long term return  estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates you should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference july   the securities and exchange commission has not approved or disapproved of the trust units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus any contrary representation is a criminal offense invesco investment objective the trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of intermediateterm corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds including build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o all ratings provided for the bonds must be at least bbb if issued by either standard  poors or fitch ratings and at least baa if issued by moodys investors service inc or in the case of a bond with no issued ratings such a bond has credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the trust in the opinion of the sponsor o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk build america bonds were issued pursuant to provisions in the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment from the united states treasury treasury equal to  of the interest payable on such bonds on or about each interest payment date  for those build america bonds that qualify and are designated as recovery zone economic development bonds build america bonds must have been issued before january   to finance governmental purposes for which taxexempt governmental bonds excluding private activity bonds could be issued however the excess of available project proceeds over amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund may be used to finance only capital expenditures qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers may elect to receive direct interestsubsidy payments from the us treasury if certain conditions are met qualified school construction bonds are issued to finance the construction rehabilitation or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bondfinanced facility will be constructed qualified energy conservation bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes and clean renewable energy bonds may be issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity although the year of issuance is not restricted for qualified bonds federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types generally any qualified bond sale proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer three years after the issue date of such bonds will be redeemed within  days of the expiration of the threeyear period federal legislation imposes requirements on build america bonds and qualified bonds that issuers must continue to meet in order to receive ongoing federal subsidy payments the portfolio generally consists of corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced even to below investment grade bbb or baa and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future in particular should the issuer of a build america bond or qualified bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the recovery act it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the financial markets including those for corporate bonds have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuers assets or the extent of its obligations for these or other reasons the ratings of the bonds in the trusts portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond in particular qualified bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o we do not actively manage the trusts portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will

otherwise terminated as provided herein the trust agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an intermediate term trust each unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of the trust the number of units is determined based upon a  principal amount of bonds in the trust per unit to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will increase although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objective and bond selection the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a the ratings criteria applicable to your trust as listed under principal investment strategy b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in an investment grade income trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poors rating services downgraded the longterm sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trusts holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trusts investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trusts portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes interest rates in the united states are at or near historic lows which may increase the trusts exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bondsqualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereto bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent thereby adversely affecting the trusts net asset value no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity as a result of such illiquidity the trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your trust are listed under portfolio these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest all other municipal bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary build america bonds were issued pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the recovery act authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the united states treasury department treasury and the internal revenue service irs in an amount equal to  percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors  percent for those build america bonds that qualify and are designated as recovery zone economic development bonds the recovery act adds a new section to the internal revenue code of  as amended the code which authorizes build america bonds that meet the definition of qualified bonds as described below to receive the refundable credit the code section defines the term qualified bond to mean a build america bond a issued before january   b with  percent of the excess of i the available project proceeds as defined to mean sale proceeds of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon over ii the amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue are to be used for capital expenditures and c where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the code apply should a build america bonds issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the code it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments in addition build america bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to sections aa or  of the code as added by the recovery act or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a build america bond issuers borrowing costs qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds collectively qualified bonds are taxable bonds that are similar to certain build america bonds in that state and municipal qualified bond issuers may elect to receive direct interestsubsidy payments from the us treasury if certain conditions are met the hiring incentives to restore employment act enacted into federal law on march   permits issuers of qualified bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest payments qualified school construction bonds issued pursuant to provisions in the recovery act are issued to finance the construction rehabilitation or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bondfinanced facility will be constructed qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds are both issued pursuant to the energy improvement and extension act of  and like qualified school construction bonds are governed by section a of the code qualified energy conservation bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes and clean renewable energy bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity although the year of issuance is not restricted for qualified bonds federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types federal legislation has amended the code in recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of qualified bonds and to include such bonds under the definition of qualified tax credit bond as found in section a of the code eligible issuers of qualified school construction bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury eligible issuers of qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to  of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal taxcredit bonds set daily by the us treasury should the issuer of a qualified bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the code or other federal laws it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds as provided in section a of the code qualified bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance this mandatory redemption must be completed within  days after such threeyear period unless an extension is granted by the treasury additionally qualified bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any qualified bond issuers borrowing costs certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue

factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds

income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the

pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these
