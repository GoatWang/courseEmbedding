at wang chambers as vice–president was forced to lay off some  employees an experience he found profoundly disturbing so disturbing in fact that he abruptly left wang even though he had not yet landed another job of the massive layoff at wang he later said ill do anything to avoid that againin  chambers joined cisco as senior vice–president of worldwide operations the company at that point had annual sales of about  million in the fall of  ciscos board announced chambers appointment as president and chief executive officer effective in january  by  cisco had increased its annual revenue to more than  billion a phenomenal increase due in no small part to the leadership of chambersalmost from the start chambers began selling the internet and networking with missionary zeal in a november  interview with zd comdex chambers predicted that companies that dont adopt networking and the internet will be left behind regardless of their size the productivity gains are too large every major aspect of how business will be done will be affected by this new technology and cisco has certainly been practicing what chambers preached the company transacts more than  percent of its business over the internet more than that chambers has made cisco a shining example of the productivity gains that can be achieved through use of the internet both by speeding up most processes and sharply reducing costs every corporate function—including customer support finance manufacturing and human resources—at cisco is performed through net systems winning a reduction of  billion in costs between  and  chambers himself is obsessed with customer satisfaction every night before he retires he routinely listens to ten or so voice–mail messages from staffers in the field who have phoned in reports on the status of ciscos top accountsasked by zd comdex about the challenges likely to face companies seeking to implement a network–centric approach to doing business chambers conceded that companies will have to make some significant adjustments the first is there are five to maybe ten applications that are the big payback applications you want to select the right applications at the right time for your industry    the second is to really think about how your network is going to work and what the true cost of the network is    and the third thing is to determine what they are going to do themselves and what theyre going to look for their partners to help them do in the implementation of the networkto speed ciscos growth and diversify its product base chambers has engineered the acquisition of more than  companies since becoming the ceo a key area he has targeted for growth is the telecommunications sector envisioning a time in the not–too–distant future when data voice and video will be delivered over a single connection in our homes in chambers vision ciscos vast data networks could in time become the worlds leading voice networks ciscos maneuvers in the telecommunications arena will not go unchallenged as the longtime telecommunications leaders become increasingly internet–savvy they are moving to head off ciscos move into the sector in mid– nortel bought bay networks inc a longtime rival of cisco chambers has traveled the country to promote the new world that has been opened up by the internet for business and consumers alike he spends nearly half his time on the road spreading his message in his keynote address at comnet  in washington dc chambers used several examples to press his case for connecting companies globally and to prove how pervasive both networking and the internet have become he pointed out that at a growing number of colleges the traditional college library has been replaced by the world wide web and term papers are submitted via e–mail he also pointed to the rapidly growing number of company meetings conducted through videoconferencingchronology john t chambers born graduated with babs in business from west virginia university graduated with jd from west virginia university began business career at ibm moved to wang computers joined cisco systems inc as svp worldwide sales and operations named ciscos president and ceo assumed position as president and ceo  cisco transacted one–third of worlds electronic commerce given internet industry leader award by us internet councilin selling the internet around the world chambers often cites a university of texas study commissioned by cisco that predicts that by  electronic commerce will account for roughly a quarter of the worlds gross national product companies that fail to take advantage of the internets business potential he warns very likely will face irrelevancyin august of  chambers announced major changes in ciscos organizational structure changes designed to help the company better serve its customers at the heart of the changes was a move from ciscos line of business structure to centralized engineering and marketing organizations in announcing the restructuring chambers said our line of business structure has served us very well in the past when customer segments and product requirements were very distinct today the differences have blurred between these customer segments and cisco is in a unique position to provide the industrys broadest family of products united under a consistent architecture designed to help our customers improve productivity and profitabilitychambers speaks with a slight southern twang but nobody is likely to mistake him for a country bumpkin he was once described as a west virginia choirboy who will eat you for lunch the cisco ceo expresses unshakable confidence in the future of his company predicting that theres no reason cisco cant be the most successful company in history perhaps the highest market cap but also the most generous with its employees with payback for its shareholders and also the best giver to the community one indicator of ciscos generosity to its employees came when forbes magazine named it the third–best company to work for abc news  magazine show dubbed chambers the best boss in americain addition to being a big booster for the internet chambers has been a major cheerleader for the development of san jose the california city that serves as ciscos headquarters he has proposed massive office complexes on the northern and southern edges of the city expansions that would allow cisco to triple its workforce in the san jose area perhaps the biggest project planned by cisco has been the construction of a  billion corporate park in san joses coyote valley the complex would house up to  cisco employees chambers isnt above using strong–arm tactics to get what he wants for cisco after he announced his plan for the coyote valley office complex in  he made it clear that he could take ciscos business elsewhere if the necessary approvals werent handled expediently it takes one phone call to north carolina he said its a much easier place to do business although chambers threat ruffled the feathers of some of san joses city fathers a lot of us were cheering said san jose chamber of commerce president steve tedesco finally somebody could tell the city like it issocial and economic impactchambers has not only guided cisco to phenomenal success but hes been a passionate advocate for electronic commerce and the internet hes traveled the world to convince government and business leaders how important it is that they embrace the new net economy were living through the second industrial revolution he tells all who will listen and for those who may be tempted to ignore his warning and let the internet bandwagon pass them by he warns you can be amazoned in a momentchambers has molded cisco into one of the biggest and most successful companies of all time while at the same time ensuring that the companys employees look upon their employer as concerned and sensitive about their needs in this arena hes been amazingly successful having won the plaudits of abc news  as americas best boss and having cisco consistently rated among the best places to work in countless surveys its not hard to understand when you hear chambers talk about his personal credo as ciscos ceo never ask your employees to do something you wouldnt be willing to do yourselfchambers hasnt neglected his civic duties either he has a long and admirable record of philanthropy ranging from sponsorship of the worlds first internet–based charity concert to forking over  million for a san jose area community center among the causes about which chambers cares the most is education a couple of years back he contributed a quarter of a million dollars of his own money to help get a measure making it easier to build and repair schools on the

chairman of cisco has become a silicon valley statesman whether he’s promoting the expansion of digital networks or calling for limits on government surveillance by jason pontin june   cisco systems designs makes and sells the routers switches and other networking equipment with which businesses connect their computers manage data centers and access the internet since its founding in  as a maker of multiprotocol routers it has survived every market change through aggressive acquisition sometimes of competing technologies john chambers who led much of cisco’s growth retired as ceo in  after  years but continues to serve as executive chairman jason pontin mit technology review’s editor in chief spoke to chambers in india where he was conferring with narendra modi about the prime minister’s campaign to bring internet access and services to the country’s vast population what are the challenges in giving online access to nearly everyone in the world the number one objective is that people who make the investment in digitization whether they are governments or service providers get a reasonable return some programs have not moved as aggressively as i would like like in the united states others are very aggressive like india’s the numbers in andhra pradesh are just amazing they think they can bring  to  megabytes to the home for  per month that’s a magical number in terms of local family income because anything below  percent per capita income is when you really get broad penetration if it’s successful india will be a model for other countries to follow this story is part of our julyaugust  issue see the rest of the issue subscribe how important is the industrial internet—the internet of things—to cisco’s future extremely important it’s connectivity that really makes the industrial internet work it’s giving the right information at the right time to the right person or right machine to make the right decision that decision can be on the manufacturing shop floor it can be in a supply chain it can be in the retail store to your customer it can be in how you service that product remotely either in a home or a mining site aren’t you a little concerned about the security of these devices organized crime and rogue nation states and terrorists are very much focused on the internet of things the challenge that goes with connectivity is always security the bad guys go wherever the return is and now it’s more lucrative for bad guys to focus on cybercrime than traditional crime japan had  billion cyberattacks and issues last year up  percent over the prior year edward snowden showed that the nsa intercepted cisco equipment and installed backdoors you complained that the nsa had undermined trust in us tech companies do you see evidence that any standards of conduct on government surveillance will be approved it’s taking longer than all of us including government leaders would like but i think the discussion between the president of china and the president of the us was constructive they are making reasonable progress on corporate espionage by coming together with what we call rules of the road governments will always spy on each other that’s been going on from the very beginning of time for that you want rules for acceptable legal intercept which has to be done by court order but in terms of corporate espionage we need conduct that people can count on was apple right to refuse the fbi’s demand to unlock the san bernardino gunman’s iphone once you put in backdoors once you allow a government to intercept anything they want you have to give it to other governments around the world once you do that there is no privacy there is no security there is no protection for democracy so be very careful what you wish for you might get it and that’s why i think tim cook was courageous to say “there’s got to be a better way” because doing carte blanche was not going to be acceptable you’re still an active chairman but when you look back on your tenure as ceo what was your biggest success the people and the culture we built at cisco at cisco we are able reinvent ourselves every three to five years we can do innovation at a speed that our peers over time have not kept up with and that’s why we have no competitors from  years ago we encourage a healthy paranoia how much risk is acceptable in managing market transitions the penalty for missing them is much more than the risk of going after them aggressively between trump and clinton who has the better technology policies if you’re asking “how do you give middleclass america a pay raise how do you create opportunities how do you make the country more competitive on a global basis in a way that allows everybody to benefit how do you change health care and education”—well those
