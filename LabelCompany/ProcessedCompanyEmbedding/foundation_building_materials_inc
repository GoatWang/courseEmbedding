my original partners john gorey and tom fischbeck and me we will stay focused on servicing our customers working as a team and partnering with our vendors i also want to mention our logo and the

nongaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures in addition to results under gaap this press release contains certain nongaap financial measures including ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance these measures are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap we calculate ebitda as net income loss before interest expense income tax benefit expense depreciation and amortization we calculate adjusted ebitda as ebitda before certain nonrecurring adjustments such as purchase accounting adjustments ipo expenses stockbased compensation noncash gains losses on the sale of property and equipment derivative financial instruments and management fees paid to private equity sponsors ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because they are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses financial performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry these measures when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our company and its results of operations ebitda and adjusted ebitda have certain limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to net income or as any other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with gaap these measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for which these nongaap measures make adjustments additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be liquidity measures other companies including other companies in our industry may not use such measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure the

contains certain nongaap financial measures including ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance these measures are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap we calculate ebitda as net income loss before interest expense income tax benefit expense depreciation and amortization we calculate adjusted ebitda as ebitda before certain nonrecurring adjustments such as purchase accounting adjustments ipo expenses stockbased compensation noncash gains losses on the sale of property and equipment derivative financial instruments and management fees paid to private equity sponsors ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented because they are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses financial performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry these measures when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our company and its results of operations ebitda and adjusted ebitda have certain limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to net income or as any other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with gaap these measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for which these nongaap measures make adjustments additionally ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be liquidity measures other companies including other companies in our industry may not use such measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure the following is a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to the nearest gaap measure net income     three months ended
