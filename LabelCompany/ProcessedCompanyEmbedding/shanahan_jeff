cardconnects ceo jeff jeff shanahan thank you joe and thank you to everyone for joining us today ill open with a brief recap on the first quarters financial and operating metric results and then ill highlight some of our key initiatives and recent developments bankcard volume grew to  billion in the first quarter a  increase over the prior year quarter exceeding the highend of our  guidance we provided last quarter all of the growth in the quarter was organic it was the fastest rate of quarterly period  quarterly periodoverperiod organic growth in the companys history the increase in bankcard volume was primarily driven by the growth in our integrated channel integrated processing volume for the first quarter increased  over the prior year quarter to  billion this contributed to revenue growth of  and net revenue growth of  adjusted ebitda for the quarter was flat as compared to the prior year quarter as we invested heavily in the technology and sales strategic growth initiatives we discussed on our last earnings call general and administrative expenses for the quarter was on plan and in accordance with our  guidance in the first quarter total integrated processing volume was  of our total bankcard volume up from  of total bankcard volume in the prior year period volume growth also continues to benefit from an increasing proportion of our enterprise service customers selecting cardconnect for their acquiring services now id like to update you on some key initiatives lets start with our recent acquisition of mertzco inc this company was led by michael mertz who has become chief  who has become cardconnects chief sales officer following the acquisition prior to this transaction mertzco was cardconnects largest and fastest growing valueadded reseller over the last year michael mertz has also successfully transitioned his team of  sales personnel to focus on the growing isv space in addition to the mertzco acquisition we are pleased to announce a significant expansion to our presence in denver colorado to support the growth in the isv market weve already added eight new sales employees in denver to support our sales efforts targeting software partners who need a unified payments platform with bestinclass security between mertzco and our organic investments in sales personnel in denver weve assembled a talented sales team to focus exclusively on the unique opportunity we have in the integrated payments market in the first quarter we won several large isv deals such as vermont systems inc and part space representing over  potential new merchants that can now take advantage of our integrated card point platform these key wins are primarily driven by our new bolt product which connects secure pointtopoint encrypted devices to software platforms via cloudbased api our enterprise channel also continues to generate outstanding growth with over  new signings in the first quarter of which eight have also chosen cardconnect as an emerging acquirer the growth in the first quarter was heavily impacted by our recently announced strategic partnership with billtrust the leader in payment cycle management through the strategic partnership billtrust integrated quantum its endtoend payment cycle management solution with cardsecure cardconnects comprehensive enterprise payment processing platform the integrated solution supports businesses by simplifying the way they process collect and applied credit and debit card payments the solution also provides customers with a secure payment acceptance gateway advanced merchant acquiring services and pci validated pointtopoint encryption and tokenization for complete data breach protection in addition to enterprise and isv we are also ramping up our newly formed financial institutions group we believe our unique technology offerings our key differentiator to penetrate new and existing community and regional banks lastly we remain focused on our loyal reseller network our reseller channel continues to see strong doubledigit growth driven by bestinclass distribution tools and merchantfacing technology in closing we believe the record organic volume growth in the first quarter substantiates our strategy focused on using innovative and bestinclass technology to differentiate cardconnect as a leading provider of valueadded solutions in the payment industry our plan for the rest of  is to continue organically investing in sales and technology to accelerate topline growth we will also be opportunistic with addons that complement our technology and sales efforts we are confident in meeting our original guidance for  which will also be updated by chuck bernicker our cfo to include the impact of the mertzco acquisition so with that let me turn it over chuck to review our financial results chuck chuck bernicker thank you jeff and to everyone for joining the call my presentation will include nongaap financial metrics which we believe are important financial performance measures for our business and more closely reflect how we manage our business in addition i will provide an overview of our april acquisition of mertzco as well as an update to our  financial guidance as a result of this acquisition as jeff discussed we had a very strong first quarter fueled by organic bankcard volume growth of  which outpaced our  financial outlook this resulted in net revenue increase of  to  million as compared to the prior year period net revenue growth lagged volume growth more than we expected as we continue to see a shift to larger merchants and strong growth in enterprise acquiring volume this was offset by strong volume growth of  that drove net revenue growth to outpace our  financial outlook also included in net revenue is our saas revenue from enterprise services for the quarter although a small piece of our business we recorded  million of saas revenue or a  increase as compared to the prior year period moving down our pl other cost of services increased  to  million as compared to the prior year period other cost of services is primarily comprised of commission expense paid to our distribution partners thirdparty processing costs and merchant losses the  increase in these costs outpaced net revenue growth of  due to higher than expected payments to our largest distribution partners we believe our recent acquisition of mertzco and investment in sales will help mitigate this pressure moving to our general and administrative expenses for the quarter our ga expenses increased  to  million this increase was primarily due to increased stockbased compensation expense of  and the previously discussed initiatives in product development direct sales and marketing many of these initiatives begun in the late fourth quarter of  and were mostly reflected in our first quarter as a result our ga expenses outpaced our net revenue growth but remain within our  financial outlook for the quarter moving down to adjusted ebitda for the quarter adjusted ebitda was  million flat as compared to the prior year period when ebitda was  million for the quarter the adjusted ebitda margin was  a decrease from the prior year when adjusted ebitda margin was  of net revenue this reduction in margin is a result of the items we previously discussed for the quarter depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to  million as compared to the prior year period while net interest expense increased  million from  in the prioryear period this increase reflects our new capital structure as a result of our july  merger moving down  moving over to our balance sheet and cash flows i want to call out a few items in the quarter we renegotiated and extended our process agreement with first data under the terms of this amendment the company made a cash payment of  million and certain contract terms were modified which included reductions in pricing schedules associated with transaction processing and an extension of the term through  also we made a scheduled principal payment on our firstly lean credit facility ending the quarter with  million of debt also we ended the quarter with  million of unrestricted cash on hand and  million available in our revolving credit facility i would like to make a few comments on the mertzco acquisition subsequent to quarter end on april   we closed the transaction with our largest distribution partner mertzco total consideration for the transaction was  million in connection with the transaction cardconnect entered into portfolio purchase agreements with mertzco subagents for total consideration of  million on april   we borrowed  million under our first lien credit facility to fund the cash consideration for these transactions now id like to take a minute and provide updated  financial guidance we are reaffirming our initial  guidance and providing an update that reflects the transaction with mertzco completed on april   bankcard volume is expected to be  billion to  billion revenue is expected to be  million to  million net revenue is expected to be  million to  million while adjusted ebitda which includes  million of general and administrative expenses related to growth initiatives is expected to be  million to  million the additional ga expenses will support previously discussed initiatives and product development direct sales and marketing with that i will now pass over to jeff for his closing remarks jeff shanahan again we are pleased with the first quarter results and performance more importantly we are confident that by taking the long view and making strategic investments in our sales organization and technology platform that we can sustain if not accelerate our growth longerterm with the acquisition mertzco weve made significant progress in further penetrating the fastgrowing isv market and in expanding our sales organization both as well as other partnerships with leaders like billtrust continue to strengthen our competitive position finally let me again thank all of our cardconnect employees for their significant contribution to another great quarter operator were ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from george mihalos with cowen your line is now open allison jordan good morning this is allison jordan for george congrats on the results and thank you for taking my question just a followup on your closing remarks about the mertzco acquisition i am curious if you can give us a little more detail about what that brings to the table for cardconnect and then i know chuck you talked about the updated guidance for  but could you perhaps provide a little more detail about how to think through the changes to the model longer term from the acquisition jeff shanahan sure this is jeff ill start with your first part of your question so mertzco has been a partner of cardconnect for close to  years now he has been  his group has been our largest and fastest growing reseller of cardconnects products and services so this is a very strategic acquisition from us from a couple perspectives one it brings us a new chief sales officer to lead our sales efforts internally which is super important and michael has demonstrated a unique ability to be a very successful salesperson within the merchant acquiring space for almost  years now so that was probably the most important secondly it transitions a lot of our reseller distribution into internal distribution which going forward will improve margins significantly so i think you those are main reasons why we wanted to do the deal also because the mertzco sales team was primarily focused on isv and that also is one of the main focuses of our company it was a very strategic fit for us to do that together under one umbrella chuck do you want to answer the second chuck bernicker sure and allison in terms of the model so primarily the mertzco acquisition is actually a catalyst for topline growth as having an extreme focus on our integrated channels so clearly thats number one and number two is its a shift from  we no longer have to pay the thirdparty commission expense and our other cost of services which was something we addressed in our remarks as well and then lastly is previously mertzco had approximate  of the volume of cardconnect so we do pick up incremental revenue from processing that wasnt with cardconnect and thats also reflected in our updated guidance allison jordan great thank you thats very helpful and very encouraging to hear and then just as my followup jeff in your prepared remarks you spoke about an increasing amount of your enterprise clients choosing cardconnect as their processor i am just curious if you can provide a little more detail there may be about the growth youre seeing in the enterprise channel and if you can maybe a little more detail on how successful you have been in crossselling the merchant processing maybe per center or maybe tell you to provide their thank you jeff shanahan yes so this has been a trend that started basically in  so last year close to a third of our new enterprise clients choose our acquiring in the first quarter it was starting out at closer to  so it seems to be an increasing trend and our overall view on that is basically the enterprise services that we offer are easily complemented with merchant acquiring services providing a single source solution to the enterprise in need of payment processing services so its kind of a one for the choke model and we see it as a continuing trend going forward that were going to be capitalizing on allison jordan great thank you for taking my questions operator and our next question comes from jason deleeuw with piper jaffray your line is now open jason deleeuw thanks guys good morning and just want to ask a question on the guidance for the fullyear guidance was maintained ex the mertz acquisition in the first quarter the revenue was a little bit stronger adjusted ebitda a little bit lighter but still maintained that ebitda outlook for the full year so just should we  was the first quarter was just kind of a heavier investment spending quarter and can we expect the margin profiles to improve from here then jeff shanahan yes thats exactly right jason this is jeff we frontloaded a lot of that investment into the first quarter so we expect obviously revenue and net revenue to continue to increase in gentlemen and administrative expenses to flatten out the year which will increase that margin so like we said on the prepared remarks we feel like were on plan with our  financial outlook without mertzco and then obviously we try to be updated with that as well jason deleeuw great thanks and then last quarter on the call there was talk about the growth accelerating the revenue growth accelerating in the back half of the year and into  given the investments that youre making right now are we still on track for that jeff shanahan yes we feel really good about that first quarter was our best quarter ever in terms of new signings on the isv side obviously it was a really strong quarter in enterprise side as well our reseller network continues to grow in doubledigit lease so yes we feel really good about that the pipeline is extremely good right now of either recently signed about to be signed partners on the software side and now its really a matter of us executing the conversion of their existing merchants and their new merchants coming in so thats why weve focused on frontloading the expansion of our sales efforts to make sure that we can actually execute on that and which will  if we do execute on it that will drive increased topline growth towards the end of the year jason deleeuw great and then the last question i just want to make sure i heard this right i think with the new isv partner wins i believe you said there was  new merchants that you could be going after now and im just trying to get a sense because i think you have a little more and  right now on the smb side so i am just trying to get a sense of their  how many of them of those merchants are currently using a payment processor right now so i am trying to get a sense for how much of that would have to be competitive take away by cardconnect versus how much of that is greenfield for cardconnect jeff shanahan yes virtually all of them are using some sort of payment processor so these are businesses that are obviously using the business management software system but also capturing payments as well the difference  the pool of  plus is basically broken out into  some are already integrated into the previous provider that the software system integrated to and then some are using standalone nonintegrated processing systems but overall its been a take away in all cases its just in one case its a take away from an integrated provider and then in the other case its a takeaway from a nonintegrated provider jason deleeuw sounds good thank you very much operator and our next question comes from bob napoli with william blair your line is now open bob napoli thank you good morning lets see i guess the first question on just the mertzco acquisition the volume what percentage or how much of your volume came from mertzco chuck bernicker about    of our volumes bob napoli okay and then i guess the balance sheet chuck and the shares  the weighted average shares outstanding we should expect as with the deal closing so how much debt did you end up putting on and what would be the  what is the share count should we expect for a fully diluted share count the rest of the year jeff shanahan so good questions bob so we borrow as i said we borrowed  million under our revolver to fund the cash side of the transaction and we issued  million not roughly two million shares of stock to mertzco as part of the transaction bob napoli okay so were looking good about  million shares is that right jeff shanahan right and thats disclosed in our  in our press release as well bob napoli okay and then just trying to get the math of some of the pieces of the business with the growth rate of  with ipods being  of your volume and growing  and enterprise still tiny but growing  which pieces of the business are growing slower obviously those piece growing are key to accelerating your total growth profile which pieces of the business  you said reseller was growing now some of that resellers ipods i guess from mertzco but which pieces of the business are not growing or not going this fast that as the high growth pieces become bigger well see that acceleration in growth jeff shanahan yeah i think that  you hit on a couple things so yes part of our reseller group in our bank channel and also sell the integrated solution so we dont really look at it from a distribution channel perspective in terms of the growth numbers the nonintegrated side of the business is growing ish so thats where if you take the  of the nonintegrated part which is  of the business thats ultimately equal to  plus overall growth bob napoli okay and then as the enterprise business so there was a company that im sure you know paymetric that was sold to vantiv at a pretty good price and i think youre one of a handful of competitors to that now your businesses is much much smaller but first of all is it fair to compare your enterprise business to paymetric and then what is the opportunity youre still very small growing fast how fast can that business grow and become meaningful assuming im correct in comparisons jeff shanahan yes so we have a very similar solution to answer your first question to paymetric product suite without go after the same sort of businesses that are running sap and oracle or other erp systems we feel really good about the overall opportunity in that space we continue to see around  growth in that channel weve made investments in the fourth quarter and some of the first quarter to continue to expand our sales presence in that area so we feel like weve got a great opportunity to maintain that growth or accelerate that growth going forward bob napoli okay the partnership with billtrust just like to understand that a little bit better and what billtrust brings to you and from a technology and partnership perspective and it sounds like its already had helped you win some new business jeff shanahan yes sure so billtrust obviously from a customer base bills with enterprise clients some of their enterprise client run sap and oracle which were able to partner with actually when those sort of deals and then some of their enterprise that are not running sap and oracle are still using billtrusts quantum solution which weve integrated into our cardsecure enterprise product so were bringing business two ways basically from the software and security perspective both through their quantum enterprise system and their customers that are running sap and oracle and then we also have the opportunity just like we do with the rest of our enterprise clients that are also bringing acquiring services through that as well so we feel really good about this partnership its brought us a lot of business quickly and were very focused on it bob napoli are there any thoughts on your smb business on offering additional products what additional products are you working on one of the players who seems to have done  seems to have gained a lot of traction with invoices and instant payment essentially paying the merchant one day sooner for a  fee things like that are you working on are there any products and invoices or instant deposits things like that that youre looking to add to your customers jeff shanahan so instant deposit wouldnt really be applicable to our average customer profile on the smb side our average merchant on the smb side process over  annually so something like instant deposits more applicable to i think the micro merchant space so thats  we offer nextday funding as a default so they can get their funds the next day so its really not economically sound for them to ask for that funding a day earlier and pay  which is obviously pretty high annual apr if you did the math and then we do have a long laundry list of items on our product roadmap on the smb side most of them are just features and functions that were adding to the cardpointe platform so electronic bill present is on the roadmap thats one thing but theres a very long list of other things that were adding into the cardpointe platform but most of them are more or less features that just complement the overall offering bob napoli thank you appreciate it jeff shanahan thank you operator and our next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald your line is now open joseph foresi hi could you provide some color around spreads and the changes in the expectations of what they were this year versus  this quarter versus what youre expecting this year jeff shanahan sure ill let chuck take that chuck bernicker sure so weve modeled  longterm weve modeled that our topline would tick down about a four basis point each year in our model and what were seeing in this quarter is that a little more than that right now so as i said in my comments and thats just being offset by the incremental volume so part of it is just the impact of shift to larger merchants as merchants get larger theyre paying less joseph foresi okay and so that obviously will close a little bit as those larger merchants start to ramp right makeup the volume chuck bernicker exactly joseph foresi okay and how many sales people were hired in this quarter and how does that fit with your goal for the year and then how long do you expect those salespeople to take the ramp obviously mertz’s is probably already ramped jeff shanahan yes so organically we added over i think and total sales reps across all the channels majority of those were in the isv channel which we mentioned during the prepared remarks and as we mentioned mertzco itself as a organization brought us  total sales reps so weve added a significant amount close to  in the first quarter which is a dramatic change for us joseph foresi okay do you think that your  it sounds like its one quarter the first quarter weighted investments so do you feel like youre done with the sales force hires for this year and that youve achieved your goal and that now its a matter of them ramping or is there more to go jeff shanahan yes so from a headcount perspective its going to be largely flat for the rest of the year so we did do a majority at the beginning of the year per our plan right in and most of those  a lot of the salespeople aren’t just out there trying to sell new deals are also basically supporting the isvs from a sales support perspective and converting over the merchant basis through sales campaigns and lead generation and things like that so we have this tremendous pipeline right now that we built and either recently signed or to be signed isvs and were trying to make sure that we have sophisticated sales infrastructure to execute on converting that joseph foresi got it and the last one for me youve talked about some longerterm revenue growth maybe acceleration and then obviously next year you could get some margin uptick because this year was an investment year can you just update us on those longterm goals and how you feel about them in light of the investments in q thanks jeff shanahan yeah i think  i think the biggest factor is really the pipeline itself so obviously when youre making investment in sales like there you have to have a pipeline to back that up so we have their best pipeline ever right now in the isv market and also in the enterprise space so we feel  we still feel really good about our overall plan in terms of accelerating topline growth towards the end of this year and definitely into  and from an investment perspective from opex we feel like weve made a significant investment and we should be able to flatten that out and increase operating leverage into  so i think all the remarks we said on the previous earnings call are still all true and we believe that were on track joseph foresi okay thank you operator and our next question comes from mike grondahl with northland securities your line is now open mike grondahl hey guys congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions the first one is just kind of followup on the sales people that youre hiring including mertzco whats the total number of salespeople march to march just trying to understand that delta jeff shanahan march last march to march  to march now mike grondahl for may whatever is easiest for you guys but just trying to get a feel for the total number of salespeople added jeff shanahan so its around  i think last march total across all of our channels and then closer to  this march mike grondahl thats quite an increase thats great you guys mentioned signing  enterprise deals in q how does that compare to last years q jeff shanahan i dont have that information handy right now but i can tell you that  is the most that weve signed in one quarter mike grondahl okay and what sort of the goal for this year in terms of enterprise deals jeff shanahan i believe the goal is  the goal was originally around  enterprise deals so we feel like we had a pace first quarter was significantly strong so i am not sure if were going to be able to bring on  every quarter but we feel like were definitely on track to meet our goal in terms of new enterprise clients mike grondahl got it and just lastly the isv with vermont systems and part space how do you see those relationships in the approximate  smbs behind it ramping are you guys selling into that now will that start soon how do we think about that ramp jeff shanahan yes so basically for someone like vermont systems we already are selling into it so there is two parts to the selling process one is basically to try to figure out a campaign and marketing approach to convert existing clients and then the easier part is obviously on the new client side so when they bring in a new customer its basically doing better our payment processing services into that new customer signing so it just automatically comes over to us but these are  vermont systems area a perfect example of somebody that was looking for a perfect card not present to gateway and then most importantly a card present pointtopoint encrypted solution that was easily integrated to the software platform so it shows us specifically for those reasons and now their customers can take advantage of those added services mike grondahl great thanks hey thanks a lot guys jeff shanahan thanks mike operator operator instructions our next question comes from brad berning with craighallum your line is now open brad berning good morning guys a few followup questions on the isv conversions and lets talk about sales tractions on some various channels maybe you can touch base a little bit when you have a new isv partner come on board and you have say  potential merchants as a pool can you give us like a  and  months what is the type of range that you guys can convert over that period of time historically obviously youre adding sales staff to help professional that effort more so going forward but can you give us a baseline of how you think about that opportunity set and how that conversion works over time jeff shanahan yes sure we really dont have a lot of  we dont really have a month historical dataset to show you since were fairly in the early innings of the isv approach overall but i think if youre dealing with a pool of  merchants i think if you can convert over  of those merchants in a month period that would probably a good thing were trying to also focus on isvs that are not just  that dont just have an existing base of merchants but also have a strong new deal flow and obviously thats really the golden opportunity is to convert over  not convert over but to sign these new merchants on theyre bringing to modest customers but were fairly new at the conversion process overall so were working with these groups to help market our services towards them and develop campaigns but we feel like  over a twoyear period would probably be pretty good i think we could probably do better than that but i think thats probably conservative brad berning and then out of the new deal flow they bring to you as the preferred partner are you getting  of those or do you have  is it deal by deal and you have some range of the portion of the new deal flow that youre typically winning jeff shanahan its really casebycase so we have certain isv partners that were fully embedded into the sales process and their customer agreement that theyre automatically choosing cardconnect services because whether they default or theyre exclusive provider and then we have others that requires a little bit more of a sales effort to make sure that were bring them over so there is a broad range of it and obviously weve got many many software partners so it really spans brad berning and then given where youre at in those efforts how would you characterize your confidence level in the baseline assumption for this year versus  months obviously gives you a lot more time to work with how do you think about guidance for this year on the expectations for the conversion frame versus next year obviously youll have more time to work with that im just curious how you think about that from folded it into the guidance assumption the acceleration in the second half jeff shanahan yes so the guidance assumption really wasnt based on a lot of the first quarter signings we made in the isv space so a lot of this is upside to our guidance so its obviously a matter of how quickly we get to those these things take time obviously from an immigration perspective its not that much time but getting the sales efforts ramped up does take some time so theres definitely upside to our guidance on the total addressable isv merchant base i think the biggest thing to us the thing that we can control is hiring a bestinclass sales support team to go after these right now and the hires that weve made in denver complemented by the unbelievable team that mertzco brought to the table i think gives us really a unique team to focus on the isv space so were really focused on it from a people perspective trying to get the best people in the space to go after these things we continue to see the pipeline go up and up and up but its obviously its on us to now convert these over to make them successful brad berning and the financial institutions channel as a followup to that you talked about stepping up there can you talk about where did you add and obviously a pretty long sales cycle process for that channel can you talk about where youre at in building a pipeline for that how do you feel about your competitive offerings there when do you think that that channel could potentially contribute to growth jeff shanahan yes the bank is still pretty small so just everybody knows the bank channel came to us from an acquisition of vanco in late  we started towards the end of  ramping up from a personnel perspective so we hired somebody to actually run the bank channel and hired some really key people to help grow that so overall its a pretty small part of our business but we think that when you look across the bank channel specially the community and regional banks we think theyre underserved largely overall in the space there is still really more of the traditional sales model signing up on a paper application with the nonintegrated device and getting a paper statement at the end of the month so the opportunity we have is based to bring our really slick distribution enrollment tools to the bank channel as well as the merchant facing technology and overall the reception has been great so far just the bank channel has probably the longest sales cycle of any of our distribution channels so its definitely a longterm investment thats something that we feel is well worth it brad berning and then one other followup in regards to not necessarily exactly like mertzco but other retailers some nice relationships how do you think about the pipeline of opportunities there is that something that youre actively engaged in for this year yet or is that something to think about that youre going to digest what you have and youll think about other opportunities as they become more opportunistic along the way and just kind of curious how youre thinking about repeating that opportunity set jeff shanahan yes we feel i think this is a channel overall in the space its been shrinking or at least most of the folks i think from the investor side look at it as a flat or shrinking channel weve continued for obviously since weve been in business weve been focused on this reseller side like i said its still growing double digits we think weve got a great opportunity for it whether its a software partner or a reseller from a distribution perspective the pulls that weve created all work the same we feel like were really uniquely positioned into it weve made a couple hires in the side from some of our competitors to recruit new ones overall we feel very good about that and its a space that still makes up a large percentage of our overall revenue and its supporting to us and were going to continue to focus on it brad berning yeah i apologize and more of  have you thought about your appetite for more acquisitions in that channel to pull some of the existing relationships inhouse jeff shanahan yeah so we definitely feel like theres opportunity outside of mertzco obviously mertzco is the largest and fastest growing of all them so that was the most important and were obviously thrilled to get that done but yeah we will be moving on to other groups to see if there is a deal to be had so theres definitely opportunities outside of mertzco and its something that were focused on brad berning excellent ill get back in the queue thank you very much jeff shanahan thanks operator and the next question comes from jason deleeuw with piper jaffray your line is now open jason deleeuw thanks guys for the followup just wanted to get a little bit more color on bolt it sounds like its helping you win more business and onboard merchants easier is this ultimately going to be the primary way that cardconnect goes to market is it going to be with bolt and how you interact with isvs or is this something thats just going to be one option and its just going to be kind of a slower ramp but just trying to understand like the future of bolt and how youre planning to go to market with it jeff shanahan yes so when we look at the isv space we divide it up into two different areas one is card present api integrations which we feel like the market is pretty saturated in theres plenty of providers out there that provide that and then when you look at the mobile side you obviously have folks like stripe and square or stripe in a braintree so our focus on the isv space is clearly on isvs that need a device integration with pointtopoint encrypted technology and what bolt does is basically shorten and simplifies that integration process significantly so its definitely if you look at our firstquarter signings or even a majority of them have chosen us i think because of the bolt product so a majority of that  plus addressable merchant base in isv side is coming to us through the bolt integration so its definitely the leading edge of our isv efforts and we think its going to be the primary driver going forward were choosing to focus on the device integration side of the isv space because we think that theres less  its less crowded and we have unique obviously offering chuck bernicker and jason let me just add one thing to jeffs comment early on i think jeff meant to say that everyone else is focused on cardnotpresent where we have an opportunity on cardpresent jeff shanahan thats right chuck bernicker as a lot of our opportunities are focused on bolt addressing the card present opportunities jason deleeuw got it thanks and then the comments with the cost of services it grew faster in net revenue growth with the payments to the distribution partners but now with the acquisition that could lessen an impact but should we still expect the cost of services growth to outpace that of the net revenue growth jeff shanahan so i think the biggest thing is our biggest group specially a couple like mertzco was growing faster than we budgeted so from a commission perspective we paid out more than we expected which obviously increased the cost of other services more than we expected the first quarter so thats why that mertzco acquisition was so important not only for the strategic reasons of bringing a sales officer but it also  it corrects a lot of pressures that we had in the business side i think going forward ill let chuck answer the question on whether it outpaces net revenue growth chuck bernicker so obviously for us the shift to the integrated channel the partners distributing the integrated are paid less so obviously the opportunity for us is to see less pressure on the commission expense or the faster we can migrate the volume to more of a direct and integrated model and the less dependence we have on the indirect and the distribution partners thats the catalyst for dropping the cost of services so in the long term were actually its  in the longterm were actually positioned to see the catalyst reducing that expense its really a shortterm pressure where its just how quickly can you shift and pivot and very optimistic that well get that under control jason deleeuw sounds good thank you very much operator and our next question comes from bob napoli with william blair your line is now open bob napoli thank you just following on jasons question it was the direct versus indirect what percentage was the mix in  and then with the sales reps that you hired in the mertzco acquisition whats the run rate through the balance of  and what is your longerterm  medium to longer term goal in direct versus indirect jeff shanahan yes bob unfortunately we really dont look at it as direct and indirect specifically because technically on the directs maybe you would consider direct also involves a software partner which includes a revenue share too which is from a structural perspective the same as a reseller so i think its more of a question of how can we pivot from pure resellers into software partners that have a lower payout and obviously are utilizing a lot of more of our technology and i dont have that information handy in terms of exactly what those splits are but a majority of our business is always going to involve a partner or could be considered indirect because there is going to be a revenue share even on the bank side theres a revenue share paid out to the banks we look at that as sort of direct originated business from us but were still relying on a bank partner to provide us the leads and for us to close them and were paying them a revenue share of it so i think longterm were always going to be a very partnerfocused company just given our distribution model bob napoli is there another way to think about that mix broadly of i guess direct partner versus reseller through a reseller jeff shanahan yes i think maybe a better way of looking at it is basically how many of our deals come from a pure reseller versus a bank an employee an association an isv and enterprise sides i think in the first quarter it was still probably close to over half from a reseller so some of those resellers are utilizing our integrated technology and obviously were trying to shift that but were still very focused on the reseller sites so its not  were trying to obviously bring our products and tools into the distribution channels were not so much trying to slow down one and grow the other one faster we think that we can grow the isv the bank and the enterprise side the fastest and i think weve proven that recently but from an overall  we could bring on a massive reseller next quarter and it could completely change that kind of proportion again but that doesnt mean that were not still growing faster from a relative base on the more the technology facing side so its hard for me to answer that question i dont want to confuse you guys bob napoli sure okay thank you operator and our next question comes from brad berning with craighallum your line is now open brad berning yes as a followup can you quantify what your total merchants available in the isv channel pipeline are now back to about the  in new but i know you guys have had some pipelines before can you put some metrics on the overall opportunity in the pipeline of announced deals at this point jeff shanahan yes so between recently signed  between signed and to be signed deals that weve high probability on we feel like were closer to  total addressable merchants to the isv side and thats obviously grown significantly over the last two quarters so thats obviously a strong sign i think of us to accelerate topline growth longterm brad berning and your total merchants at the end of the first quarter that youre currently processing for jeff shanahan total open merchants at the end of the first quarter  brad berning and thats up about  for the quarter jeff shanahan no thats about  yearoveryear brad berning about  okay jeff shanahan we bring on new merchants theyre usually of larger size and the merchants that we lose are smaller size so merchant count isn’t really a great metric for us to track to simply because of the profile the merchants that were losing versus the profile of the merchants that were bringing on brad berning yeah understood and then on mertzco could you kind of given the sub iso relationships part of the deal economics can you could you quantify what the all in trailing ebit multiple was on that deal and how do you  i think you characterized that as probably at the higher end of how you look at deals going forward given just the unique nature of that particular deal but just to give investors i think at least an upper bound range of how to think about deals that you would look at over time jeff shanahan yes so from a pro forma perspective i think we look at it to roughly  times deal so when you combine the residual buyouts that we did along with the mertzco agreement when they were really all one transaction we just had to split them up for tax reasons because of the folks that working for them had to sell so the residual is that way so its roughly a  million total deal and its from a pro forma perspective around  million in adjusted ebitda brad berning and thats a  pro forma jeff shanahan thats yes  pro forma brad berning okay thank you very much operator and that does conclude todays qa session ladies

infocardcwcom log insign up smartceo cardconnect ceo jeff shanahan featured february   michelle by samantha drake photography by mitro hood during the height of the december  holiday shopping season target corp admitted a massive data breach had occurred exposing the personal information of  million customers who had used their credit and debit cards at the retail chain ultimately target found that the personal data of approximately  million customers had been compromised which led to a nosedive in sales scores of lawsuits against the retail giant and state and federal investigations a few months ago target’s ceo resigned the data breach didn’t surprise jeff shanahan at all “we knew that was coming” says shanahan  who took over as ceo of payment processor cardconnect in february  “we knew there were many many merchants out there that were taking peoples’ cards and not securing them from the minute they got them” wakeup call huge data breaches tend to catch shanahan’s attention because king of prussia pabased cardconnect is in the business of making sure its clients’ inperson and online credit and debit card payment transactions are secure target’s was hardly the first big data breach but it made cardconnect’s customers nervous enough to check in and make sure they were adequately protected notes shanahan “the target thing was a wakeup call for our industry as a whole” he says in  alone neiman marcus group ltd pf chang’s china bistro and michaels craft store chains have all announced significant data breaches that compromised the information of millions of credit and debit card holders cardconnect’s goal is to ensure its customers don’t become a statistic in this disturbing trend its proprietary payment gateway and security products address the needs of merchants who accept credit and debit cards as well as gift cards and loyalty cards with more than  retail customers nationwide ranging from the pizza place down the street to fortune  companies cardconnect processed  billion in card transactions in  not including debit cards the growing company brought in more than  million last year and has  employees up from just  in  and along the way shanahan has made key strategic decisions that enabled the company to scale quickly by buying smaller similar companies and then focusing on obtaining technology cardconnect didn’t already have at the same time shanahan drove cardconnect’s relocation from ohio led the company’s rebranding and positioned the company to meet the latest security challenges work and family in  a group of entrepreneurs including brian p shanahan jeff shanahan’s oldest brother formed the payment processing firm financial transaction services llc in cleveland oh the founders picked cleveland primarily because that’s where the company’s first president lived a few months later at brian shanahan’s urging jeff shanahan joined the new company as chief operating officer and relocated his family from pennsylvania to cleveland “i’d always thought about working with brian before but i didn’t think it would work too well being in the same office” shanahan admits adding with a laugh “we both have large personalities” fortunately brian shanahan who was ceo at the time and lives in pittsburgh left the daytoday operations to his brother “it actually worked out wonderfully” shanahan adds “it was time to pass the baton” says brian shanahan  a serial entrepreneur in the credit card processing space and now cardconnect’s nonexecutive chairman of the board he notes that he and his brother think similarly and see highprofile breaches like target’s as both vindication of cardconnect’s approach and an assessment opportunity it’s a tossup as to who calls the other first to talk about the latest data breach news brian shanahan adds the two aren’t the only family members involved in the company their youngest brother patrick joined cardconnect in  and is now chief operating officer in addition their father jim and another brother michael are among the company’s more than  independent sales agents that resell cardconnect’s services a fifth brother is a cardiologist in pittsburgh naturally at shanahan family gatherings the talk inevitably centers on work “fortunately or unfortunately it always turns to business” says brian shanahan on the move the company remained in cleveland for more than six years before relocating to the philadelphia area shanahan says moving the company’s headquarters has been his biggest decision so far “with all due respect to cleveland it was very hard to find new talent there” he says “i never felt like we could get to the next level there” shanahan presented the move to the  employees in the cleveland and chicago offices as an opportunity to grow with the company “we knew we had big things ahead” he explains he was pleasantly surprised when the cleveland employees jumped at the chance although the chicago workforce was a harder sell the company renamed cardconnect offered generous relocation packages to those who wanted to move and separation packages to those who didn’t says shanahan the relocation cost cardconnect about  million which was a big hit for the company in the short term but will pay off in the long run brian shanahan points out king of prussia’s suburban location outside of philadelphia was a logical affordable choice on the east coast for the new headquarters shanahan says cardconnect still has an office in cleveland as well as offices in boca raton fl kansas city ks and denver co shanahan and his wife tara and their son and three daughters ranging in age from one to nine years old now live in devon pa best buys cardconnect’s strategy since its inception has been to grow quickly by buying other companies between  and  cardconnect bought nine companies around the country the acquisitions — one in  two in  one in  one in  and four in  — brought scale to cardconnect and reversed its negative cash flow “we were a small merchant service provider to a few thousand merchants back in  our first few acquisitions were done more out of necessity we needed to get bigger quickly” explains shanahan “until you get to scale you’re kind of always behind” each new purchase brought a new salesforce and customers on board enabling cardconnect to increase the number of transactions conducted a key measurement in the industry he points out as cardconnect grew its strategy became more selective as it began focusing more on technology and buying similar small providers of merchant services shanahan says the purchase of princeton payment solutions pps in  represented this focus and because pps is located in the princeton nj area it also reinforced the decision to move the company headquarters to the east coast shanahan explains the deal boosted cardconnect’s customer list with customers including general electric co and adobe systems inc pps brought cardconnect a tokenization process it had developed and patented for its fortune  customers tokenization involves replacing sensitive payment data with a unique identiﬁer known as a token which renders cardholder data unreadable and therefore useless to hackers according to cardconnect combining tokenization with pointtopoint encryption ppe — where plaintext card data is converted into cipher text at the time of collection — offers the best protection against data theft building a brand “when i look back most of our great decisions were made fairly quickly and based on our instincts” notes shanahan “when you’re growing fast nobody sits down with a playbook and scripts what you’re going to do with the company” rebranding the business for example was a swift and intuitive process in april  financial transaction services changed its name to reflect the company’s shift from working primarily with independent distributors to developing and selling its own products and services shanahan says he also wanted the new name to be the company’s url brainstorming sessions and consultations with a local public relations firm focused on what the new name should convey about the company and its business “it boiled down to ‘we connect card transactions’” says shanahan so the company settled on the name cardconnect tested it out and then ran with it too much analysis and planning can undermine the decisionmaking process says shanahan pointing out that “the more you analyze things and the more you think about things the more complex they get oftentimes the answer is sitting right in front of you” he advises others to simply “go with your gut and don’t overcomplicate things” mistakes will be made along the way of course but your decisionmaking track record will improve over time he adds shanahan admits it was easier to make quick instinctive moves when the organization was small because at that point the decisions were made “out of survival” in the early days management knew the company had to get bigger fast so they researched the best acquisition opportunities and then went out and bought those companies cardconnect could afford to take risks because it had less to lose he notes shanahan is known for his ability to make quick confident decisions confirms patrick shanahan  who became chief operating officer in  after joining cardconnect to help manage a new acquisition buying another company is already a long process without spending months hashing out details he says noting that jeff shanahan knows what’s important and what’s not in closing a deal a rapidly growing business needs a leader who is “nimble and can change directions quickly” patrick shanahan says “not everyone is cut out for it” test evaluate and pivot as cardconnect grew jeff shanahan says he started taking a more analytic approach to decision making “you don’t do things as fast as you did early on because you’re trying to do the ‘perfect’ acquisition or the ‘perfect’ deal” he explains the company pivoted its business strategy in  with the purchase of pps until then cardconnect primarily resold other companies’ processing services and payment gateways which capture the credit card information and send it to the processor in order to keep up with competitors cardconnect began providing its own payment solutions through pps the new strategy gave cardconnect a foothold in payment gateways which continue to be a dynamic developing part of the payment processing industry of course not all decisions work out as planned shanahan acknowledges cardconnect overextended itself in  when it bought four companies as the company struggled to absorb its new assets while continuing daytoday operations it took a needed break from acquisitions in  “you have to pace yourself a bit i think at certain times we tried to grow too fast” says shanahan “as a result of doing too many acquisitions at once we ended up with some problems” there’s only so much time and so many people to manage the issues that come up he notes shanahan says the organization is now ready to jump back in and is scouting potential firms “we are looking to buy” he says a bright future as cardconnect continues to create new security solutions for its customers its biggest upcoming challenge is helping customers comply with certain security mandates by their  deadlines us merchants adhere to standards for protecting payment card data set by the payment card industry pci pci is mandating the replacement of credit and debit cards that have a magnetic stripe on the back with cards embedded with emv chips that encrypt the card’s information “emv” stands for europay mastercard and visa the card issuers that first championed chipbased payment cards europe and canada got on board with the initiative right away but the us held off and is now playing catchup with the rest of the world says shanahan merchants must now have emvcompliant terminals to accept payment cards with emv chips by october  or face a shift in liability from the card issuer to the merchant shanahan considers the move to be too little too late “the emv thing is great but implementing it after the fact doesn’t help much” he says furthermore “the cost of converting to emv is a lot higher than it would have been  years ago” in advance of the deadline cardconnect is partnering with payment solution provider ingenico to offer customers emvcompliant payment acceptance devices integrated with cardconnect’s encryption technology says shanahan while cardconnect had no control over the timing of the migration to emv cards the company hopes to capitalize on the mandate by enticing customers to use pointtopoint encryption as well a second  deadline also looms pci is rolling out its latest data security standard dss known as pci dss  which governs the controls on sensitive data stored on credit debit and other types of cards to reduce data breaches and fraud among other things pci dss  will require merchants to be more vigilant about monitoring for security breaches pci dss  is being phased in over time but will officially take effect on july   once again the stricter pci dss  standard is a reaction to breaches that have already happened shanahan points out still cardconnect has its work cut out helping get customers on board with the new costly requirements particularly smaller merchants “it’s hard to get a small pizza shop to get concerned about fraud or security” he says predictably as a proactive decision maker in a reactive industry shanahan isn’t waiting for customers to ask for help with the new requirements cardconnect is pushing emv compliance while developing emvcompliant terminals and other solutions as quickly as possible if customers still need convincing shanahan can point to the target data breach

that resell cardconnect’s services a fifth brother is a cardiologist in pittsburgh naturally at shanahan family gatherings the talk inevitably centers on work “fortunately or unfortunately it always turns to business” says brian shanahan on the move the company remained in cleveland for more than six years before relocating to the philadelphia area shanahan says moving the company’s headquarters has been his biggest decision so far “with all due respect to cleveland it was very hard to find new talent there” he says “i never felt like we could get to the next level there” shanahan presented the move to the  employees in the cleveland and chicago offices as an opportunity to grow with the company “we knew we had big things ahead” he explains he was pleasantly surprised when the cleveland employees jumped at the chance although the chicago workforce was a harder sell the company renamed cardconnect offered generous relocation packages to those who wanted to move and separation packages to those who didn’t says shanahan the relocation cost cardconnect about  million which was a big hit for the company in the short term but will pay off in the long run brian shanahan points out king of prussia’s suburban location outside of philadelphia was a logical affordable choice on the east coast for the new headquarters shanahan says cardconnect still has an office in cleveland as well as offices in boca raton fl kansas city ks and denver co shanahan and his wife tara and their son and three daughters ranging in age from one to nine years old now live in devon pa best buys cardconnect’s strategy since its inception has been to grow quickly by buying other companies between  and  cardconnect bought nine companies around the country the acquisitions — one in  two in  one in  one in  and four in  — brought scale to cardconnect and reversed its negative cash flow “we were a small merchant service provider to a few thousand merchants back in  our first few acquisitions were done more out of necessity we needed to get bigger quickly” explains shanahan “until you get to scale you’re kind of always behind” each new purchase brought a new salesforce and customers on board enabling cardconnect to increase the number of transactions conducted a key measurement in the industry he points out as cardconnect grew its strategy became more selective as it began focusing more on technology and buying similar small providers of merchant services shanahan says the purchase of princeton payment solutions pps in  represented this focus and because pps is located in the princeton nj area it also reinforced the decision to move the company headquarters to the east coast shanahan explains the deal boosted cardconnect’s customer list with customers including general electric co and adobe systems inc pps brought cardconnect a tokenization process it had developed and patented for its fortune  customers tokenization involves replacing sensitive payment data with a unique identiﬁer known as a token which renders cardholder data unreadable and therefore useless to hackers according to cardconnect combining tokenization with pointtopoint encryption ppe — where plaintext card data is converted into cipher text at the time of collection — offers the best protection against data theft building a brand “when i look back most of our great decisions were made fairly quickly and based on our instincts” notes shanahan “when you’re growing fast nobody sits down with a playbook and scripts what you’re going to do with the company” rebranding the business for example was a swift and intuitive process in april  financial transaction services changed its name to reflect the company’s shift from working primarily with independent distributors to developing and selling its own products and services shanahan says he also wanted the new name to be the company’s url brainstorming sessions and consultations with a local public relations firm focused on what the new name should convey about the company and its business “it boiled down to ‘we connect card transactions’” says shanahan so the company settled on the name cardconnect tested it out and then ran with it too much analysis and planning can undermine the decisionmaking process says shanahan pointing out that “the more you analyze things and the more you think about things the more complex they get oftentimes the answer is sitting right in front of you” he advises others to simply “go with your gut and don’t overcomplicate things” mistakes will be made along the way of course but your decisionmaking track record will improve over time he adds shanahan admits it was easier to make quick instinctive moves when the organization was small because at that point the decisions were made “out of survival” in the early days management knew the company had to get bigger fast so they researched the best acquisition opportunities and then went out and bought those companies cardconnect could afford to take risks because it had less to lose he notes shanahan is known for his ability to make quick confident decisions confirms patrick shanahan  who became chief operating officer in  after joining cardconnect to help manage a new acquisition buying another company is already a long process without spending months hashing out details he says noting that jeff shanahan knows what’s important and what’s not in closing a deal a rapidly growing business needs a leader who is “nimble and can change directions quickly” patrick shanahan says “not everyone is cut out for it” test evaluate and pivot as cardconnect grew jeff shanahan says he started taking a more analytic approach to decision making “you don’t do things as fast as you did early on because you’re trying to do the ‘perfect’ acquisition or the ‘perfect’ deal” he explains the company pivoted its business strategy in  with the purchase of pps until then cardconnect primarily resold other companies’ processing services and payment gateways which capture the credit card information and send it to the processor in order to keep up with competitors cardconnect began providing its own payment solutions through pps the new strategy gave cardconnect a foothold in payment gateways which continue to be a dynamic developing part of the payment processing industry of course not all decisions work out as planned shanahan acknowledges cardconnect overextended itself in  when it bought four companies as the company struggled to absorb its new assets while continuing daytoday operations it took a needed break from acquisitions in  “you have to pace yourself a bit i think at certain times we tried to grow too fast” says shanahan “as a result of doing too many acquisitions at once we ended up with some problems” there’s only so much time and so many people to manage the issues that come up he notes shanahan says the organization is now ready to jump back in and is scouting potential firms “we are looking to buy” he says a bright future as cardconnect continues to create new security solutions for its customers its biggest upcoming challenge is helping customers comply with certain security mandates by their  deadlines us merchants adhere to standards for protecting payment card data set by the payment card industry pci pci is mandating the replacement of credit and debit cards that have a magnetic stripe on the back with cards embedded with emv chips that encrypt the card’s information “emv” stands for europay mastercard and visa the card issuers that first championed chipbased payment cards europe and canada got on board with the initiative right away but the us held off and is now playing catchup with the rest of the world says shanahan merchants must now have emvcompliant terminals to accept payment cards with emv chips by october  or face a shift in liability from the card issuer to the merchant shanahan considers the move to be too little too late “the emv thing is great but implementing it after the fact doesn’t help much” he says furthermore “the cost of converting to emv is a lot higher than it would have been  years ago” in advance of the deadline cardconnect is partnering with payment solution provider ingenico to offer customers emvcompliant payment acceptance devices integrated with cardconnect’s encryption technology says shanahan while cardconnect had no control over the timing of the migration to emv cards the company hopes to capitalize on the mandate by enticing customers to use pointtopoint encryption as well a second  deadline also looms pci is rolling out its latest data security standard dss known as pci dss  which governs the controls on sensitive data stored on credit debit and other types of cards to reduce data breaches and fraud among other things pci dss  will require merchants to be more vigilant about monitoring for security breaches pci dss  is being phased in over time but will officially take effect on july   once again the stricter pci dss  standard is a reaction to breaches that have already happened shanahan points out still cardconnect has its work cut out helping get customers on board with the new costly requirements particularly smaller merchants “it’s hard to get a small pizza shop to get concerned about fraud or security” he says predictably as a proactive decision maker in a reactive industry shanahan isn’t waiting for customers to ask for help with the new requirements cardconnect is pushing emv compliance while developing emvcompliant terminals and other solutions as quickly as possible if customers still need convincing shanahan can point to the target data breach as a recent example of what can happen if a business isn’t prepared ceo samantha drake is a

an independent public company we’re all very excited about this transition as it’s something we’ve been striving for and working hard to accomplish as a team so what does this mean other than being listed on the nasdaq under the symbol ccn it’s all business as usual the merger with fintech described in the announcement does not impact any of cardconnect’s business operations fintech is simply a special purpose acquisition company or spac which is a publiclytraded buyout company that raises money in order to acquire existing companies the merger is a transaction that allowed cardconnect to go public this merger creates opportunities for us to grow in many ways as we engage with even more businesses to determine evolving payment acceptance needs we will continue to develop and offer new products and solutions that will further simplify our clients’ payment processing all of this will be done backed by the high level of support we’ve always provided with the same management team in place we’ll also continue to attract talented and passionate individuals to the growing team everyone at cardconnect looks forward to expanding our franchise by helping merchants of all sizes we hope

gas stations are late to the chip card game a new report from krebsonsecurity analyzed the recent gas pump skimming device activity in new york which compromised customer credit card information at three different gas stations just this month gas stations are one of the last retailers to incorporate emv technology into their pumps leaving their terminals more vulnerable to theft in december visa adjusted their deadline from  to  for all fuel stations to adapt this technology delaying the shift even further us retailers have been adopting emv technology otherwise known as the “chip” card exponentially every year emv cards contain an embedded microchip which provides an extra layer of security on consumer data every time an emv card is used for payment the chip unlike the magnetic strip creates a unique transaction code that cannot be reused as of march  million chip cards have been issued to american consumers mastercard reports counterfeit fraud in terms of us dollars has dropped by over percent since enabling emv technology although slow to start the shift for fuel makers towards emv technology has officially began with the first fuel pump making company in the us successfully installing a chip card reader in their pumps gilbarco based in burlington nc announced in june the first emv chip card transaction from a fuel dispenser many gas stations provide emv terminals inside their stores but fail to include them on the actual gas pumps outside this year we’ve seen hackers seize the opportunity to infect gas pumps with credit card skimming devices targeting the magnetic stripe on customer’s cards the cost and physical installation of the terminals have been the biggest pains for gas stations looking to implement emv technology according to gray taylor executive director of connexus about a third of the  pump dispensers are too old and would need to be replaced in order to accept chip cards the average price for a replacement unit  – and that’s not including the price of new hardware and software gas stations may have to install in order to support emv jared scheeler managing director of the hub convenience stores inc stated it had cost his chain of four north dakota convenience stores  to install pointofsale and pump devices that accept emv transactions overall convenience stores and gas stations would have to spend over  billion to integrate emv technology into their machines another challenge that lies within gas station’s quest for emv is a federal regulation which requires a technician to perform a safety check each time a gas station replaces a fueldispenser the technicians licensed to do this are short in supply and may give priority to large retailers over small stores these challenges are a few of the reasons visa has extended its deadline for all fuel stations to revamp their pumps but what’s at stake for gas stations skimming vulnerabilities and data threats widen without the usage of emv merchants of visa who are emvenabled saw a percent decline in counterfeit fraud which would likely carry over to gas stations according to bloomberg fuel retailers currently see about  billion in fraud annually krebsonsecurity said gas station skimming fraud makes up for  percent of total us card fraud – and in august  certain stations saw more skimming in a single month than the entire prior year as other payment outlets and terminals become more secure it’s probable to suspect fraudsters to harp on weak and unprotected pos terminals to mitigate fraud with three years to go before the liability shift visa and mastercard have introduced fraud prevention tools such as the visa transaction advisor which has been “particularly successful in driving fraud lower at fuel dispensers” according to a visa spokesperson gas pumps would potentially benefit most from emv’s antifraud technology as they’re unattended devices but it’s important to remember that emv is only a piece of the complete security puzzle in the meantime merchants are focusing on the use of tokenization and pointtopoint encryption ppe  both methods which bolster security with ppe customers’ payment data is encrypted instantly at point of capture and is protected throughout the complete lifecycle of a transaction tokenization assigns random values to payment data making it almost impossible for hackers to access the data itself do you have a payments trend or regulation you want us to look into drop us a line in the comments and we would be happy to help read more taylor havlisch data security jul   five crucial ways to help keep a system safe from harm last week our chief security officer rush taggart was featured on online security news outlet help net security as a contributor to the “expert corner” there he shared a few of his best tips for helping to keep a network safe from harm aka data breaches attempted data breaches occur everyday and unfortunately for the victims many are “successful” which is why it’s important to understand the steps that can be taken to reduce the chances of a breach having an impact on your business or organization we don’t want to give too much away because the full article is wellworth the read but to get you started we’ve included the highlights below  dont keep data around the overcollection of data can clog a system and even lead losing track of information  archive the important stuff you really only need to keep the daytoday stuff around and put away the older data that can be pulled only when needed  segment your network make sure your network’s data is isolated and can only be accessed by a few staff members  sanitize sensitive data with tokens protect sensitive data with tokenization so in the event that your system is hacked the information will be useless to the hacker  put someone in charge appoint a manager or team to oversee the security plan in place and assess when updates are needed get the rest here five crucial ways to help keep a system safe from harm rush has played an integral part in the development of cardconnect’s payment processing and security solutions building and rebuilding applications in order to add significant user functionality and portability in  cardconnect was awarded two patents related to payment security that were a direct result of taggart’s work he also developed the cardpointe terminal which our small to medium sized business customers know and love that provides a pcivalidated ppe solution that is also emvready read more ellie delany data security jun   an autopsy of the  target breach it’s been almost four years since the infamous black friday data breach occurred at target stores across the nation compromising over  million credit and debit card numbers last month target reached an milliondollar multistate settlement requiring they employ an executive to oversee a comprehensive security program the company is also required to hire a thirdparty which will encrypt and protect card information ensuring their data is secured and unreadable if accessed target is now adopting appropriate measures to keep their customer’s information safe – but what was lacking before we’ve compiled a comprehensive autopsy diagnosing several factors and components which led to target’s massive hack what exactly happened according to krebs on security who first reported the news of target the breach involved the acquiring of customer information stored in the magnetic strip on the back of their payment cards undetectable malware was installed on a number of pointofsale systems in a short amount of time which indicates the software may have been installed via an automatic updating process the attackers completed their hack by accessing one of target’s third party vendors a refrigerator contractor fazio mechanical the vendor accessing target’s systems was not using adequate antimalware software and their lack of segregation between networks led to the compromise of millions of customers’ information we can conclude a few things from this target’s systems were not protected but vulnerable to phishing attacks networks were not adequately segregated and several previous warnings were overlooked what’s interesting to consider about the target breach is the fact that target passed pci compliance audits prior to the breach target had implemented security methods required by the pci security council as told by the sans institute reading room “a comprehensive approach to security will consider all assets not just those that fall under compliance regulations each asset has a specific set of threats and vulnerabilities that can be considered as part of a risk management program rather than simply implementing what is mandated for a subset of assets as demonstrated in this breach many different assets were used to move throughout the network so consideration of the pos systems alone would not address the root causes that led up to this attack” what target did wrong as malware attacks are often unpredictable and randomized there are few things a company can do to prevent a hack how a company responds to a malware infection makes a considerable difference in how an attack impact their customers and business initial response is crucial to the minimizing of a malware attack and is also one of the areas where target underperformed target missed several internal alerts and only found out about their breach when contacted by the department of justice their monitoring software fireeye alerted target staff in bangalore india who in turn notified staff in minneapolis but no action was taken despite the fact that target reportedly spent a large sum on security technology utilizing encryption their data was accessed in memory where it was unencrypted damages to the company while target remains affected by the results of the breach today the company faced major losses at the time of occurrence setting them back greatly during the holiday season after profits dropped  percent during q of  customer visits plunged during the new year prolonging target’s losses high ranking employees including target’s ceo lost their jobs and over  lawsuits were filed in three years the huffington post estimates the breach has cost  million so far including the costs for banks to reissue  million cards how it could have been prevented a multilayered security strategy would have prevented if not at least mitigated the detrimental effects of this breach on target and its customers target’s strategy focused mainly on pci compliance while there are sometimes risks which fall outside of the scope of pci requirements standards may also inform adversaries which security measures a business has implemented so the attacker will capitalize on vulnerabilities not on the pci compliance checklist as also stated by the sans reading room “for encryption to be effective you must employ an indepth defense strategy in which you also protect the key and protect access to systems where the data needs to be unencrypted in order to be processed” in the instance of the target breach tokenization would have played a crucial role in protecting consumer’s information rather than relying on basic encryption methods the customer information would have been replaced with unique irreversible tokens – unable to be accessed and decoded by hackers an emv terminal accepting chip cards could have also prevented the theft of information via the magnetic strip on the back of cards cardconnect’s cardpointe and bolt terminals protects instore transactions as all sensitive data is instantly encrypted and tokenized upon entry the terminal accepts both cards with magnetic strips and emv chips utilizing pcivalidated pointtopoint encryption ppe for each individual transaction all transactions captured with the cardpointe and bolt terminals appear in the powerful transaction management portal cardpointe in realtime making it easy to accept and manage payments while being away from the device cardpointe also keeps its users apprised of the status of their business’s level of pci compliance it’s important for merchants to understand that the range of security threats can be wider than standard pci compliance monitoring networks and being attentive to disruptive or unusual patterns in a system’s network is crucial to protecting their systems – and in turn customer data target is just one of many companies to have faced a major data breach make sure your company or business is protecting your customers
