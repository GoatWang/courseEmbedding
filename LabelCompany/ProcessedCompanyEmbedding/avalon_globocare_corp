my hand this  day of           signature            exhibit a  risk factors   risks related to our business   our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance    we did not begin operations of our business through avalon healthcare system inc “ahs” our whollyowned subsidiary until may   we have a limited operating history and have not generated revenue  as a consequence it is difficult if not impossible to forecast our future results based upon our historical data  reliance on the historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve particularly in our combined form  because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses  if we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data we could be less profitable or incur losses which may result in a decline in our stock price   ahs’s results of operations have not resulted in profitability and we may not be able to achieve profitability going forward   ahs incurred a net loss amounting to  for the nine months ended september     if we incur additional significant operating losses our stock price may decline perhaps significantly our management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above  our business plan is speculative and unproven there is no assurance that we will be successful in executing our business plan or that even if we successfully implement our business plan that we will be able to curtail our losses now or in the future further as we are a new enterprise we expect that net losses will continue and our working capital deficiency will exacerbate   we depend upon key personnel and need additional personnel   our success depends on the continuing services of wenzhao lu david jin and meng li our executive officers and directors  the loss of mr lu dr jin or ms li could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations additionally the success of the company’s operations will largely depend upon its ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key management personnel as with any company with limited resources there can be no guaranty that the company will be able to attract such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for the company  our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations   we have entered into three consulting agreements with related parties  the loss of such customers could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations    as of june   ahs received an aggregate of  of prepayments from customers for services that had not yet been provided wenzhao lu our chairman and significant shareholder is the chairman of each of the three clients that provided the prepayments we maintain close working relationships with our three customers the loss of any one major customer would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation the loss of more than one such major customer or our failure to replace such customer with other customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations            our auditors have issued a “going concern” audit opinion   our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our december   financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern a “going concern” opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern therefore you should not rely on our balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of liquidation   we must effectively manage the growth of our operations or our company will suffer   to manage our growth we believe we must continue to implement and improve our services we may not have adequately evaluated the costs and risks associated with our planned expansion and our systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations in addition our management may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer our products and services and implement our business plan on a profitable basis the success of our future operating activities will also depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business any failure by our management to effectively anticipate implement and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our business requires substantial capital and if we are unable to maintain adequate financing sources our profitability and financial condition will suffer and jeopardize our ability to continue operations   in connection with the strategic development portion of our business we will need significant capital in order to implement acquisitions of real estate or technologies in addition we will need a significant amount of capital in order to fully implement our advisory business in order to fully grow our technology base and employee base if we are unable to maintain adequate financing or other sources of capital are not available we could be forced to suspend curtail or reduce our operations which could harm our revenues profitability financial condition and business prospects            our revenue and results of operations may suffer if we are unable to attract new clients continue to engage existing client or sell additional products and services   we presently derive our revenue from annual consulting fees our growth therefore depends on our ability to attract new clients maintain existing clients and sell additional products and services to existing clients this depends on our ability to understand and anticipate market and pricing trends and our clients’ needs and our ability to deliver consistent reliable highquality services if we fail to engage new clients continue to reengage with our existing clients or to crosssell additional services our results could be materially and adversely affect our operating results   if we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining current members   our professional reputation is an important factor in attracting and retaining our members and in building relationships with the progressive health care and education organizations that supply many of the best practices we feature in our research we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining members promotion and enhancement of our reputation will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective solutions our brand name and reputation will suffer and our ability to attract new members or retain existing members could be adversely affected if members do not perceive our solutions to be effective or of high quality or if there are inaccuracies or defects in our solutions   if we are not able to offer new and valuable products and services our business may suffer   our success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and services that serve specific constituencies to anticipate changing market trends and to adapt our research and analysis to meet the changing needs of our clients we may not be able to provide helpful and timely research and analysis of developments and trends in a manner that meets market needs any such failure could cause some of our existing products and services to become obsolete this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with timely consulting and management services for issues and topics of importance as a result we must continue to invest resources in development of new services in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new highquality products and services that will appeal to members and potential members if we are not able to offer new and valuable products and services our business may suffer   our prospects will suffer if we are not able to hire train motivate manage and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees   we only recently commenced business and we presently only have three clients wenzhao lu our chairman and significant shareholder is the chairman of each of the three clients that provided the prepayments our future success depends upon our ability to hire train motivate manage and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees particularly research analysts technical experts and sales and marketing staff we will experience competition for professional personnel from management consulting firms and other healthcare firms hiring training motivating managing and retaining employees with the skills we need is time consuming and expensive any failure by us to address our staffing needs in an effective manner could hinder our ability to continue to provide highquality products and services and to grow our business            we may experience significant delays in generating or an inability to generate revenue if potential clients take a long time to evaluate our products and services   our sales strategy is to market our products and services directly to health care organizations if we are unable to sell additional products and services to our existing clients or engage new clients our ability to increase our revenue could be materially adversely affected generally speaking the sales cycle is extensive for our clients we do not control many of the factors that will influence the decisions of these organizations regarding the purchase of our products and services the evaluation process sometimes can be lengthy and involve significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations the use of our products and services also may be delayed due to reluctance to change or modify existing procedures   potential liability claims may adversely affect our business   our services which may include recommendations and advice to organizations regarding complex business and operational processes regulatory and compliance issues and labor practices may give rise to liability claims by our clients or by third parties who bring claims against our clients healthcare organizations often are the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation and we also may become the subject of such litigation based on our advice and services any such litigation whether or not resulting in a judgment against us may adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us   in accordance with our strategic development policy we may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments   from time to time we may make investments in companies these investments may be for strategic objectives to support our key business initiatives but may also be stand alone investments or acquisitions such investments or acquisitions could include equity or debt instruments in private companies many of which may be not be marketable at the time of our initial investment these companies may range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of these companies may depend on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fails we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that impairment indicators exist and that there are otherthantemporary declines in the fair value of the investments we may be required to write down the investments to their fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss            our growing operations in the prc could expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our costs of operations   our client base is presently located in the prc we intend to grow this client base in the prc as well as the united states as a result we expect to continue to add personnel in the prc with a significant focus of our operations in the prc our reliance on a workforce in the prc exposes us to disruptions in the business political and economic environment in that region maintenance of a stable political environment between the prc and the united states is important to our operations and any disruption in this relationship may directly negatively affect our operations our operations in the prc require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk our operations may also be subject to reduced or inadequate protection of our intellectual property rights and security breaches further it may be difficult to transfer funds from our chinese operations to our us parent company negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business   we face intense competition which could cause us to lose market share   in the healthcare markets in the united states and the peoples republic of china we will compete with large healthcare providers who have more significant financial resources established market positions longstanding relationships and who have more significant name recognition technical marketing sales distribution financial and other resources than we do the resources available to our competitors to develop new services and products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to us this intense competitive environment may require us to make changes in our services products pricing licensing services distribution or marketing to develop a market position   our success is heavily dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights   we rely on trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology our success will in part depend on our ability to obtain trademarks and patents we presently do not hold patents registered with the united states patent and trademark office or the prc state intellectual property office although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants we cannot be certain that others will not gain access to these trade secrets others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets            we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act and any determination that we violated the foreign corrupt practices act or chinese anticorruption law could have a material adverse effect on our business   we are subject to the foreign corrupt practice act or fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business chinese anticorruption law also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials we have operations agreements with third parties and make sales in china where corruption may occur our activities in china create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees consultants sales agents or distributors of our company even though these parties are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguards to prevent these practices by our employees however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and the employees consultants sales agents or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible   violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition the united states government may seek to hold our company liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire   our status as an emerging growth company may result in reduced disclosure obligations   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act which we refer to as the “jobs act” and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and financial disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to  not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  the “sarbanesoxley act”  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and  exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we intend to take advantage of these exemptions because of the reduced disclosure and because our business is conducted in the prc investors may find investing in our common shares less attractive as a result which could have an adverse effect on our stock price   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we elected to opt out of such extended transition period and acknowledge such election is irrevocable pursuant to section  of the jobs act   we could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of  the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion  the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least  months or  the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding threeyear period            risks related to doing business in china   if we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny criticism and negative publicity involving certain uslisted chinese companies we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved quickly   recently us public companies that have substantially all of their operations in china particularly companies like us which have completed socalled reverse merger transactions have been the subject of intense scrutiny criticism and negative publicity by investors short sellers financial commentators and regulatory agencies such as the united states securities and exchange commission much of the scrutiny criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and in many cases allegations of fraud as a result of the scrutiny criticism and negative publicity the publicly traded stock of many us listed chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and in some cases has become virtually worthless many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits sec enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations it is not clear what affect this sectorwide scrutiny criticism and negative publicity will have on our company our business and our stock price if we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations andor defend our company this situation could be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company if such allegations are not proven to be groundless our company and business operations will be severely impacted and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless   adverse changes in political and economic policies of the prc government could impede the overall economic growth of china which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business   presently we generate our revenue in china although we intend to pursue various opportunities in the united states and our headquarters is based in the united states accordingly our business financial condition results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic political and legal developments in china the prc economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including   · the higher level of government involvement · the early stage of development of the marketoriented sector of the economy · the rapid growth rate · the higher level of control over foreign exchange and · the allocation of resources            as the prc economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more marketoriented economy the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources while these measures may benefit the overall prc economy they may also have a negative effect on us or the healthcare industry in general   although the prc government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform the prc government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in china through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways   any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in china could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of new healthcare investments and expenditures in china which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our services and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects   uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us   we conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary in the prc our operating subsidiary is generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in china and in particular laws applicable to foreigninvested enterprises the prc legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value since  a series of new prc laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in china however since the prc legal system continues to rapidly evolve the interpretations of many laws regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws regulations and rules involve uncertainties which may limit legal protections available to you and us in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention in addition all of our executive officers and almost all of our directors are residents of china and not of the united states and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the united states as a result it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the united states or to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states against our chinese operations and subsidiary   the prc government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities   the prc government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership our ability to operate in china may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations we believe that our operations in china are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements however the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations            accordingly government actions in the future including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies could have a significant effect on economic conditions in china or particular regions thereof   we may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations implemented on september     the recent prc regulation on mergers and acquisitions of domestic companies by foreign investors also governs the approval process by which a prc company may participate in an acquisition of its assets or its equity interests depending on the structure of the transaction the new regulation will require the chinese parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies in some instances the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses accordingly due to the new regulation our ability to engage in business combination transactions is extremely complicated time consuming and expensive and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction   the new regulation allows prc government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to mofcom and the other government agencies an appraisal report an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement all of which form part of the application for approval depending on the structure of the transaction the regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the chinese business or assets and in certain transaction structures require that consideration must be paid within defined periods generally not in excess of a year the regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition including aspects of the initial consideration contingent consideration holdback provisions indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities transaction structures involving trusts nominees and similar entities are prohibited therefore such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders’ economic interests            under the current enterprise income tax or eit law we may be classified as a resident enterprise of china such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our nonprc stockholders   we are a holding company incorporated under the laws of delaware we conduct substantially all of our business through our whollyowned subsidiaries and we derive all of our income from these entities prior to january   dividends derived by foreign enterprises from business operations in china were not subject to the chinese enterprise income tax however such tax exemption ceased as of january   and thereafter with the effectiveness of the new enterprise income tax law or eit law   under the eit law if we are not deemed to be a “resident enterprise” for chinese tax purposes a withholding tax at the rate of  would be applicable to any dividends paid by our chinese subsidiaries to us however if we are deemed to be a “resident enterprise” established outside of china whose “place of effective management” is located in china we would be classified as a resident enterprise for chinese tax purposes and thus would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of  on all of our income including interest income on the proceeds from this offering on a worldwide basis   the regulations promulgated pursuant to the eit law define the term “place of effective management” as “establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations personnel accounting properties etc of an enterprise” the state administration of taxation issued a sat circular  on april   which provides that the “place of effective management” of a chinesecontrolled overseasincorporated enterprise is located in china if the following requirements are satisfied i the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly located in the prc ii its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies located in the prc iii its major assets accounting books company seals and minutes and files of its board and shareholders’ meetings are located or kept in the prc and iv no less than half of the enterprise’s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the prc sat circular  applies only to overseas registered enterprises controlled by prc enterprises not to those controlled by prc individuals if the company’s nonprc incorporated entities are deemed prc tax residents such entities would be subject to prc tax under the eit law the company has analyzed the applicability of the eit law and related regulations and for each of the applicable periods presented the company has not accrued for prc tax on such basis in addition although under the eit law and the related regulations dividends paid to us by our prc subsidiaries would qualify as “taxexempted income” we cannot assure you that such dividends will not be subject to a  withholding tax as the prc foreign exchange control authorities which enforce the withholding tax have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes as a result of such changes our historical operating results will not be indicative of our operating results for future periods and the value of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected we are actively monitoring the possibility of “resident enterprise” treatment and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment to the extent possible            we may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our chinese employees fail to comply with prc regulations relating to employee stock options granted by overseas listed companies to prc citizens   on december   the people’s bank of china issued the administration measures on individual foreign exchange control and its implementation rules were issued by the state administration of foreign exchange “safe” on january   both took effect on february   under these regulations all foreign exchange matters involved in an employee stock holding plan stock option plan or similar plan in which prc citizens’ participation requires approval from the safe or its authorized branch on march   the safe issued the application procedure for foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals participating in employee stock holding plans or stock option plans of overseas listed companies or notice  under notice  prc individuals who participate in an employee stock option holding plan or a stock option plan of an overseas listed company are required through a prc domestic agent or prc subsidiary of the overseas listed company to register with the safe and complete certain other procedures we and our chinese employees who have been granted shares or stock options pursuant to our share incentive plan are subject to notice  however in practice there are significant uncertainties with regard to the interpretation and implementation of notice  we are committed to complying with the requirements of notice  however we cannot provide any assurance that we or our chinese employees will be able to qualify for or obtain any registration required by notice  in particular if we andor our chinese employees fail to comply with the provisions of notice  we andor our chinese employees may be subject to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the safe or other prc government authorities as a result of which our business operations and employee option plans could be materially and adversely affected   the new ma rules establish more complex procedures for some acquisitions of chinese companies by foreign investor which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in china   the new ma rules that became effective on september   established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more timeconsuming and complex including requirements in some instances that the ministry of commerce be notified in advance of any changeofcontrol transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a prc domestic enterprise complying with the requirements of the ma rules to complete such transactions could be timeconsuming and any required approval processes including obtaining approval from the ministry of commerce may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions which could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business through acquisitions in china   risks relating to our securities   we may not be able to attract the attention of brokerage firms because we became a public company by means of a reverse acquisition   because we became public through a “reverse acquisition” securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock no assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of the company in the future            there are restrictions on the transferability of our shares of common stock   existing shareholders and investors that participate in this offering cannot offer sell pledge or otherwise transfer the shares unless subsequently registered pursuant to or exempt from registration under the securities act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations you may rely on the exemption from registration provided by rule  of the securities act “rule ” subject to certain restrictions starting one year after i the completion of a business combination with a private company in a reverse merger or reverse takeover transaction after which the company would cease to be a “shell company” as defined in rule b under the exchange act and ii the disclosure of certain information on a current report on form k within four business days thereafter and iii the company has been current in all of its periodic sec filings for the  months preceding the contemplated sale of stock we acquired ahs through a reverse merger and were considered a shell corporation prior to such acquisition we filed the super k disclosing the acquisition of ahs on october     compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the securities act or state securities laws there can be no assurance that we will fulfill any reporting requirements in the future under the exchange act or disseminate to the public any current financial or other information concerning us as is required by rule  as part of the conditions of our availability   we presently trade on the otcqb if we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements we could be removed from the otcqb which would limit the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market   companies trading on the otcqb such as us must be reporting issuers under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended and must be current in their reports under section  in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the otcqb if we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements we could be removed from the otcqb as a result the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market in addition we may be unable to get relisted on the otcqb which may have an adverse material effect on our company   applicable regulatory requirements including those contained in and issued under the sarbanesoxley act of  may make it difficult for the company to retain or attract qualified officers and directors which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of its common stock   the company may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies including but not limited to certifications by principal executive officers the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the sec as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges the perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers            further some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange assuming the company elects to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing could be adversely affected   if the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or detect fraud consequently investors could lose confidence in the company’s financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of its stock   the company must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud the company has been assessing its internal controls to identify areas that need improvement it is in the process of implementing changes to internal controls but has not yet completed implementing these changes failure to implement these changes to the company’s internal controls or any others that it identifies as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm its operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in the company’s reported financial information any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the trading price of the company’s stock   voting power of our shareholders is highly concentrated by insiders   our officers and directors and affiliates own approximately  of our outstanding common shares such concentrated control of the company may adversely affect the value of our common shares if you acquire our common shares you may have no effective voice in our management sales by our insiders or affiliates along with any other market transactions could affect the value of our common shares   our certificate of incorporation allow for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock   our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock our board of directors have the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock terms of which may be determined by the board without further stockholder approval as a result our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common stock in addition our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock we may issue such shares in the future            you may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional common shares   in the future we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our shareholders we may also issue additional shares of our securities that are convertible into or exercisable for ordinary shares as the case may be in connection with hiring or retaining employees future acquisitions future sales of its securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes the future issuance of any such additional shares may create downward pressure on the value of our securities there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts including at a price or exercise prices below the price at which our shares may be valued or are trading in a public market   we have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future  any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock   we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future the payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant if we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates   our stock price and trading volume may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders   the equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities the market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business our industry or our operating performance and financial condition in addition the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur we have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock over the past few years we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in addition the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations            we have not voluntary implemented various corporate governance measures in the absence of which shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions conflict of interest and similar matters   recent federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics while we intend to adopt certain corporate governance measures such as a code of ethics and established an audit committee nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee of our board of directors we presently do not have any independent directors we intend to expand our board membership in future periods to include independent directors it is possible that if we were to have independent directors on our board stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct for example in the absence of audit nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of both corporate governance measures and independent directors in formulating their investment decisions   if a public market for our common stock develops trading will be limited under the sec’s penny stock regulations which will adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock   the trading price of our common stock is less than  per share and as a result our common stock is considered a penny stock and trading in our common stock would be subject to the requirements of rule g under the exchange act under this rule brokerdealers who recommend lowpriced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements generally the brokerdealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written consent prior to the transaction   sec regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a penny stock including the delivery prior to any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks these requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities in addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market an active and liquid market in our common stock may never develop due to these factors            risks related to this offering   the offering price for the common stock
