you entertain and how many people usually attend a large dining table might be worth it if lots of family and friends live nearby while a smaller table might fit better with your space and social life if you like having options purchase one with a table leaf so you can accommodate both large and small parties to add a more trendy feel try mismatched chairs or a metal table or go traditional with an allwood set in the end pick what works for your family budget and overall stylemake entertaining easy with a buffet tablewhen a dining room and kitchen are separate going back to the kitchen for seconds can seem like quite a trek instead of forcing guests to make the move bring the food to them by investing in a buffet table with a sideboard you can place all the food in one spot so that guests can conveniently pick at their leisure because its also another flat surface you can use it for decorations candles vases and picture frames toocreate your own home bar stationno good party is complete without a bar but if a custom builtin is out of reach and out of your price range you can still get the same effect by piecing together your own station a bar cart is a great option because it’s portable and can be conveniently squeezed into any corner just stock it with all the necessities — cocktail shaker ice bucket barware and alcohol of your choice — and your guests can just help themselvesdress up your dining room with table linenswhen you’re hosting a party one of the best ways to add character is to pick the right table linens during a formal dinner party nothing says “elegant” more than ivory linen napkins napkin rings and a satin tablecloth or it might not feel quite like christmas without red and green napkins and a lovely christmas tablecloth by owning a wide variety of table linens you will be prepared for everything even your little kid’s messy birthday party besides being above all practical having a variety of napkins and tablecloths is a great way to bring some personality and decor to your table without seeming over the topensure that your dinnerware fits the billas with table linens make sure you have dinnerware that complements a wide variety of events you can store your fancy dishes and glassware in a corner china cabinet if you like and only bring them out for special formal events for a more laidback fingerfood party substitute trendy

legs found under chairs and tables with four legs he worked first with hundreds of drawings which were followed by ¼ scale models since the compelling idea was to design chairs that looked good in a room the model furniture was set up in a scaled model room the size of a doll house drawing on his early training as a sculptor saarinen refined his design through full scale models endlessly modifying the shape with clay “what interests me is when and where to use these structural plastic shapes probing even more deeply into different possibilities one finds many different shapes are equally logical—some ugly some exciting some earthbound some soaring the choices really become a sculptor’s choice” saarinen was assisted by don petitt of knoll’s design development group who introduced several ingenious methods of model making together with a knoll design research team they worked out the problems arising in production full scale models became furniture and with family and friends acting as “guinea pigs” the furniture was tested in the dining room and living room of the saarinen house in bloomfield hills discover knoll stone born to world famous architect and cranbrook academy of art director eliel saarinen and textile artist loja saarinen eero saarinen was surrounded by design his whole life by the time he was in his teens eero was helping his father design furniture and fixtures for the cranbrook campus after studying sculpture in paris and architecture at yale saarinen returned to cranbrook in  it was at cranbrook that saarinen met charles eames the two young men both committed to exploring new materials and processes quickly became great friends and creative collaborators they worked together on several projects most notably their groundbreaking collection of molded plywood chairs for  competition organic design in home furnishings sponsored by moma at cranbrook saarinen also met florence knoll who at that time was a promising young protégé of eliel saarinen when florence joined knoll in the s she invited eero to design for the company saarinen went on to design many of knolls most recognizable pieces including the tulip chairs and tables the womb chair and the  series of seating in addition to these achievements saarinen became a leader of the secondgeneration modernists among his outstanding projects are the dulles international airport in washington dc the gateway arch in st louis and new yorks cbs building and twa terminal at kennedy international airport more in the saarinen collection related products my
