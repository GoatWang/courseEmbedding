the credit risk of the issuer open an account reasons to consider structured products market participation access to alternative asset classes intent to hold until maturity find new issue structured products find structured productslog in required structured products from fidelity fidelity currently offers new issue structured products that are either marketlinked eg equity or currency indexes certificates of deposit which carry fdic insurance protection on the invested principal subject to fdic coverage limits  per account owner per institution or senior unsecured obligations of the issuer which are not fdicinsured how they work features  benefits risks examples types how they work as with any new issue offering prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period at issuance customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted however submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation if the offering is oversubscribed more securities were requested than available for purchase and you did not withdraw your order you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested or none at all further if the offering is undersubscribed the offering can be pulled investments in structured products that are fdicinsured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank this underlying cd provides the fdic protection on this investment nonfdicinsured structured products have no cd issuance with these investments which are unsecured debt customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer components of fidelity’s structured products the structured products offered through fidelitycom include the following components payout profile fidelity currently offers only a pointtopoint payout profile a payout profile represents how a customers cumulative return is measured the return of the structured products available on fidelitycom is measured based on two points point a initial or starting index level which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date and point b final index level which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document the product will provide its investment return based on the following formula final index level – starting index level starting index level certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a cap or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket see below participation rate the potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate if the participation rate of the structured product is less than  the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket for example if the participation rate is  the investor will receive only  of any positive return on the index or basket assuming no other limits on return potential the participation rate will vary by product and factors such as index type maturity and caps affect the rate cap a cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket in other words if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return for example if a structured product allows for  participation in an index subject to a  cap the investor cannot earn more than  on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that costs and fees placement fees structuring development and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing taxes structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes this means youll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity in addition any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details features  benefits market participation investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index but is subject to issuer credit and default risk access to alternative asset classes investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access risks credit and default risk structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer therefore the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product in summary if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy the investor may lose all or some of the investment in the case of fdicinsured marketlinked cds deposit amounts exceeding applicable fdic coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank other limitations on fdic coverage may apply structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not fdicinsured in the event of issuer default on a nonfdicinsured product repayment of principal would be subject to the issuers restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed limited fdic protection for fdicinsured marketlinked cds fdic coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not fdicinsured if you hold more than the fdicinsured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank you will not receive the benefit of fdic insurance for any balance in excess of fdic limits in this instance amounts in excess of fdicinsured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank liquidity risk structured products are intended to be held until maturity due to a limited secondary market it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity additionally should a secondary market exist investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss market or opportunity risk the potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket the return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security derivatives risk the issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives andor trading in one or more instruments such as options swaps or futures the costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market commodity price risk if the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile the performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities currency and exchange rate risk if the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket you may be subject to foreign currency risks the value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits domestic and foreign inflation rates domestic and foreign interest rates and global or regional political regulatory economic or financial events performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates examples the scenarios presented below are hypothetical actual investment performance may differ in all cases return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor scenario  the index rises assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index in this scenario the index rose  over the life of the structured product in other words it was up  between purchase date and maturity further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate given these conditions the return to the investor would be   ×  ×  so at maturity the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  index return amount for a total of  scenario  the index falls in this scenario assume return is again tied to the performance of the sp ® index but in this case the index falls  over the life of the structured product the customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product assuming it was  then regardless of how far the index fell the customer would receive a full return ie  of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term in this example the customer invested  and would receive it back at maturity scenario  a capped return in this final scenario again assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index assume again that the index rose  over the life of the structured product further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate finally assume a cap of  given these conditions the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of   ×  ×  or the cap amount of   ×  so in this scenario the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  cap index return amount for a total of  these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security taxes inflation fees andor expenses were not taken into account if they had been deducted performance would have been lower past performance is not a guarantee of future results your performance will vary and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity before you start you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples types type

morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

percentile when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more fund risk and return as
