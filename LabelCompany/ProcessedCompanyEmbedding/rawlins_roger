and jared poff chief financial officer let me now turn the call over to roger roger rawlins thanks christina and good morning i’d like to begin today by discussing a few highlights from our first quarter and progress we’ve made against our  priorities i will then turn the call over to jared who will provide a financial update at the dsw brand we saw continued strength in our leisure distortion to atleisure however women’s dress men’s dress and accessories were soft from an inventory perspective we pulled back casual sandals and invested in athletic and women’s dress it is played out well in athletic but not as well in womens dress and as a result we are rightsizing our dress inventory while chasing the casual sandals as we address the challenged areas of our core business we are also focused on assembling an experienced merchandising leadership team we promoted jim weinberg to dsws gmm of womens footwear after two successful years leading our affiliated business group as general manager jim has vast merchandising experience across multiple retailers and im thrilled to have jim leading our largest category weve experienced several years of negative comps in womens its time to change that trend and im confident in jims ability to make that happen in addition weve recruited nancy pastor a seasoned executive in merchant from the department store in offprice channels as dsws new gmm of accessories these proven leaders bring significant expertises that will drive womens and accessories back to position the strength that we know they can be im also very excited to welcome michele love to our executive team as evp and chief operating officer michele had a strong and distinguishing career at nordstrom most recently spearheading heading the expansion of nordstrom rack mitchell will oversee all engagement with our dsw customer including our digital experience weve recently launched our redesigned websites and mobile app which drove a significant improvement in online conversion and user engagement as digital exerts in increasingly larger influence over retail sales we expect these platforms to expand dsws online presence and accelerate digital demand growth michele will also be overseeing marketing and the operation of our nationwide fleet of warehouses by combining oversight of these critical areas under one leader we will provide messaging engagement and storytelling united across all touchpoints our power store initiatives delivered encouraging q results we have now closed the gap between our power stores and the balance of the chain and we expect performance to improve with ongoing focus and actions as the year progresses finally during the first quarter we also undertook the transition of gordmans and continued our integration of ebuys following the bankruptcy filing of gordmans weve been working through residual inventories through gob sales as well as transitioning several locations over the stage stores additionally we are liquidating some of our excess inventory through ebuys this is just one example of how we begun to leverage ebuys across our brand portfolio by making key infrastructure investments to unlock more synergies in the near future now let me turn the call over to jared jared poff thanks roger and good morning everyone we remain focused on managing the business in a challenging retail environment sales increased  to  million driven by a  growth at ebuys and stable revenues from our organic segments reported earnings were  per share which included the following  million pretax expense from foreign exchange transaction loss on canadian dollar investments related to the future funding of our upcoming town shoes acquisition  pretax from our cost restructuring initiative and  million pretax from the amortization of intangible assets and change in contingent consideration liability related to ebuys acquisition when we exclude these items adjusted earnings per share were  the rest of our comments will refer to adjusted results while first quarter comps declined  i was happy to see performance improved coming out of the quarter with april comps turning positive even after adjusting for the easter timing shift digital demand percentage growth was in the highteens and our store fulfillment of digital orders increased by  and was just shy of  of all digital orders this quarter the enhance digital experience from our relaunched website is lifting demand conversions and reducing cart abandonment leading to dramatically improved checkout rates in our desktop and mobile sites transactions at the dsw segment increased in the lowsingledigits led by an increase in traffic which outperformed the industry benchmark by  basis points aur and upt contributed to lower average seller sales turning to our abg group comps decline by  this quarter given the noncomparable activity occurring within the gordmans stores due to the gob sales and the transition to stage we have removed the chain from the comp base we closed  gordmans locations at the end of the first quarter and plan to exit another  to  locations at the beginning of the second quarter we will transition the footwear departments at the  to  stores acquired by stage stores during the remainder of the year additionally we are clearing excess inventory and select dsw locations and ebuys in order to maximize recovery value including a net new three new stein mart locations the abg division ended the quarter with  locations at ebuys we continue to make progress establishing new direct relationships with branded vendors which will improve the flow of inventory to ebuys well further enhancing dsws endtoend relationships with the vendor community i am pleased with the new partnerships we have forged with vendors who have agreed to work with us across all of our matters which improves our sourcing leverage significantly we expect this number to grow as dsw inc continues to increased market share in this consolidate footwear market we started the process of transitioning ebuys existing fulfillment centers into one larger new facility in nashville tennessee we are taking measures to ensure as little disruption as possible and expect to complete this project during the third quarter there is new supply chain capabilities will allow ebuys to accelerate growth during the important holiday season and beyond turning to gross profit total company gross profit declined by  basis points with  basis points from merchandised margins and  basis points from fulfillment and distribution costs we optimized the timing of clearance activity this year reverting back to our legacy cadence of six rotations per year three in the spring and three in the fall as planned we added a rotation to the first quarter which accounted for the majority of our merchandise margin decline incremental markdowns taken to manage inventories and category mix were offset by better markdown management and initial markups we also sort inventory reserves to account for aged goods as we align our inventory process during ebuys integration total company occupancy expenses as a percentage of sales remain flat primarily due to favorable real estate taxes we continue to manage expenses through organizational efficiencies at our home office and store labor and as a result operating expense as a percentage of sales improved  basis points during the quarter with tighter discipline on discretionary spending we will continue to identify cost savings while investing in key priorities in the medium term we recorded a net loss from equity investment in town shoes of  million this quarter the unseasonal conditions in canada and the challenging environment resulted in softer sales and higher market downs this quarter similar to dsw we invested a new talent that strengths the merchandising leadership at town shoes as we prepare for the ownership transition next year town will open only  new dsw canada locations in  adjusted net income was  million resulting in an adjusted eps of  per share turning to the balance sheet excluding inventories from ebuys and gordmans inventories on a per square foot basis declined by  we ended the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents including  million year marks for the eventual acquisition of town shoes we allocated  million in capex spending for the quarter and project  million for the full year our lowest level of capital spending in the last  years with our focus on integrating our information data and digital capabilities for tomorrows retail experience technology will account for the largest share of our capex budget this year given the customers rapid adoption of our digital infrastructure today transforming our associate selling platform and partnership with industry leader infor is one of dsws strategic priorities and as such we planned for higher technology spending and technology related depreciation over the next few years as we open fewer new locations and undertake less free model and relocation projects store related capex is expected to decline by a third from last years level lastly id like to provide some color on our full year outlook as we shared with you last quarter fy is expected to calendarize differently than the past few years with earnings weighted more closely to a  split between the front half and the back half of the year the front half is challenged by the website redesign extra expense and minor sales disruption caused by ebuys fulfillment center transition the additional clearance rotation and gordmans liquidation on the other hand the back half will benefit from the rd week progressive results from our power store and key item initiatives in a more impactful contribution from our kids rollout during the backtoschool season we are maintaining our guidance for adjusted earnings per share of  to  this assumes comp at a low end of our prior range due to category mix and inventory management actions gross margin is expected to be lower than last year as we focused on driving sales and gross margin dollars on the expense front we continue to relentlessly review our sga spend with a greater discipline on discretionary and variable expenses while leveraging our scale across all of our businesses we now project a lowsingle digit expense growth for the year with that let me turn the call over to debbie for an update on merchandising debbie ferree thanks jared and good morning everyone were working hard to manage the business in a tough environment we made several categories distortions this spring some of which performed well and some that required a necessary cross correction during the season starting with athletic we drove continued strength in atleisure business with the addition of casual sports style our athletic inspired footwear is now closed to a third of our business we capitalized on a wider range of athletic inspired choices that drove strong comp growth on top of last years challenging comparisons although we have been able to continue to impact the category mix our merchandise margin this quarter we expect the growth of this category to produce a modest margin headwind for the balance of the year in our seasonal category we planned womens sandals for a doubledigit decline at the start of the season and performance has been stronger than planned in hindsight we positioned this category too conservatively and weve now moved into chase mode with the bulk of a sandal season still ahead of us were bringing in additional receipts as we head into the peak selling season other category distortion had mixed results we’ve received encouraging results in openup styles but found the closeup dress styles are not resonating with the customers we are evaluating ways to tactically drive growth in this category by focusing on top dress locations where demand is more constant on the other hand we’re encouraged with the customer response to our fashion casual assortments particularly with new silhouettes knocked downs and her existing wardrobe today the results from our women’s category illustrate the need to continue to take calculated risks and operate at a greater agility than ever before with the industry providing more freshness jim and his team will position dsw to take full advantage of these opportunities to bring sustainable growth into our women’s business we must achieve positive comps in women’s to drive the business and this is our top priority similar to the women’s category men’s dress was soft due to continued shift towards the casual and athletic styles and late receipts from a key vendor we are adjusting receipts and significantly editing our assortment to support the most productive items within them in accessories the trend was unchanged from the fourth quarter even the customers selective purchasing behavior in accessories were rationalizing choice count to focus on fewer must have items i look forward to the first perspective that nancy and her team will bring to the accessory business we successfully installed dsw kids at  locations this quarter which now bring kids to close to  of our locations after applying our learning from last year these warehouses have produced greater incremental sales than the first phase we are optimistic our customers will find a compelling kids offering during the important backtoschool selling period in addition to jim and nancy we’ve also made a number of key hires within planning and allocation this quarter and i am exciting with the diversity and expertise and experience we now have across the entire buying planning and allocating organizations as we elevate talent and build one of the strongest teams in the industry we will raise our gains we will continue to develop great products and great customer experiences that was established designer shoe warehouse at the premium destination for footwear with that let me turn the call over to roger roger rawlins thanks debbie big ticket items personal technology and rising cost of healthcare have created headwinds from discretionary spending and made the customer more demand of value to compete in this environment we must remain focused on building great products and great customer experiences that differentiate designer shoe warehouse recent recognition from the harris poll and conde nasts  love list illustrates the strong brand equity that designer shoe warehouse has built particularly among millennial we must continue working hard to earn the right remain top of mind and grow our share of wallet when we have the right products in the right place we earn our customers dollars the assortment initiatives we started last fall has begun to improve assortment consistency on the floor with key items penetration now doubled from last year’s levels and tracking toward our targets we’ve also made a number of merchandising process management and talent changes across our power stores that have started to produce better customer service more relevant content and stronger merchandising stories for example we debuted a made in italy collection in a number of our fashion doors and customers have been quite excited by these findings additionally store level marketing plans will begin later in the year aiming to reengage customers in these markets and drum up excitement for the changes we’ve made we expect to sustain and grow these improvements into the balance of the year our efforts to differentiate our merchandise have produced the number of exciting new brands and exclusive opportunities we have secured the exclusive right to sale differentiated content from adidas ahead of other retailers across the country we will start to offer our first collection of underarmor adults and kids footwear during the backtoschool season and finally we debuted the new exclusive collection this quarter with a broad digital marketing campaign and we have been pleased with higher search conversion and sell through rates post launch we are also making progress towards our efforts to redefine dsws warehouse experience were testing a new layout that creates significant additional capacity that allows us to hold more customer choices in every location we are also strengthening our visual merchandising in a way that presents product stories as powerfully in every warehouse as we do online this new layout enables us to reclaim  of our existing cubic capacity for future market share opportunities and increased capacity also gives us more flexibility to optimize dsws existing locations and footprint in conclusion despite the challenging environment dsw will be one of the few survivors of this retail consolidation in a sea of sameness we are singularly focused on creating great product and innovating new experiences that will nurture deeper more meaningful relationships with our customer and inspire her to express herself through fashion i look forward to reporting our progress next quarter with that let me turn the call over to the operator for our qa questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from jeff van sinderen of b riley please go ahead jeff van sinderen i wondered if you can  i know youve talked about athleisure being strong but i wondered if you can give us any sense there of directional changes youre seeing in athletic outside of athleisure maybe how youre planning that business for second half in terms of inventory and also if you could update us on kind of the kids business will evolve for backtoschool this year versus last year debbie ferree yes good morning its debbie thanks for your question so i would tell you in athletic the results indicate a continued strong demand and continued growth in atleisure and when i say atleisure i mean both performance athletics and fashion athletic on the womens and the mens side that are not performance brand so the momentum continues and we continue to fuel that business based on customer demand some of the things that are helping us here are the strength of the key items that we have from our core brand some new exclusive and differentiated products and some new launches which we shared with you on the call so we see this demand continuing through second quarter and even beyond i havent seen this slowdown at all and when you think about it its really in our wheel house the whole athletic atleisure sport piece of the business thats in the nonathletic brand so we feel very comfortable that were growing both the athletic piece of the business and also the womens piece of the business jeff van sinderen okay good to hear and then as a quick follow up can you update us on your latest thinking on real estate maybe if thats your thing at all in your mind i guess which market and store size that you are leaning towards going forward and what is related thinking on what right number of dsw stores is and then maybe just give us a sense remind i guess of how many leases you guys have coming up for renewal over the next couple of years if you decided to wanted to flex roger rawlins i think jeff this is roger as we’ve said on the call the work were doing with our one store i would call it the prototype of what we think the future store looks like frankly is going to have a significant impact on what our future real estate strategy looks like so i think as we’re working through that and understanding how we can increase capacity getting more units in front of the customer and perhaps with a smaller box those are things we’re trying to solve what i would tell you though that we are very passionate about is having our warehouses as close to the customers we possibly we can and today we said this before but we’re within  minutes of  of us population and i think we would want to stay in that kind of ballpark so the number longterm could change the size of them could change that’s all stuff we’re working on to try and solve right now jared poff we have an average of about fiveyear terms when we renew our term so on average roughly we got about  thats coming up for renewal every year operator the next question comes from tom nikic of wells fargo please go ahead tom nikic i wanted to just ask about the comp i think you said traffic was up low single  or transactions and traffic were up lowsingles and that the comp decline was driven by ticket size was that just a function of the extra clearance rotation in the quarter or was there something else going on there jared poff this is jared what we said was that transactions were up so the lowsingle digit across the segment which includes com demand as well as store generated demand transactions were up and ads was down both aur as well as upt so we saw the impact of the rotation by all means but overall i would say mix continues to be a part of what we see and it really was just a function of the selling tom nikic and just for the full year i think you said lowend of your prior range which would suggest down lowsingle should we kind of assume basically sale into back to positive in the q or q jared poff what i would say is right now we are looking at the comps progressively getting better as the year goes on so without giving quarterly guidance what we feel comfortable with is for the full year saying that were going to be at the lower end of the original guidance below down lowsingle digits but again we do expect progressively better performance throughout the year roger rawlins especially given tom that if you look at our performance last year and the back half was significantly worse than the front half so that’s what i would say operator the question comes from david mann of johnson rice please go ahead david mann in terms of the website redesign it sounds like you had some success on the conversion side but youre also calling out some i guess impact in the first half so can you just talk a little bit about the performance from those site sales wise was there any negative impact and how you expect that proceed throughout the year roger rawlins thanks for the question david this is roger i think im excited we are very excited about the results we seen along conversion and that was the reason we went through the site redesign was that we made it mobile first and unfortunately weve really have not done anything i would say for the funding of the sites in the last  years in a meaningful way and so a lot of the seo connections that are exists for  years you lose those when we went through this process so traffic was softer but that was something we knew was going to happen but i think overall im very very excited about the results weve gotten through conversion really has been the big change and we keep talking about this but we love the fact that there is a significant number of our customers who visit our website and now the majority of them are visiting on a mobile device and for them to have it consistent experience from what they see on that device to what they see when they walk in the store we think this site redesign gives us that kind of capability and thats the direction well headed david mann and then jared in terms of guidance here your gross margin guidance i think is a tad weaker than you talked about on the last call can you just talk about the puts and takes as we should look at them over the rest of the year jared poff sure so from a margin standpoint weve got markdown favorability that were anticipating again sequential improvements throughout the balance of the year thats driven by our key items continued key item traction on the power  traction which roger talked to you and were very excited about in atleisure in general tends to be a little bit of a markdown performer thats better than the balance of the chain and we do still see headwinds coming from shipping as that continues to be directtoconsumer a piece of fulfillment that grows although the headwind we do expect to become less of a headwind but a headwind nonetheless as the year progresses and ebuys as weve talked about before theyve got a transition to their new distribution center taking from  it already started a little bit in the first quarter but going through the third quarter and we expect that to also provide some headwinds on the margin side david mann and then on ebuys i think youve talked in the past that the longterm opportunity maybe to clear goods through there rather than the way you have in the past this effort that you did this past quarter to liquidate merchandise did that give you any sense or snapshot on how much better margin could be through liquidation for ebuys versus through the stores as youve done that jared poff sure what i will tell you is weve run some very manual events where we have actually taken some of our deepest discounted products from the stores that are around the distribution centers at ebuys and send them to ebuys to list and sell we were very very pleased with the results that we saw with them selling on their marketplaces versus having that visible only to people that were walking through those specific dsw stores and we think there is a very big unlock there this new distribution center helps set the stage for that with the additional investments were making in the technology that we talked about down the road thats going to further enable us to be able to do that seamlessly so were not having to actually shuttle the merchandise from the stores over the ebuys multiple speakers roger rawlins sorry this is roger i think the big things for us in q was the work that our team did to transition from what is really four different fulfillment center that were dispersed throughout the united states supporting ebuys into one location in nashville so we haven’t really turned on a lot of the capabilities that we think we can bring the life with ebuys because we had disconnects on facility so i think we’re now positioned were primarily in the back half we think there will be some opportunity to go in a different direction with the assortment i think the other challenge that we have i shouldn’t say challenge the thing we have to look at is as we started to make those goods available we also have to make certain we’re not feeding too much because that business was not built around having access to the number of units that are available within a dsw so again we can make certainly have the right infrastructure that can handle that volume too so those are all things that’s why we’re moving to the pace to make certain that it is successful longterm and doesn’t damage our relationships in the marketplace david mann very helpful one last housekeeping question jared in the guidance you gave last quarter you talked about how the gordmans liquidation might impact you given that stage is taking  plus stores and looks like they’re going to operate them throughout the rest of the year can you give us a sense and an update of what’s in your guidance for the gordmans impact jared poff what i would say is we were very happy with the progress that we’ve made through the liquidation and then obviously finding a transition agreement with stage and that transition agreement is one of that bleeds down overtime so they have their own footwear business and will ramp up as a course of the year progresses and as we ramp down but it is something that we’ll continued for a little bit to get this year so overall i think we’ve managed our exposure to the gordmans gob very very well all that being said obviously still one is would something that was a drag for last year versus last year and we have taken a fair amount of activity and moved product from gordmans stores to nearby dsws on occasion we’ve taken it from the gordmans fulfillment center and moved it ebuys we kind of maneuvered it all throughout the organization and actually have been very  it makes it very challenging to pinpoint what its specific overall impact is just related to that so netnet we’re very comfortable with our full year guidance of  to  but i’m not really able to breakout the exact impact of every piece of the gordmans liquidation operator the next question comes from chris svezia of wedbush please go ahead chris svezia first question i guess just on the comp going to the lower end of your range for the gear i was just wondering is it a function of  because you commented in april you turned positive i mean you don’t have given any indication of where you are right now but is it a function of the fact you don’t have enough sandal inventory you’re chasing that product and maybe some errors in women’s dress business that are causing maybe more conservative comp view in the near to mediumterm or is it just the fact that q sells below  down  was probably below where you expected so therefore you’re resetting now i’m just of curious about how you think about those all conditions debbie ferree good morning chris this is debbie thanks for your question so just as i address sandal sandal planned in a doubledigit comp drop for the season but the reason that was is because of the strength continuing strength of the athletic and nonathletic sport business so its really more of a balancing act to come out here to your total comp but the sandal inventory that we have right now thats selling through much faster than we expected were pulling upper receipts for buying more receipts and we expect to have a solid performance in the sandal category for both q and actually into q you remember last year we ran out of that product and we did not fund our hot stores at warm doors way that we should have as far as dress shoes are concerned were right sizing that inventory and that was where some of the biggest comp pressure happens but there are pieces within that category that are actually doing very well while we openedup product is doing very well closedup category is not and so were actually taking the markdown to make sure we transition in a clean way into the third quarter there so does that answers your question chris svezia so basically just in a nutshell the first quarter comp decline of  might have been a little bit lower than what you expected and therefore youre slightly adjusting a year to be a little bit lower versus we dont have enough sandal inventory to kind a chase the business drive the comp and dress sort of is underperforming is this issue today debbie ferree yes and i think what you will see is based on the adjustments that we made both in the dress inventory and the acceleration of sandal receipts youre going to see sequential improvement throughout second and third quarter relative to what you saw in q chris svezia okay thank you roger just a question for you when i think about town and town shoes that integration process and i don’t know if you could just tap or color about this but it seems like according to  it generates roughly  million in revenue youve lost some money in the first quarter when you fully integrate this business and it flows through the pl kind of walk us through what youre going to do to improve the profitability of this segment so that it doesnt  so that’s not dilutive for the full company for dsw once its integrating next year roger rawlins chris thanks and also thanks for the question on town because were excited about what the potential looks like there what i will tell you is were going to get back to everyone later this year with a pure game plan of what were doing so im really dont want to get into the specifics as we sit here today but what i will tell you is that we have franchised our dsw brand up in canada and were excited to really start to manage that brand on our own and we think there are obviously significant synergies as we manage the dsw brand alone with town and other businesses i do think that town brand itself provides some differentiation for dsw inc because that gives debbie access to brands and goods that perhaps might not be available today at the dsw so were thinking through how can we use all of those brands to impact our relationships with our vendor partners and ultimately grow both top and bottom line chris svezia okay thank you and all the best operator the next question comes from steve marotta of cl king  associates please go ahead steve marotta jared can you please comment on the composition of the current inventory and clearance activities thats expected in the second quarter jared poff i guess from a markdown perspective again without giving quarterly specific guidance we are expecting to see our markdown performance improve versus last year on a  sequentially better as the year goes on so again we saw some markdown unfavourability this year primarily related to our clearance rotations we see that headwind still probably some headwind into the second quarter but not nearly to the same extent and progressively getting better as the year goes on steve marotta okay deborah did you say that athletic is a third of the total women selection debbie ferree yes so it would be the performance athletic which is the true athletic brand plus the fashion women’s and men’s brands that don’t fit in athletic space so we call that atleisure because the customer demand in sneakers that could reside either in the performance piece of could reside in the fashion sport piece so that is the sum total of both athletic and fashion nonathletic steve marotta great and if the women’s and men’s comp was given i apologize i missed it could you offer that please for the quarter debbie ferree we’re not giving specific our comp numbers at the department level anymore operator the next question comes from camilo lyon of canaccord genuity please go ahead camilo lyon roger i was hoping you could maybe help disaggregate the difference between the stores that are seeing positive store traffic and the one that are seeing negative traffic and what are you doing in those stores that are giving that positive traffic specifically and what i’m really getting at here is how much selfhelp opportunity do you have in front of you to really turn a change traffic positive roger rawlins one thing i will tell you is in all of retail getting positive traffic into a brick and mortar location i think is very few people i think that are accomplished in that i think where we are having success is leveraging the  million rewards members that we know and engaging them in a unique and different way and to me that is the opportunity that we have and i’m proud of our marketing team our traffic i think significantly beat what we get from a competitive landscape standpoint and again using that rewards information to really drive our business is an important part i also think our field organization and michele being here now is going to help this we’ve got to do a better job of capturing data on those rewards members it’s great that we have  million reward members but we need to have  million addresses as well as an email addresses and that works that we’re doing and we’ve talk about our technology will rolling out here in the next  months with the support of infor that’s why we’re going down that so that we can have technology that’s in the store so our associates instead of having  devices would have  device instead of having  logins we’ll have  login to be able to engage a consumer in a way that frankly we could not do today so our path to getting i would say traffic improvements will come through the hardware of our field organization the support of our marketing team but then ultimately i think be driven by the technology we’re rolling out that will make it easy for our associates to engage the customer and for the customer to provide us that information camilo lyon thank you for that if i could switch topic here for a quick second jared on ebuys could you help me understand help us understand how much of a contribution in the first quarter came from the liquidation im trying to parse out the true organic growth of ebuys versus what seems to be more ephemeral in nature jared poff the liquidation i guess im not following what liquidation are you referring to camilo lyon the gordmans liquidation that you ran through ebuys jared poff yes again its very challenging to break that out when you look at there were store specific movements made and various things within distribution centers and their fulfillment center going to process through ebuys and going to some of this dsw so when we look at the overall and if its very muddy and to give you a number with specificity i think would just be a guess overall like i said we were very happy with the results again in that situation and i think our team managed the overall exposure as best they could camilo lyon okay so but it is safe to say that  growth is not the right number to be thinking about for that channel jared poff for the ebuys camilo lyon yes jared poff yes i mean on a go forward basis i think that would be a pretty aggressive growth target overall from a sustainability standpoint yes camilo lyon okay thanks my last question debbie for you is youve had a fair amount of turnover in your gmms and womens sounds like you said has been under pressure for quite some time as you step back and think about the business think about your place in it you think about the demands that are now being placed on vendors to be quicker to market and quicker to you with inventory as you also try to manage your inventory more tightly what do you think you need more of or what do you think really gets the womens business to turn positive for you debbie ferree well thats a great question and i wish i have the couple of hours to sit and to talk to you about this but ill try to keep it brief number one speedtomarket is critical and were trying to work with all of our vendors to try to make sure that they increase their speed not only in terms of new product to market but in the timing as they get it to enter the market and into the customers hands and i think our industry needs to improve in that substantially i think that when you think about talent and the kinds of talent that we need  were always looking for great talent and the kind of talent that you need today to really run a business that is been where the customer is really changing their expectations what they want how quickly they want it i think when you took a look at our talent in the organization we found that there was opportunity to elevate some talent that was in the organization to bring this strategy to life in a quick way and to work with the vendor partners even a little bit more closely than we have and to also hold our team in dsw accountable which i think we can do a much much better job of that so the talent changed changes that weve made we promoted from internal talent jim was an internal promote and weve gotten some talent from the outside nancy was from the outside and i think this blend of diversification of talent to bring us to a more elite team is going to demonstrate results that were going to be very pleased with going forward in the future camilo lyon can new vendors accommodate the speed to market it seems like there is only one vendor in the market steve madden that can do that well debbie ferree yes hes pretty good at it actually hes fantastic at it but there are many brands that were working with much much more closely and trying to understand their supply chain process and how we can work with them either on material or doing more testing earlier testing faster testing speedtomarket testing moving test items to bigger items and there are actually a handful of them that are doing very nicely for us no question that madden at it actually the best at it but he’s kind of provided the gold standard by which we’re holding many of the other vendors accountable so i think you’re going to see some significant changes that will result in some positive results going forward operator the next question comes from scott krasik of buckingham research please go ahead scott krasik two first one on guidance and then sort of a bigger picture question jared just wondering it seems like investors after q didn’t sort of understand the puts and takes of the quarter i’m just wondering how close we should model this  split in terms of the first half and second half eps guidance to your comment jared poff again we don’t give quarterly guidance but with the  split you can probably back into q pretty well i think we feel pretty good about that’s what so that’s one to support the  to  and given the puts and takes that i walk through we feel pretty good about the  split scott krasik okay and then debbie  thanks and then debbie as you look at the back half of the year we’ve heard that there’s already a lot of casual booties out in the marketplace that maybe the department stores were packing away product last year and it’s obviously a potentially high margin big category for you in the back half of the year so i’m just wondering how you sort of expect to drive better comp performance in the back half of the year boots appear to be challenging debbie ferree sure so obviously athletic continues and like i said i’m very comfortable with the kind of demand customer demand that we are seeing that i just believe continues kid’s growth continues as you know we just started another tranche of stores in march and so we have that going for us as well on the other category that we are starting to see some really nice results and specifically in the women’s casual category and there’s many things that are working there right now continue flat sport work and then in sandals last year i remember us talking to you about third quarter really running out of casual sandals because it’s still very very hot and not really having protected our zone  which is our warmest zone in the country the way that we should have so i think there’s an opportunity there boots we are going to be planning very conservatively the same categories that worked last year are not working this year but will not be working with this year because i think that they have kind of seen their end of life but there is some excitement that is happening in the boot category and the categories within boots that we plan to drive should actually get us some higher auts than we’ve got last year so it’s going to be a balancing act but i think that there is enough positive going on with some new trends and continuing trends that it makes me confident in our back half roger rawlins scott the other piece of the back half that we think will have a significant impact are our power stores and the assortment changes that we have made in those stores where we’ve increased the penetration significantly of better and best brands and i think that  those stores are a material portion of our top and bottom line and the changes weve made there those stores have been gapped anywhere from  to  basis points below balance of chain and as weve closed that gap and we look for the balance of year to actually have that gap to go the other way so we believe in the power doors to be able to drive the comp as well operator the next question comes from patrick mckeever of mkm partners please go ahead patrick mckeever question on the enhancements that youve made to the website the redesign and then the relaunch what were some of the specific things that youve did that are driving the big increase in conversion and then i was wondering if you could run through some of the numbers again that you mentioned earlier i think you said digital demand was up in the highteens but not sure and then my second question is just on all the store closures across the department store space and also on the footwear space the liquidation sales likely in the second and third quarters and then probably a lot of closed stores going into the fourth and into next year my question is how are you thinking about the industry rationalization and how does it play into the guidance through this year for both sales and also gross margin roger rawlins patrick this is roger i think the first i will tell you the biggest change that weve made was going through responsive design and the vast majority of the conversion improvement we are seeing is through the mobile device and its material and when you think about it again our site was designed  years ago when the phone i had was a flip phone that wasnt really set up to allow me to do commerce on a device and i think that kind of change thats where were seeing the vast majority of our improvement is on the mobile device jared you want to talk about the other jared poff sure yeah what we had mentioned is that the digital demand as a portion of our overall segment demand had increased in the highteens and our  the amount of sales that were digitally demanded but fulfilled from a store was in just shy of  so  i think it was closer to  so at the end from an omni multichannel standpoint as roger talked about for a quite a while now we are looking to focus on driving digital demand and fulfilling it from the place that makes the most sense anywhere in the chain and weve built the infrastructure to do that and its playing out that way roger rawlins and again when you connect that with what weve talked about on the call the experience were creating in and a store where there is  roughly more choices available to a consumer and within  minutes of that consumer it will create a what we believe is a competitive advantage to be able to get those goods quicker to a consumer than our competition and offer them a broader assortment in a local market than they can see anywhere else patrick mckeever and then just a quick follow up to that and just digital demand up in the highteens whats the comparable figure for that did you say back in the fourth quarter that  did you say at the midteens at that point in time so would that be the acceleration from midtohigh teens roger rawlins i think thats yes thats right and that was impacted negatively in q and also we’ll continue throughout the spring season because of the loss of some of the sco traffic that you would have naturally have received so again we’re very excited about the changes we’ve made in the customers response to it and not just tough but also on our mobile apps and i’m probably not to say this but we’re launching a droid app this week as well so actually our it person is probably going to shoot me for saying that but we’ve got to be much more aggressive in our customer facing applications and things we’re doing and i think the changes we’ve made on the site are the right changes and it’s where we are headed patrick mckeever and then on the rationalization roger rawlins on just department store is that  patrick mckeever exactly just how that plays into guidance jared poff what i would tell you is we think that the closer of doors in department store space and the gordmans space and the payless space and you name it the footwear space is consolidating we are looking at capturing a market share in this consolidated environment through whatever channels make the most sense we have reached out and a targeted campaign towards make these customers and other stores that are closing and what we have found is on a lot of them already what rewards members and so it’s making sure that we let them know and that wed love to continue to service whatever footwear needs that were having met by these department stores we are not necessarily building into guidance anything specific related to  doors closing in this market but overall our goal of driving market share gain is something we’re absolutely focused on and we think as this market consolidate we are going to be the best beneficiary of that operator the next question comes from jay sole of morgan stanley please go ahead jay sole great thank you roger at top of your comments you mentioned obviously there is a challenge going on but also you slightly highlighted some factors that are pressuring the consumer i think you mentioned rising healthcare costs and bigticket items can you talk about what factor is more important right now and maybe what’s the figure driver of the changes that are happening in footwear overall roger rawlins jay i think as we’ve been looking things the data point that i would refer you to is there was a  i think  i forgot what it was but it was well someone had issued a report that said our sector meaning footwear apparel that over the past  years our area had been hit harder than any one meeting we had lost the largest share of wallet of the consumer and what we are seeing and i think it was consistent with what was in that report was that it’s about healthcare it’s about education and it’s about services so as were thinking how can we address opportunities that provide services related to footwear for those are things that we believe we can add and we have the right to add to our consumer base that’s something they would value from us and then connecting that through our rewards program and engaging again and in experience that is unique when they visit one of our warehouses those are things we think we can bring to life that will counter some of the declines that have taken place in our entire retail sector operator the next question comes from sam poser of susquehanna please go ahead sam poser i just wondered if you could give us the idea of sort of  without giving specifics what percent of your business is touched by digital it doesnt mean youre buying it online but i mean how many people are accessing and coming in to the stores or buying online i mean just how much is just touched by digital right now versus lets say couple of years ago roger rawlins yeah sam its a great question i think its just a between  and  of all of our customers as being engaged with our brand that engagement starts in a digital way first and when you think about the impact of that and stuff were doing can ultimately have on the experience with the customer that is a significant impact and what we are working toward is when they are on that device and theyre looking at the device and they see like right now the top  trends in the spring season and then they walk into a dsw warehouse and they do not see those trends stand out when they walk in you suddenly created a disconnect with your customers so weve got to figure out ways through how we market how we present how we talk to the consumer to make that experience consistent between the mobile device between their desktop and between them walking into the warehouse and thats work were doing and again we have a lab store that were working through that were really excited about how we can change that experience because we think if you dont do that then you are not a digital business and yeah its great were using our warehouse to fulfill demands but thats price of entry we got to figure out how we develop and build experiences that are unique and differentiated and start with that i would say digital mindset or just put the customer first and if we do that were going to were going to win sam poser thank you and then i guess the question i know youve talked over the years about your rewards your rewards both being  of your business your comps does not then  they havent been great over the last few years i mean what can you do  at  what can you do to bring that up because its  youre getting new people but are they all coming to the party as much as you would like i guess is the question and how do you get more productivity out of them to start driving improved samestore sales roger rawlins the same i would say i think the first things starts with getting our womens products right and as debbie mentioned when i told you this before when we met weve made visits to our warehouses as a team and we were not satisfied with what we were presenting to the consumers so its starts and frankly ends right there weve got to get the right product in the right place on the womens side and when that happens then im very comfortable that the traffic we are getting they are coming to us unfortunately theyre not liking what they were seeing at as a greater they had the year before and that is about product and thats the talent that debbie has addressed so i would say thats the big driver for us sam poser but one last thing is that product or is that the experience or is it that combination because you mentioned youve started off the discussion on experience is that what is the line i guess roger rawlins it starts with product first and then experience second thats what i would tell you and i think what weve seen in our power doors where we have addressed the product were very excited with the results we have seen and we have not addressed anything i would say around experience yet in those stores and that would be next but it’s a very clear based on the results we’ve seen in those doors where debbie and team have done exactly what we need to do to balance the company that when we had the right products she will buy it sam poser well thank you very much good luck roger rawlins you’re welcome thanks operator this concludes the questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to roger rawlins for any closing remarks roger rawlins first of all just like to say thanks to everybody for calling in and again to our associates on the call keep up the great work and we are making incredible progress so thanks everybody operator the conference is now concluded

find people webmail menu … … april   alumnus ceo roger rawlins shares his insights with fisher students share sharing the same insights with fisher students as he did with wall street investors just a week prior roger rawlins returned to his alma mater to provide students with a look at the past present and a vision for the future of his company dsw inc named ceo in november rawlins bsba ’ emba ’ has worked to implement key strategies and priorities to turn the columbusbased shoe retailer around he emphasized the importance of generating buyin among employees and leaders for change initiatives “as you go out into the workforce i can’t encourage you enough to be a part of the group that embraces change and big ideas be a part of it” he said “demonstrating a level of enthusiasm and acceptance of change will help you stand out in what can be a crowded world to your leadership team” dean anil makhija introduces roger rawlins ceo of dsw inc and a fisher college of business alumnus rawlins detailed key milestones in dsw’s growth since its founding in  among them the launch of the “reward your style” membership program and its website and a focus on omnichannel marketing and consumer outreach he also outlined his three areas of focus to help dsw better compete in the crowded shoe market focus tempo and disruption “we’ve lost focus on the product and how we market the product” rawlins said “tools and technologies will never be the driver of our business  it’s about the shoes and in particular women’s shoes  we have to embrace change and leverage the enthusiasm for change to try new things “finally we’re building on our legacy of disruption we were one of if not the first footwear retailer to offer an opensell environment create a rewards program and provide an assortment of footwear unmatched in the marketplace we are getting back to creating dsw’s disruptive capabilities” for undergraduate student hannah cedargren the opportunity to hear from a leader of a recognized brand learn about his vision for the company and how he plans to execute it was invaluable “roger provided retail industry insights that you can’t learn from a book” she said “when i think of shoes i would never think of amazon so to learn they are the market leader was surprising to me i found it especially interesting that dsw’s plan to turn the company around was to not only sell shoes but shoes with an experience i have a feeling that selling experiences is the direction that the brickandmortar retailers are headed to avoid losing business to companies like amazon” that rawlins was a twotime fisher grad willing to return to campus and engage with current students made the experience even more impactful to mba student catherine banton opportunities like this one really bring my fisher education to life she said this isnt a vacuum where you develop a skill set without learning from the outside world being in a city like columbus where you have these incredible and diverse companies is extremely valuable the fact that the ceo of dsw is an alum and willing to share with us what from his mba experience helped him be successful is motivating and inspiring share more on these topics students  programs alumni  friends  fisher college of business  neil avenue columbus ohio  privacy policy accessibility technology library resources feedback faculty  staff login
