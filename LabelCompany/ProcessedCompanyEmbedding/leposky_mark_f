technology where the supply chain meets the value chain january    robert maloneno tags available by taking a different approach to the way we look at certain objects and processes we gain the benefit of objectivity a similar method holds true when looking at the supply chain it is the nature of systems especially complex ones such as in the supply chain to evolve and change part of the pressure on this evolution has been the movement of erp companies into supply chain management erp providers and their solutions have generally entertained a financial bias or perspective its little wonder then that erp pressure has led companies to reexamine the very nature of their supply chains both as a business and as a source of financial control the world of justintime is being transformed into a world of just making the quarterly plan—from where are the goods to where is the money it constitutes a major change one company that has had a profound impact on the supply chain in recent years is dallas texasbased i part of is impact is a result of its fresh look at the supply chain and the processes and values it encompasses keeping it in perspective in terms of its scm solution i differentiates value chain management from transportation management and distribution management according to razat gaurav senior manager of product marketing and strategy i supply chain management enables enterprises to forecast demand match supply with demand and execute to fulfill that demand—including transportation and distribution processes—keeping realworld material and capacity constraints in perspective he explains traditional supply chain management has focused on these processes from an enterprisecentric perspective is value chain management solution however goes beyond the four walls of the enterprise and drives collaborative planning execution and event management of business processes with channels suppliers logistics and other trading partners value chain management also encompasses a broader perspective and embraces all business processes from the supplier to the customers customer these processes include supplier relationship management supply chain management and demand chain management gaurav says value chain management is predicated on driving benefits for the entire supply chain he notes it is based on the notion that the basis for competition has shifted from enterprise vs enterprise to value chain vs value chain focus on the customer i has recently increased its focus on the customer with solutions designed to create operational efficiencies that enhance shareholder value and improve customer service levels these offerings include an endtoend distributed order execution solution which provides a single face to the customer across a heterogeneous environment intelligent demand planning replenishment planning and order fulfillment and optimal transportation and distribution management the i scm solution

leposky vice president of global operations taylormadeadidas golf we expect to also benefit from improvements in product sellthrough information velocity driving more effective use of is demand planning and forecasting solutions which are already deployed he adds cis architecture gaurav believes that is technology architecture also gives it an advantage over its competitors is common infrastructure services cis is an open standards integration architecture drawing upon bestofbreed tools from leaders such as informatica and web methods he says i also has gained knowledge and experience from more than  implementations across  customers the architecture drives rapid and seamless integration of i solutions in diverse heterogeneous environments that characterize most enterprises today part of the value that i brings to the table is its integrated approach to meshing optimization technologies with industry bestpractice experience notes gaurav this combination
