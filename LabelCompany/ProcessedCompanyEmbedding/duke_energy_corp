ava trades from  read morehide full article duke energy corporation duk  free report has decided to recycle coal ash stored at the h f lee plant in goldsboro nc for use in concrete productsdetails of the decisionduke energy plans to reprocess a major portion of the  million tons of coal ash stored at the site into concrete products by  residue generated during the recycling process will be transferred to a safe and permanent offsite storage as duke energy is not currently planning to construct an onsite landfill for storagenote that this decision is in line with duke energy’s undertaken initiative to store coal ash in dry landfills and the company is currently working on safe management of the ash stored in the basins until they are permanently closedin  duke energy had reprocessed nearly two thirds of the ash produced across its service territories in oct  the company announced plans to recycle coal ash from the buck steam station in salisburynorth carolinas coal ash law calls for intensive recycling of the byproduct thereby necessitating duke energy to locate a total of three sites across the state for reprocessing the same as these three plants begin operating the company would be able to process over  tons of coal ash annually note that the company has to declare the locations for two more coal ash recycling plants by jan  duke energy has been striving for the safe closure of all its coal ash basins in a bid to protect and conserve the environment in doing so it has safely excavated nearly  million tons of coal ash across the north and south carolinas so farrationale of the announcementcoal ash is a nonhazardous byproduct generated during the combustion of coal for electricity production since coal ash has high carbon content it is unsuitable for use in the manufacturing of concrete products however duke energy is investing in technology that can convert the highcarbon content coal ash into concrete productsinterestingly coal ash is used for manufacturing over half the total concrete production in the us based on its ability to make roads bridges and buildings stronger and more durable moreover the use of coal ash in concrete manufacturing is safer for the environment given that every ton of coal ash that replaces portland cement in concrete nearly  ton of greenhouse gas emissions is displacedprice movementshares of duke
