dots and the environment our quantum dot synthesis is the “greenest” or most environmentallyfriendly process due to its use of ordinary commercial surfactants typically used in shampoos and laundry detergents as the principal chemical rather than toxic chemicals normally used in batch synthesis processes our automated process provides economies of scale in production of more quantum dots per chemicals used due to economical micromixing during the continuous flow process higher production levels less waste and toxic chemicals are factors that contribute to our ability to claim lcoe –

uncopyable systems cost is the biggest issue and limiting factor for expanding usage of quantum dots in the ink markets the printed electronics industry is a leader in moving on environmental issues the newsprinting industry switched to ecological friendly soy ink years ago it is safe to say there are very few applications that will be filled with heavy metal inks nonheavy metal quantum dot and semiconductor nanocrystals must be developed to meet this requirement and challenge the solution opportunities in the security ink field include brand identification anticounterfeiting track  trace and product authentication although quantum dots are the newcomer to the ink market they bring many advantages their smaller size is better than large qd for meeting inkjet printing requirements and semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots are many times smaller than conductive metals with measurements starting at nm automating the qd manufacturing process and then scaling to large scale production of high quality and performance quantum dots that add value will created new markets for wide distribution and usage volumes the cost of using quantum dots will come by decline by changing a novelty

please tell readers more about quantum materials corp  quantum materials corp “qmc”  otcqb qtmm  is an innovative technology company that is primarily a manufacturer of quantum dots “qds“  we have developed a proprietary ipprotected technology and process to manufacture qds on a highly scalable basis an achievement not common in the industry  a key competitive advantage is the continuousflow production capacity we engineered to allow us to produce premium quality quantum dots for qdenabled lcds “qd lcds”   quantum dots are truly amazing  they’re a thousandtimes smaller than microscopic crystals or nanocrystals which when excited by uv to blue light emit light of different colors depending on the material and size of the nano particle  imagine shining a flashlight on a baseball and it glowing bright red  that’s the general idea of a quantum dot except of course almost inconceivably smaller in size  with our innovative approach we aim to leapfrog traditional batch synthesis nonuniform production platforms  we’re confident we can ship large industrialscale quantities of qds at very competitive prices  samples have been sent to a number of the largest display technology companies in the world  a single commercial purchase order would put qmc on the map  we have recruited some of the most accomplished scientists researchers engineers and production personnel in the material sciences industry  this was a key factor in my decision to join qmc  i think we have an outstanding team especially given our small size how large are the existing markets that you plan to penetrate  what new markets do you envision the most immediate market and the one in which we have most traction is in lcd tvs representing hundreds of millions of units per year  qds can also be used in billboards monitors laptops  tablet devices  each of these segments also represent the potential for hundreds of millions of units annually so these display markets represent by far our biggest focus qmc was founded to drive qd solar energy photovoltaic or qdpv development  we have a whollyowned subsidiary to fulfill the promise that qds hold in expanding pv implementation  a major advantage of qdpv is that established pv cells depend on relatively thick layers of material for adequate light energy absorption  by contrast qdpv devices possess absorption rates ordersofmagnitude higher they can absorb infrared energy at night and on cloudy days  that radically reduces the thickness and therefore the materials required meaningfully cutting manufacturing costs so quantum dot technology moderately enhances the picture quality of lcd tvs and other display monitors at less cost  is there more to the story  that’s a good question  yes there is more to the story especially with regard to solar and a number of other exciting end uses for us though higher quality qds  in much greater quantities and at significantly lower cost is our mantra  our quantum dots will substantially enhance the picture quality of a lcd tv  over time we fully expect our qds to be used in other products we will be wholesaling them to companies spearheading widespread adoption of new end uses  as such we will sidestep the technologically competitive and brand penetration risks of our customers   competition must be fierce including from giants like samsung  how can your company thrive in this environment i get asked that a lot  much of the competition comes from smaller firms like ours trying to disrupt larger players  some have won designs and shipped qds into tv applications  we have patents and valuable ip licenses and our scalable qd manufacturing process is highly automated so we can offer customers both high quality and high capacity that’s not significantly impacted by labor or geography  we see the larger players in the industry as potential customers and partners rather than competitors  most don’t have wellestablished highquality quantum dot technology in house or sufficient manufacturing capacity  large players should be eager to partner with a company like qmc you said large  small public  private companies are already using quantum dots  what can you say about the cost quality and other elements of existing qds  much of the success in the market emanates from companies that have supplied cadmiumbased heavy metal qds  this is important because with restrictions on the use of cadmium in europe and japan the future for those products is not bright  we are not the only game in town but the volumes of products supplied by competitors is still quite small  since we use manufacturing processes that we believe are superior we expect to deliver a better product suite again at a very competitive price  what about technology risk from new methods of producing quantum dots  could your intellectual property become obsolete  we are the new method for making qds we are the ones posing a risk to the incumbent’s ip  our ip is strong and we are always developing new ip to secure and consolidate our position in the market  this is still an emerging science so i expect a lot of developments in the next decade and we’re seeing a lot of research being done at universities as well as at large and small companies  no one knows for sure but the expanding size and wider range of enduses promise a large qd market for the foreseeable future if quantum dot technology has been around for decades why hasn’t the market taken off developing and optimizing the quality of materials and integrating new core technologies such as qds takes time  it’s no different from the original lcd  oled technologies that took decades to develop  no different from lithiumion batteries that are becoming ubiquitous  products from select companies are shipping and there are tvs in the market that utilize qds  however it’s still early days and the market is huge  while we think we have an opportunity to capture substantial market share even more modest penetration could over time amount to hundreds of millions in revenue  not bad for a company with an enterprise value market cap  debt – cash of us million  do you feel that qmc has a finite window of opportunity during which it has to gain traction or risk missing key growth stages in the market  yes each market from tv to solar to innovative uses to ensure the authenticity of pharmaceuticals each have windows of opportunity  we are constantly monitoring these windows to make sure we’re well–positioned and we think we are  however as mentioned display represents the clearest path to revenue generation  solar provides us with longerterm potential potential for which we could possibly selffund based on cash flow from our display segment  i understand that the company has been sending sample material to a number of parties what type of endusers are being targeted  yes that’s right  companies receiving samples are those able to take our qds and produce film composites for use in tvs and other display applications  we are talking about a handful of large wellestablished players in the tv supply chain  this is a critical step for us and we think it demonstrates where we stand in our development phase  small companies like ours are able to sell samples because our customers believe that our technology and our ability to operate at industrialscale is secure  that means the ability to ramp up ifwhen we receive commercialscale purchase orders  and look the companies buying our samples aren’t playing games the display industry is a serious business  there’s lots of money at stake including investment on their part to evaluate our samples and make qdcomposite films to the extent that you believe the valuation of qmc is attractive why should readers consider investing now  why not wait for commercial purchase orders as evidenced by major tv manufacturers beginning to offer qdenhanced model lines qds have arrived but the market is wide open  if we are at a tipping point in qds then waiting for a major derisking event like a purchase order could mean missing out on a large move in the share price  it’s that simple  we’re confident that our team can provide qds of the highest quality in the volumes necessary for wholesale commercial introduction  if we can execute on that premise qmc could be a very interesting company  still there remains considerable risk  we’ve been at this for years but have yet to cross the finish line  that’s the unmistakable riskreward proposition for investors an opportunity which evolves as a company goes from “lab to fab”  we have a great future ahead of us and we’re aiming to create a valuable company for our employees customers and shareholders sri thank you so much for your time and thoughtprovoking answers quantum dots are hard to conceptualize but their functionality and importance in a growing number of end uses is just beginning  i hope this interview serves as
