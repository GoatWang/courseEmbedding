  description of business    a   business development   andes  inc company or the registrant was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on july   and has been inactive since inception on february   following the entry of a the consent in lieu of shareholder meeting and the b resolutions of the board of directors and c resolutions of the board of directors all dated on february   the following events occurred which resulted in a change of control of the company the company redeemed an aggregate of  from its former sole shareholder of the then  shares of outstanding stock held at a redemption price of  per share for an aggregate redemption price of  the former sole shareholder proceeded to resign from his director and officer positions as the sole shareholder at the time and prior to his resignation as the sole director former sole shareholder appointed andrew khor poh kiang to serve as director on the board of directors   the company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition merger exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business andes  inc has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders and filing a registration statement andes  inc has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of     the company registered its common stock on a form  registration statement filed pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the exchange act and rule g thereof the company files with the securities and exchange commission periodic and current reports under rule a of the exchange act including quarterly reports on form q and annual reports form k   to become a publiclytraded company andes  inc may file a registration statement most likely on form s or alternatively that a company first effect a business combination with andes  inc and then subsequently file a registration statement a company may choose to effect a business combination with andes  inc before filing a registration statement   if a target company chooses to enter into business combination with andes  inc the registration statement will be prepared after such business combination the terms of a business combination may provide for redemption of all or part of their stock in andes  inc usually at par   b   business of issuer   based on proposed business activities we are a “blank check” company the sec defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section  a of the exchange act and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies” many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination we intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business     table of contents   the analysis of new business opportunities has and will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the registrant the registrant has considered potential acquisition transactions with several companies but as of this date has not entered into any letter of intent or other agreement with any party the registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets the registrant will consider the following kinds of factors    a potential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products    b competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole    c strength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment    d capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the registrant or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources    e the cost of participation by the registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials    f the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced    g the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items and    h other relevant factors    in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex due to the registrant’s limited capital available for investigation the registrant may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired    a combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and described within the section form of acquisition   once a change of control of andes  inc has been effected if at all new management may issue shares of its stock prior to filing a registration statement for the registration of its shares pursuant to the securities act of  and such shares will be governed by the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission regarding the sale of unregistered securities   form of acquisition   the manner in which the registrant participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the registrant and the promoters of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the registrant and such promoters it is likely that the registrant will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the registrant although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a socalled “tax free” reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity if a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the code all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain  or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity under other circumstances depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties prior stockholders may retain substantially less than  of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity this could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the registrant prior to such reorganization     table of contents   the present stockholders of the registrant will likely not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the registrant following a reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction all or a majority of the registrant’s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders   in the case of an acquisition the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders in the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving us it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares the necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders most likely management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the registrant of the related costs incurred   we presently have no employees our officer and director is engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that he will devote to our business only several hours per week until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been consummated we expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes if any incident to a business combination   item a risk factors   risk factors   an investment in the company is highly speculative in nature and involves an extremely high degree of risk   our business is difficult to evaluate because we have no operating history   as we have no operating history or revenue and only minimal assets there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern and consummate a business combination we have had no recent operating history nor any revenues or earnings from operations since inception we have no significant assets or financial resources we will in all likelihood sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues at least until the consummation of a business combination this may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can consummate a business combination with a profitable business opportunity we cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate a business combination   there is competition for those private companies suitable for a merger transaction of the type contemplated by management   we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities a large number of established and wellfinanced entities including small public companies and venture capital firms are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do consequently we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination these competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination     table of contents   future success is highly dependent on the ability of management to locate and attract a suitable acquisition   the nature of our operations is highly speculative and there is a consequent risk of loss of your investment the success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management of the identified business opportunity while management intends to seek business combinations with entities having established operating histories we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting that criterion in the event we complete a business combination the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control   the company has no existing agreement for a business combination or other transaction   we have no arrangement agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with joint venture with or acquisition of a private or public entity no assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation we cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms and there is consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations   management intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target company which may adversely impact our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate   while seeking a business combination management anticipates devoting no more than a few hours per week to our affairs our officers have not entered into written employment agreements with us and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future this limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination   the time and cost of preparing a private company to become a public reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or acquisition with the most attractive private companies   target companies that fail to comply with sec reporting requirements may delay or preclude acquisition sections  and d of the exchange act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one two or three years depending on the relative size of the acquisition the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition otherwise suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the exchange act are applicable   the company may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations   although we will be subject to the reporting requirements under the exchange act management believes we will not be subject to regulation under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” since we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities if we engage in business combinations which result in our holding passive investment interests in a number of entities we could be subject to regulation under the investment company act if so we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs we have obtained no formal determination from the securities and exchange commission as to our status under the investment company act and consequently violation of the act could subject us to material adverse consequences     table of contents   any potential acquisition or merger with a foreign company may subject us to additional risks   if we enter into a business combination with a foreign concern we will be subject to risks inherent in business operations outside of the united states these risks include for example currency fluctuations regulatory problems punitive tariffs unstable local tax policies trade embargoes risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders and cultural and language differences foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in growth of gross national product rate of inflation market development rate of savings and capital investment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions and in other respects   there is currently no trading market for our common stock   outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered sold pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to or exempt from registration under the securities act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations these restrictions will limit the ability of our stockholders to liquidate their investment     our business will have no revenues unless and until we merge with or acquire an operating business   we are a development stage company and have had no revenues from operations we may not realize any revenues unless and until we successfully merge with or acquire an operating business   the company intends to issue more shares in a merger or acquisition which will result in substantial dilution   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of a maximum of  shares of common stock as amended and a maximum of  shares of preferred stock any merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders moreover the common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or nonarm’slength basis by our management resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders our board of directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval to the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a business combination or otherwise dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially adversely affected   the company has conducted no market research or identification of business opportunities which may affect our ability to identify a business to merge with or acquire   we have neither conducted nor have others made available to us results of market research concerning prospective business opportunities therefore we have no assurances that market demand exists for a merger or acquisition as contemplated by us our management has not identified any specific business combination or other transactions for formal evaluation by us such that it may be expected that any such target business or transaction will present such a level of risk that conventional private or public offerings of securities or conventional bank financing will not be available there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire a business opportunity on terms favorable to us decisions as to which business opportunity to participate in will be unilaterally made by our management which may act without the consent vote or approval of our stockholders     table of contents   because we may seek to complete a business combination through a “reverse merger” following such a transaction we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms   additional risks may exist since we will assist a privately held business to become public through a “reverse merger” securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock no assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our postmerger company in the future   we cannot assure you that following a business combination with an operating business our common stock will be listed on nasdaq or any other securities exchange   following a business combination we may seek the listing of our common stock on nasdaq or the american stock exchange however we cannot assure you that following such a transaction we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other stock exchange after completing a business combination until our common stock is listed on the nasdaq or another stock exchange we expect that our common stock would be eligible to trade on the otc bulletin board another overthecounter quotation system or on the “pink sheets” where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock in addition we would be subject to an sec rule that if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule imposes various practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors consequently such rule may deter brokerdealers from recommending or selling our common stock which may further affect its liquidity this would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination     there is no public market for our common stock nor have we ever paid dividends on our common stock   there is no public trading market for our common stock and none is expected to develop in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete a business combination with an operating business and such business files a registration statement under the securities act of  as amended   additionally we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future we anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be reinvested into the company to further its business strategy   authorization of preferred stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with designations rights and preferences determined from time to time by its board of directors accordingly our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock in the event of issuance the preferred stock could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control of the company although we have no present intention to issue any shares of its authorized preferred stock there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future   control by management management does not directly control of all the issued and outstanding common stock of the company abina asean co ltd an entity owned and controlled by our president chief executive officer and chairman andrew khor poh kiang holds  of our outstanding common stock additionally abina company ltd recently acquired  shares of common stock from a former shareholder both abina asean co ltd and abina company ltd are controlled by andrew khor poh kiang and his wife manichan khor therefore our president chief executive officer and chairman andrew khor poh kiang is an indirect owner of  of our common stock through these controlled entities consequently he has the ability to control the operations of the company and will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to stockholders for approval including     table of contents   • election of the board of directors     • removal of any directors     • amendment of the company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws and     • adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger takeover or other business combination   abina asean co ltd and abina company ltd both an entities owned and controlled by our president chief executive officer and chairman andrew khor poh kiang and his wife manichan khor are indirect beneficial owner of  shares or  of our common stock accordingly this concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business consolidation or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the common stock   this report contains forwardlooking statements

paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay dividends prior to the completion of a business combination the payment of dividends in the future will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination the payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our then board of directors it is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings if any for use in our business operations and accordingly our board does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future   securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   the company does not have any equity compensation plans or any individual compensation arrangements with respect to its common stock or preferred stock the issuance of any of our common or preferred stock is within the discretion of our board of

the company makes any acquisitions mergers or other business combination the company will file a form k but until such time the company remains a shell company   the company’s board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued common stock without stockholder approval the company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock however the company will in all likelihood issue a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination since the company expects to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination existing stockholders of the company may experience substantial dilution in their shares however it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result in dilution to existing shareholders if the target has a relatively weak balance sheet a business combination may result in significant dilution if a target has a relatively strong balance sheet there may be little or no dilution   issuer purchases of equity securities   none   item   selected financial data   as a “smaller reporting company” as defined by item  of regulation sk the

is due to general and administrative expenses as discussed above   andes  inc company or the registrant was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on july   and has been inactive since inception on february   following the entry of a the consent in lieu of shareholder meeting and the b resolutions of the board of directors and c resolutions of the board of directors all dated on february   the following events occurred which resulted in a change of control of the company the company redeemed an aggregate of  from its former sole shareholder of the then  shares of outstanding stock held at a redemption price of  per share for an aggregate redemption price of  the former sole shareholder proceeded to resign from his director and officer positions as the sole shareholder at the time and prior to his resignation as the sole director former sole shareholder appointed andrew khor poh kiang to serve as director on the board of directors   the company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition merger exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business andes  inc has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders and filing a registration statement andes  inc has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of     the company registered its common stock on a form  registration statement filed pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the exchange act and rule g thereof the company files with the securities and exchange commission periodic and current reports under rule a of the exchange act including quarterly reports on form q and annual reports form k   to become a publiclytraded company andes  inc may file a registration statement most likely on form s or alternatively that a company first effect a business combination with andes  inc and then subsequently file a registration statement a company may choose to effect a business combination with andes  inc before filing a registration statement   if a target company chooses to enter into business combination with andes  inc the registration statement will be prepared after such business combination the terms of a business combination may provide for redemption of all or part of their stock in andes  inc usually at par   a combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended    no assurances can be given that andes  inc will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company   the most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived benefits of a reporting corporation such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees increasing the opportunity to use securities for acquisitions providing liquidity for shareholders and other factors business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex      table of contents   in analyzing prospective business opportunities management may consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements history of operations if any prospects for the future nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management the potential for further research development or exploration specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which may be anticipated the potential for growth or expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products services or trades name identification and other relevant factors this discussion of the proposed criteria is not meant to be restrictive of the virtually unlimited discretion of the company to search for and enter into potential business opportunities   the search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific kind of business entities but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its business life it is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the company may become engaged whether such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture licensing agreement or other arrangement with another corporation or entity on the consummation of a transaction it is likely that the present management and shareholders of the company will no longer be in control of the company in addition it is likely that the officer and director of the company will as part of the terms of the business combination resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors   it is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of its transaction the company may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter if such registration occurs it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination the issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the companys securities may depress the market value of the companys securities in the future if such a market develops of which there is no assurance   while the terms of a business transaction to which the company may be a party cannot be predicted it is expected that the parties to the business transaction will desire to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a taxfree reorganization under sections  or  of the internal revenue code of  as amended    the company will participate in a business combination after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto will specify certain events of default will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms    the board of directors has passed a resolution which contains a policy that the company will not seek a business combination with any entity in which the companys officer director shareholder
