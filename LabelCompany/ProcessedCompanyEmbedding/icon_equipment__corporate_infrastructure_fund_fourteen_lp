corporation pte ltd “jurong” is a newly constructed  billion stateofthe art aromatics plant we participated in a subordinated equipment loan in april  alongside standard chartered bank and bp singapore pte ltd that was part of the  billion financing package that included over  million in equity from strategic investors while the plant was completed on time a combination of industry headwinds downturn in commodities and the chinese economic slowdown forced jurong into receivership as the company does not have the liquidity to commence operations as part of the receivership we are hoping that there will be a consensual restructuring with the senior lenders shareholders and trade creditors given the current distressed situation we have taken a credit reserve that values the asset at  of original cost our investment manager believes that a restructuring is the best option and given the cyclical nature of the industry that jurong participates in and the fact that this a stateoftheart plant if margins follow historical patterns there is a chance the investment may recover some or all of its value   geden holdings limited geden lines “geden” is an international shipping company based in turkey  we entered into a saleleaseback with geden for one tanker the center and two dry bulkers the amazing and fantastic while the tanker market has recovered and the outlook is stable there are extreme headwinds facing the dry bulk market mostly as a result of the slowdown in the chinese economy which for years was driven by heavy investment that fueled ton mile demand for steel coal and iron ore  as china moves towards a consumerdriven economy demand for these commodities has slowed significantly in april  we were informed by geden that it intends to return the three vessels to us prior to lease expiration and that it will not be fulfilling its purchase obligations with respect to the three vessels as a result we determined to record credit losses of   and  related to the amazing the fantastic and the center respectively during the three months ended march   based primarily on the current fair market value of the vessels in anticipation of geden returning the three vessels to us prior to lease expiration we recently signed a term sheet for a proposed charter with respect to the amazing and the fantastic that will provide us revenue sharing in the charterers proprietary book of cargo and we are engaging stena bulk ab to operate the center in the stena sonangol suezmax pool we have also signed term sheets to restructure the debt on these vessels  since the vessels are young and these sectors have historically been highly cyclical we believe these vessels could still recover in value       page             ico
