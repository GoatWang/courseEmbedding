our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

general answers in a sidebyside format if you’re wondering about the differences between an llc and incorporation this may help you decide what entity is best for you once you have made your decision consider one of our many businesses for sale in wyoming question ccorporation llc scorp type of ownership stock there may be different classes membership interests there may be different classes of membership stock but only one class but can have voting and nonvoting eligible owners no restrictions no restrictions shareholder limit  no nonindividual and no nonresident alien shareholders management managed by directors and officers managed by all members or designated managers directors and officers allocations of ownership no  dividends must be paid based upon stock ownership permitted if the allocations have substantial economic effect income gain and loss pass through to the shareholders based on percentage of shares owned liability of owner there is limited liability for shareholders officers and directors there is limited liability for owners and managers there is limited liability for shareholders officers and directors duration indefinitely dissolves at the time specified in the operating agreement or upon the loss of a member unless other members agree to continue indefinitely transfer of ownership shares freely transferred there maybe restrictions under certain state laws shares can be transferred only to eligible s corporation shareholders   tax information ccorporation llc scorp tax rate graduated tax rates from  up to  apply to taxable income personal service corporations are taxed at  of all income there is no tax to the llc on llc income  all profits or losses pass through and are taxed to the members there is no tax except in two limited circumstances  recognized builtin gains and   excess passive income pass through of losses losses not passed through losses passed through to members subject to certain restrictions losses passed through to shareholders subject to certain restrictions fiscal year may use any fiscal year  personal service corps must use a calendar year subject to certain exceptions must use tax year of members having a majority interest in the llc or the tax year of all principal members if there is no majority member must use calendar year subject to certain exceptions liabilities and basis not

potential double taxation corporation is taxed on sale of assets shareholders taxed on dividends or capital gains tax single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets  generally no tax on distribution of appreciated assets single tax at member level potential builtin gains taxed if corp had appreciated property at time of s corp election llc footnotes here are a couple of other points about an llc vs a corporation if you are looking for state tax savings an llc passes the tax through to the members so if the members are in a state where you pay state taxes you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the llc also in an llc you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership here is an example there are two members in an llc that own it  however one member is an investor only who wants to protect hisher investment by controlling  of the company but the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than  of the profit just write in the agreement that the working member gets  of the profits even though heshe only own  of the business scorp footnotes here’s a point about the scorporation that could give people paying themselves a salary an edge with an scorp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary you can take the balance as profit income this could lower the amount of selfemployment taxes that you have to pay also in wyoming we establish all corporations as c corporations wyoming does not have any state taxes so has no need for s corporations if you want s corporation status and do not have a wyoming llc you must file form  with the irs which is included in the corporate kit we send you within  days from the date of formation of the company or by march th of any given tax year there are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form you should consult with your legal andor accounting professional to make sure

companies nominees solo k llc trusts move your company go public have someone contact you newsletter about us disclaimer and privacy privacy policy site map renew prices order here wyoming vs nevada vs delaware where you should incorporate  nevadavswyoming –delaware – side by side comparison –why wyoming nevada vs wyoming wyoming state fees are  less than nevada’s  just add that wyoming corporation advantage up  be sure and include the nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of  that you learn about only after you start your company there a fee nevada will hit you within  days after you start your company and the  or more filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue   oh and add to that the state business license fee of  per year for a corporation  you are going to be paying at least  per year or more in nevada for a corporation before any other services wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees this means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in nevada and your wyoming state renewal fee is  in most cases  less than what you will pay in nevada and the nice thing about wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here  wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years  we even offer shelf company services click here for pricing according to the new  edition of the tax foundation’s state business tax climate index “wyoming has the most businessfriendly tax system of any state” for the past  years in a row perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in nevada here are some reasons explaining why we think wyoming is the best state to incorporate  nevada does not share information with the irs wyoming answer nevada makes the irs mad wyoming does share information with the irs but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state  so the irs is not targeting you because you are in a nonfriendly state like they may in nevada  nevada allows bearer shares wyoming answer nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares but that law was changed in  to disallow bearer shares  if you think you need bearer shares call us first  you are most likely being misled  all states have outlawed bearer shares  nevada has privacy wyoming answer go to the secretary of state of nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name andor first name  you will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in nevada  go to the secretary of state of wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name  you cannot search using a person’s name  no taxes in nevada wyoming answer no state income taxes on people or companies in wyoming and wyoming is not considering any– nevada is  as of july of  nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax no deductions allowed for some corporations  that will mean that some companies in nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in california  in fact some nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation don’t gamble on nevada research nevada incorporation myths exploding the delaware myth you may have heard that delaware is the “incorporation capital” of america it’s true  more than  of fortune  companies are incorporated in delaware  if you own a fortune  company and for your sake we hope you do then by all means you should strongly consider incorporating in delaware  however if you are a small or mediumsized business that is more concerned with tax benefits flexibility privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape” then wyoming is the clear choice for you you see delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning  years regarding such matters as managementshareholder issues and mergersacquisitions  that’s precisely why the fortune  are drawn to the state of delaware  delaware laws tend to be “promanagement” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes  huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day  so if you are managing a fortune  company delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do and what the likely consequences may be  unfortunately delaware also has corporate income tax personal income tax a state franchise tax reporting requirements and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you  we are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business entrepreneur clients to incorporate in delaware  well intentioned though it may be it is not sound advice perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in delaware  it’s not too late  refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to wyoming and enjoy the advantages while preserving the original incorporation date compare states easily with the chart below a side by side comparison of wyoming and nevada and delaware benefits nevada wyoming delaware no state corporate income tax no public listing of the names of members or managers in an llc no franchise tax minimal annual fees oneperson corporation is allowed stockholders are not revealed to the state no annual report is required until the anniversary of the incorporation date unlimited stock is allowed of any par value share certificates are not required minimal initial filing fees no minimum capital requirements meetings may be held anywhere officers directors employees and agents are statutorily indemnified continuance procedure allows wyoming to adopt a corporation formed in another state why wyoming as you can see from the above list when comparing nevada vs wyoming incorporation advantages wyoming has several that nevada does not also with the changes that nevada has made to its laws in     and in  wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in if you are comparing price wyoming is about  less to incorporate in than nevada another thing that they will not tell you about nevada  the state is running a deficit and the nevada state legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax  they did pass a gross receipts tax in  which is the worst tax there is since it does not allow for deductions wyoming is not considering any business income tax  don’t gamble on nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today check out the advantages of incorporating in wyoming lower startup costs privacy allowed

general answers in a sidebyside format if you’re wondering about the differences between an llc and incorporation this may help you decide what entity is best for you once you have made your decision consider one of our many businesses for sale in wyoming question ccorporation llc scorp type of ownership stock there may be different classes membership interests there may be different classes of membership stock but only one class but can have voting and nonvoting eligible owners no restrictions no restrictions shareholder limit  no nonindividual and no nonresident alien shareholders management managed by directors and officers managed by all members or designated managers directors and officers allocations of ownership no  dividends must be paid based upon stock ownership permitted if the allocations have substantial economic effect income gain and loss pass through to the shareholders based on percentage of shares owned liability of owner there is limited liability for shareholders officers and directors there is limited liability for owners and managers there is limited liability for shareholders officers and directors duration indefinitely dissolves at the time specified in the operating agreement or upon the loss of a member unless other members agree to continue indefinitely transfer of ownership shares freely transferred there maybe restrictions under certain state laws shares can be transferred only to eligible s corporation shareholders   tax information ccorporation llc scorp tax rate graduated tax rates from  up to  apply to taxable income personal service corporations are taxed at  of all income there is no tax to the llc on llc income  all profits or losses pass through and are taxed to the members there is no tax except in two limited circumstances  recognized builtin gains and   excess passive income pass through of losses losses not passed through losses passed through to members subject to certain restrictions losses passed through to shareholders subject to certain restrictions fiscal year may use any fiscal year  personal service corps must use a calendar year subject to certain exceptions must use tax year of members having a majority interest in the llc or the tax year of all principal members if there is no majority member must use calendar year subject to certain exceptions liabilities and basis not

potential double taxation corporation is taxed on sale of assets shareholders taxed on dividends or capital gains tax single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets  generally no tax on distribution of appreciated assets single tax at member level potential builtin gains taxed if corp had appreciated property at time of s corp election llc footnotes here are a couple of other points about an llc vs a corporation if you are looking for state tax savings an llc passes the tax through to the members so if the members are in a state where you pay state taxes you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the llc also in an llc you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership here is an example there are two members in an llc that own it  however one member is an investor only who wants to protect hisher investment by controlling  of the company but the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than  of the profit just write in the agreement that the working member gets  of the profits even though heshe only own  of the business scorp footnotes here’s a point about the scorporation that could give people paying themselves a salary an edge with an scorp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary you can take the balance as profit income this could lower the amount of selfemployment taxes that you have to pay also in wyoming we establish all corporations as c corporations wyoming does not have any state taxes so has no need for s corporations if you want s corporation status and do not have a wyoming llc you must file form  with the irs which is included in the corporate kit we send you within  days from the date of formation of the company or by march th of any given tax year there are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form you should consult with your legal andor accounting professional to make sure

vs delaware where you should incorporate  nevadavswyoming –delaware – side by side comparison –why wyoming nevada vs wyoming wyoming state fees are  less than nevada’s  just add that wyoming corporation advantage up  be sure and include the nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of  that you learn about only after you start your company there a fee nevada will hit you within  days after you start your company and the  or more filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue   oh and add to that the state business license fee of  per year for a corporation  you are going to be paying at least  per year or more in nevada for a corporation before any other services wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees this means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in nevada and your wyoming state renewal fee is  in most cases  less than what you will pay in nevada and the nice thing about wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here  wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years  we even offer shelf company services click here for pricing according to the new  edition of the tax foundation’s state business tax climate index “wyoming has the most businessfriendly tax system of any state” for the past  years in a row perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in nevada here are some reasons explaining why we think wyoming is the best state to incorporate  nevada does not share information with the irs wyoming answer nevada makes the irs mad wyoming does share information with the irs but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state  so the irs is not targeting you because you are in a nonfriendly state like they may in nevada  nevada allows bearer shares wyoming answer nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares but that law was changed in  to disallow bearer shares  if you think you need bearer shares call us first  you are most likely being misled  all states have outlawed bearer shares  nevada has privacy wyoming answer go to the secretary of state of nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name andor first name  you will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in nevada  go to the secretary of state of wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name  you cannot search using a person’s name  no taxes in nevada wyoming answer no state income taxes on people or companies in wyoming and wyoming is not considering any– nevada is  as of july of  nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax no deductions allowed for some corporations  that will mean that some companies in nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in california  in fact some nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation don’t gamble on nevada research nevada incorporation myths exploding the delaware myth you may have heard that delaware is the “incorporation capital” of america it’s true  more than  of fortune  companies are incorporated in delaware  if you own a fortune  company and for your sake we hope you do then by all means you should strongly consider incorporating in delaware  however if you are a small or mediumsized business that is more concerned with tax benefits flexibility privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape” then wyoming is the clear choice for you you see delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning  years regarding such matters as managementshareholder issues and mergersacquisitions  that’s precisely why the fortune  are drawn to the state of delaware  delaware laws tend to be “promanagement” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes  huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day  so if you are managing a fortune  company delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do and what the likely consequences may be  unfortunately delaware also has corporate income tax personal income tax a state franchise tax reporting requirements and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you  we are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business entrepreneur clients to incorporate in delaware  well intentioned though it may be it is not sound advice perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in delaware  it’s not too late  refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to wyoming and enjoy the advantages while preserving the original incorporation date compare states easily with the chart below a side by side comparison of wyoming and nevada and delaware benefits nevada wyoming delaware no state corporate income tax no public listing of the names of members or managers in an llc no franchise tax minimal annual fees oneperson corporation is allowed stockholders are not revealed to the state no annual report is required until the anniversary of the incorporation date unlimited stock is allowed of any par value share certificates are not required minimal initial filing fees no minimum capital requirements meetings may be held anywhere officers directors employees and agents are statutorily indemnified continuance procedure allows wyoming to adopt a corporation formed in another state why wyoming as you can see from the above list when comparing nevada vs wyoming incorporation advantages wyoming has several that nevada does not also with the changes that nevada has made to its laws in     and in  wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in if you are comparing price wyoming is about  less to incorporate in than nevada another thing that they will not tell you about nevada  the state is running a deficit and the nevada state legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax  they did pass a gross receipts tax in  which is the worst tax there is since it does not allow for deductions wyoming is not considering any business income tax  don’t gamble on nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today check out the advantages of incorporating in wyoming lower startup costs privacy allowed
