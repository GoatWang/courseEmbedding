interim cmo alan batey  gm authority sponsored links an interview with gm interim cmo alan batey  by gm authority staff — aug   sponsored links last week’s widelypublicized and surprising departure of gm chief marketing officer joel ewanick is understood to have been the result of several highprofile controversial decisions including the discontinuation of facebook ads days ahead of the social media company’s ipo withdrawal from super bowl advertising and the sponsorship of two uk soccer teams but all that is now history as gm has appointed an interim cmo and is continuing with the execution of the strategies set out by ewanick conveniently the folks at car  driver have recently interviewed alan batey the interim chief of marketing whose primary role is the vp of sales and service the year gm vet first started at vauxhall in the uk and has since worked for the automaker in germany dubai korea and australia during the interview batey confirms that there will be no change in marketing direction and sheds light on several other interesting items including the reasoning for the decision to not advertise during next year’s super bowl as it relates to the new sponsorships of machester united and liverpool the lag between the company’s products and public perception and the automaker’s opportunities in the bric markets among other things here’s the transcript of the cd interview cd can you confirm what’s in the newspapers—gm isn’t changing marketing strategies alan batey that’s right there’s no change in direction cd so still no super bowl alan batey here in the us we have percent unaided awareness of chevrolet and other gm brands we don’t necessarily need to be present there and remember that the chevrolet brand is still a huge sponsor of other sports like baseball cd what needs to be done for chevrolet ads and marketing in the us then alan batey i’ll be honest in the past our brand was weakened product was just not the most competitive now the product really is competitive but the brand is still not at the strength it needs to be there’s a lag between perception and where our products actually are cd this is sounding a lot like something we would have heard a decade ago from bob lutz and others that there’s a perception gap gm has to overcome how are you going to succeed where others didn’t alan batey i’m a big believer in facts when we went from the cobalt to the cruze we made a quantum leap we’re marketing some fantastic products now cd so why is gm paying hundreds of millions of dollars to put chevrolet on the jerseys and stadiums of english soccer teams manchester united and liverpool chevy is outranked even by seat in uk sales—and seat’s sales are so bad vw wants to kill it alan batey manchester united and liverpool are two of the most popular sports teams in the world and they’re on tv screens everywhere this is a powerful global platform for the chevrolet brand to raise awareness in places we’re not as known so this really isn’t alan bateyout the uk cd if the idea is to expand chevrolet as a global brand like vw or toyota what alan bateyout opel and daewoo and holden which rebadge and sell many chevy models in markets where the chevy brand does not exist alan batey we’re really looking at places that will grow especially the socalled bric brazil russia india and china countries these are opportunities for chevrolet and from a marketing standpoint places where there is less unaided awareness alan bateyout the brand sport is a great way to reach out to these markets the gm authority take the fact that gm isn’t changing the direction of its marketing operations may be proof positive that the strategy set forth by ewanick holds water and that something outside the man’s onthejob performance was the reason for his resignation in fact the decision to substitute next year’s super bowl advertisements with the sponsorships of two european football teams makes that much more sense once one realized the colossal opportunity the chevrolet brand faces in growth markets such as brazil russia india and china but we do find batey’s elusive answer to the opelholdendaewoo question rather troubling as gm does not seem to have a clear strategy of chevrolet in the markets where opel and vauxhall are sold and the longer it remains this way the worse for gm sponsored links check out the latest forum

technologies that significantly decrease page load times thanks so much for your feedback — it’s always appreciated keep it coming more to come soon alex reply todd bianco says august   at  am i’m not sure that interview told us anything new the information that everyone wants is what actions – specifically – led to the firing of joel ewanick there is a story there particularly if gm is officially “staying the course” with ewanick’s decisions and direction i’m still not convinced that the boffo deal with manchester united  liverpool makes that much sense for the bric countries and while those franchises are extremely popular or hated throughout the uk and europe i think that kind of money may have been better spent through alternative forms of advertising or sponsorship then there is the brand confusion and what will happen to opelvauxhall and holden in europe i had hoped that opel would move upmarket – closer to buick – and chevy would handle the lower end and extra capacity at opel would be shifted to chevrolet but that’s not going to happen either it still looks like opel and chevy are gunning for the same lower end of the market why and where all this leaves holden in the european mix is anyone’s guess what next maybe gm will just rename holden to chevrolet and throw away  years of brand equity in australia i also think that skipping the super bowl is a mistake for the us market viewers are expecting chevrolet to participate just because it always does and with the introduction of the new silverado you’d think the sb would be the perfect venue i feel sorry for alan batey — it’s got to be a high stress position with a target on his back something bad went down and he is expected to soothe the ruffled feathers of pissed off managers who knows what the powers that be want changed or want him to do what internal goals or targets does he need to hit i wish him luck reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are

presidents next challenge getting young urbanites to buy trax mini suv we dont look at everything through tv advertising by michael mccarthy published on april   alan batey most popular alan batey general motors presidentnorth america is one of those marketers who fills the room with his big laugh and hailfellowwellmet persona hes the type of guy who could talk a bird out of a tree during a media scrum at the new york international auto show this week he joked that he and the media pack surrounding him should take the conversation to the bar but mr batey is facing a tricky advertising challenge  selling an suv to young city dwellers during an auto show event mr bates announced that chevy will launch a small suv in the us called trax describing the vehicle as designed for urban adventures mr batey said hell aim trax at urban pioneers looking to discover the city to help grab these techsavvy consumerstrax will feature among other things a wireless hotspot that allows up to seven people to use their wireless devices at the same time chevy trax but it might need more than that to lure urban millennials research indicates many of the young citydwelling hipsters mr batey wants to target prefer taking the bus subway or bike to get around town when they need cars they opt for carsharing services like zipcar and enterprise carshare to avoid the expense and hassle of owning and parking a car advertising age asked mr batey how hell pull it off he was also pressed on whether gm will address the ignitionswitch recall in its advertising and marketing and how the britishborn soccer fan feels about chevys bowtie logo finally going on the front of manchester united jerseys later this year excerpts ad age young hipsters dont buy a lot of cars why are you marketing trax at this tough crowd of consumers and how do you reach them mr batey they are buying cars clearly when youre doing marketing positioning you build out from the persona of the customer youre leaning into theyre out there people like to drive these crossovertype vehicles this is a great segment    we dont look at everything through tv advertising when we launched the sonic here in the us we didnt do any tv advertising at all everything we did was in the digital space we had huge success as you know sonic is no  or no  month in month out in the small car segment chevys global cmo tim mahoney is here tonight were planning the trax launch as we speak were not going to be just traditional we really want to lean into these people using all the digital uses we can ad age despite several months of controversy gm has yet to address the ignitionswitch recall controversy in its advertising we havent seen the fullpage ads companies typically employ in these situations instead mary barra is leading gms response through writtenvideo statements and testimony before congress will this change mr batey at this moment in time weve said everything we can about the recalls we are obviously extremely sorry about what happened weve told everybody were going to do this full investigation using the best people we can to go where the facts are ad age but should you address it in your advertising mr batey at this moment in time theres no need to what weve got is a good balance weve put the facts out there people understand the facts theyre visiting our showrooms and theyre buying our vehicles as evidenced by the fact that we outpaced the industry last month  recalls are part of our industry its a big recall but there was also one of our competitors toyota last week announced a huge global recall so theyre part of our business ad age is gm finally breathing easier over chevys highly criticized  million sponsorship of manchester united now that the bowtie will finally go on the front of jerseys this season mr batey this is about unaided awareness around the world soccer is a global sport so were excited about it happening we have some big ideas were going to execute we announced a game at the big house in michigan sold it out in  hours it will be one of the largest soccer crowds in the us editors note manu will play real madrid at the university of michigans michigan stadium on aug  well use the manu sponsorship everywhere well use it in china and asia but i think its also going to be great here in the us  soccers one of the most popular sports for male and female children thats going to continue to grow so i believe soccer is going to be one of the really huge sports in the us and it doesnt get bigger than manchester united ad age will chevy advertise during world cup mr batey were not an official sponsor like the olympics only those brands that official sponsors are allowed to use the logo and be the official sponsor but having manchester united in your portfolio if you want puts you in there even though youre not directly linked ad age what do you think of the huge reaction to cadillacs controversial poolside

chevy runs deep tagline for find new roads by rupal parekh published on january   since its founding in  in motor city chevrolet has gone from being as american as apple pie to a global brand that s selling some  million cars and trucks in more than  markets that evolution means the patriotic messaging used to sell the brand to consumers in the past  slogans such as see the usa in your chevrolet heartbeat of america an american revolution and its most recent rally cry chevy runs deep  wont resonate with a huge segment of the market anymore so parent company general motors co today announced a new tagline for the brand find new roads chevy runs deep the previous tagline was ushered in by former cmo joel ewanick and us agency goodby silverstein  partners mr ewanick brought in the omnicom shop after he tossed aside longtime campbellewald and publicis and they unveiled the tag during the world series in  gm was immediately met with wide criticism from car buffs who claimed that chevy runs deep lacked substance with jalopnik going so far as to call it as the worst slogan ever jeff goodby one of the partners at goodby came to the taglines defense predicting that it would eventually have legs despite continued criticism and a global review gm said in october of  that it was sticking by its choice but a year later amid slips in market share and following the ouster of mr ewanick gm was openly announcing the possibility of axing it we might transition chris perry chevrolets vpmarketing told ad age sibling publication automotive news in october of  that became definite today with gms announcement of find new roads it will be used to market nearly  new or revamped vehicles around the world and it will also be used as an internal mantra the new positioning which was developed by chevys agency of record detroitbased commonwealth marks the second major change under interim cmo alan batey who stepped in to replace mr ewanick in july commonwealth is an omnicom and interpublic joint venture composed of executives from omnicoms goodby silverstein  partners and interpublics mccann erickson burying chevy runs deep comes at a time when general motors is focused on markets like india and russia and market share for its largest brand chevy has been slipping its also been cutting marketing spending domestically gm spent  billion during the first three quarters of  compared with  billion during the same period in   a  decline according to kantar media the marketing spending on chevy for the first nine months of  was  million down from  million an  decline according to kantar media alan batey so how long can we expect find new roads to stay intact mr batey has asked mary barra and ed welburn gms heads of product development and design respectively to help with making the theme a part of company culture going forward unlike those taglines that have come and gone he predicts this one will stick around for at least a decade ad age  when chevy runs deep was launched it was met with criticism but gm asked for the public to be patient and said that theyd see it was a campaign that would ultimately resonate and convey the passion of the brands fans does this mean the critics were right mr batey what i would say is that it was a campaign that was developed and implemented around the time of our centennial when you have a centennial you have an opportunity to look back on your history  chevy has a rich history and i think the campaign  and all the results track this out  did well at that point in time now we are taking it on the global stage to the next level we are the fastestgrowing major vehicle brand in the world today and have  new launches around the world in  find new roads is more than a tagline and in fact i would say for it to be successful we have to create internal alignment we want find new roads to become for all of us our north star  something that inspires us and builds around that spirit of ingenuity ad age  what makes you confident that find new roads works more meaningfully and works on a global level mr batey we have been working on this for the last five or six months hand in hand with commonwealth our global agency from day one weve been looking at this from a global perspective we know it creates a lot of meaning and is also very flexible you can think of two vehicles in very different spaces perhaps a volt and a heavy duty truck and it applies to both we also think it translates into the services we provide our customers it gives us an opportunity to surprise and delight our customers ad age  you say this is meant not just to be a tagline but an internal mantra as much as an external one what are you doing to get those working at gm at all levels in all positions to rally behind the positioning mr batey we have a meeting with our senior execs which will take place next week during the detroit auto show it gives us a great chance to speak with all of our senior execs around the world about the new approach theyll obviously take that back to their teams ill also be doing somewhat of our a world tour to ensure consistency it will start toward the end of february ad age  after having such a strong presence in previous years what will it be like to sit on the sidelines for the super bowl this year do still you think that was the right decision mr batey it definitely was the right decision we had success with the super bowl in the past and if you use it correctly it can be a great platform stay posted and youll see some of the innovative things were going to in the future ad age  you recently moved silverado duties to leo burnett aligning all truck advertising under the publicis agency now this announcement about the tagline changes can we expect you to undertake more ad changes in  mr batey no those really were the two big ones we needed to put in place to make sure we have a successful  when we have  newproduct launches around the world for chevy ad age  so you are happy with the way that the commonwealth structure  which has been an unprecedented partnership between competing ad companies  is working for general motors mr batey yeah i really am we came together on this global effort at the same time we previously had not operated as a brand on a global level we have got some great global learnings im feeling good about where we are right now  im very excited ad age  its been a busy few months for you since youve made the transition to the cmo role how have you found it mr batey if i take you back to when i took this role on in the july time frame i stressed it wasnt about one person but a team we have got great people and ive really enjoyed it its been a fantastic time we always new that looking into  it would be an incredibly busy time ad age  what can we expect with regards to the search for a permanent cmo mr batey as i sit here today were still looking at our options and havent gotten anything to announce yet in this article cmo
