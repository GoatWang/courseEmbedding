you go about determining why that has happened answersthis is a test to see how you think on your feetadword revenue  no of impressions  click thru rate  cost per click anyone of the three parameters could decline to have an overall reduction in revenue no of impressions could go down if a the internet usage has fallen for some socioculturaal reasons in italy b the usage of google search has reduced because of may be some competitor applicaton launch or some major marketing promotion activities c some major technical issues has come up may be in the google servers which is resulting in higher latency in google search applications resulting in reduced usage click thru rate might have gone down  major shift is usage clusters keywords used have changed resulting in changed search behavior where in people are less prone to click thru  some technical issues like adds not displayed properly same major flaw in random add picking might have got introduced  some recent layout change has been there and peope are yet to get accustomed with the changed layout reduced cpc  people are spending less on adwords and hence bidding less  due to the keyword change the new cluster cpc is much lesser determine the amount of decrease in month over month percentages and make sure this isnt a trend  assuming weve seen similar decreases in conversions and clicks  days is a months time lets say this is in august when the entire country uses the majority of their average of  vacation days per year thats a factor  given youve said decreases in revenue and assuming all click and conversion

asked oct   what me through the project lifecycle answeri walked through business creating case requirement formulation design development testing lauchsenior product manager at amazon was asked aug   the manager of component a says his functionality is more important than that of component b the manager of component b says his is more important than that of component a you can only implement one a or b but not both  which do you choose to implement answersi reference the product plan and select the component w the higher priority the interview says there is no product plan i say i select the one w the higher roi they say there is no roi i say then i choose the component whose manager has the best rationalei would say to do my own researchi would say whichever is more valuable to customer  gives competitive advantage to amazonshow more responsesthe key question to ask is definition of important is it important to the managers ego equation important to the end consumer or important for amazon the first one needs to be thrown out immediately and the others must be quantified based on achievability impact on end user and roiagreed need to drill into what important means great catch my guess is that amazon was looking to quantifydefine important from the customer perspectivei would recommend doing a data collection plan on the functionality  can you quantify the functionality and its execution be turned into hours saved steps minimized bottlenecks reduced inefficiencies gainedi would recommend doing a data collection plan on the functionality  can you quantify the functionality and its execution be turned into hours saved steps minimized bottlenecks reduced inefficiencies gainedin addition to the above suggestions i would look at cost and time to market and then score both options then define value metrics the cheapest and most valuable either as a technology sustainer or for customer wins given that its amazon customer value will hold up the highest as one of their corporate culture virtueshow was important defined and what data backs up the claim what is the impact of selecting component a v b on budget time to market feature creep deadlines etc another key data point is what is the risk of selecting one over the other are both important enough to change the release plan or can one be added later as a product improvementi would collect data and take the decision type of data that you need collect depends on functionalitiesthis must be escalated to the program management team or a higher authority to make a decision this decision should not be made at the level of a product managementsenior product manager social media advertising at amazon was asked jun   tell me how you would scale a social media software platform answersi didnt have a good answer for this oneits such a tricky question i guess its by the analytic we use to know the page views and alltry to define scale ask for clarifications are we trying to scale to more users or to more ad providers are there any current bottlenecks what is the goal here how about we improve the experience by providing more relevant ads etcproduct marketing manager at klatencor was asked may   how will you position the current legacy product considering that the next generation product is beginning to be offered answerthe answer they were looking for was that the legacy product should be offerred tothe price sensitive customers while migrating other customers to the more expensive advanced newer productproduct marketing manager at juniper networks was asked nov   can you tell me how you would manage a new product launch  answeri would put together a launch plan with input from the necessary teams product management engineering testing support a part of the plan would include schedule key stakeholders and responsible team members and key deliverables and milestones with dates i would arrange weekly meetings leading up to the launch date and manage the progress on each of the milestones and deliverables by coordinating with each of the team membersproduct marketing manager at aruba networks was asked sep   tell me the thought process and planning as well as the execution in the launching a product x or creating a positioning for a productfeature y  answerstart with the target customer the use case and the differentiation of this productproduct marketing manager at hewlettpackard was asked apr   if germans were the tallest people in the world how would you prove it answersi first asked how would we define germans people who were born in germany people who lived in germany from east or west the food they ate had to do likely w  and stuff like thatmanpoorly constructed question we only have to prove it if germans are the tallest people in the world therefore if we are forced to prove it it must be the case that germans are actually the tallest people we could also randomly sample heights from people considered german and compare it to a random sampling of heights from people in nongerman groups we are interested in assuming we have resources to get large enough samples and can account for a variety of biases some anova and other stats stuff can get us the answerask yourself who you are supposed to prove it to the question was for a product marketing manager interview could it perhaps be that what they want is to see how you take something you know to be true you have to believe that the products you are trying to sell are great products to be a really great salesperson and convince everyone else of that factshow more responsestheres a lot of poorly defined stuff in here define germans include polish or french post wwii rapes define prove leave no doubt or is a statistical rejection of the null hypothesis acceptable and if so by what percentage define tallest include children under the age of i would check out the guinness book of world records and find out the nationality of the tallest person in the worldid probably say to the interviewer as long as no one can disprove that germans are the tallest people then you really dont have to prove anythinggermans were the tallest people in the world is a statement that is considered to be a statement that is made on basis of some statical analysis data point then thats the proof in given statement conclusion is made prior to the proofit would be an appropriate question if there was no if in a questiontake height measurements of a statistically significant sample of germans as well as all other groups to be considered if the average height of the german sample is the highest youve proven what was to be proveni can think of two different ways to get a quick insight into this  survey mcdonalds get them to count the heights of the first  people in the door on a given day then compare that information i havent done the confidence math on this  call the levi strauss company and ask them what distribution of pants they sell around the world bluejeans are sold just about everywhere so except for the possibility that leg length isnt an exact indicator of overall height i for example have short legs for my height they should be able to tell you how tall people are in any given country based on the pants they sell thereyou can prove that there is a statistically significant difference between  classes using a tailed students t test it just requires the average and standard deviation of each class instead of just giving up and saying we cant define who is german pick a definition of what a german is  take their average height and standard deviation and compare it to the average and standard deviation of the rest of the world using the tailed students t test or other similar statistical tests collecting height data may not be realistic for  person but if the interviewer asked you the question with no other stipulations then you can fill in the rest pretend you have unlimited resources just assume the data you need is known or can be looked up i think the interviewer wants to hear you think through a problem that displays youre creativity and resourcefulness just saying its not possible wont get you the jobim sorry  i feel uncomfortable with holocaust jokesother than measuring the height directly another possible solution is to use the side effects of taller people eg higher ceilings larger shoes or clothing or maybe its all in the dna anyway just call up an international retailer and ask if they make things bigger for germansshow more responsesi would answer with the following procedure  get the height of the shortest german  get the height of the tallest nongerman if the shortest german is taller than the tallest nongerman then this argument is true otherwise its falsedmv records or likewise entities are available all over the worldresearch engineer wrote pick a definition of what a german well if we are going to pick our own definition mine would be  everyone who is over  is german  everyone under  is not german qedi would look to the medical community cdc or ama possibly the unthe proposed answers seem rather convoluted you would have to prove it by statistics the statistics indicate that the dutch are the tallest people with an average height of  feet for men most of western and eastern europe have surpassed the united states in height due to the us fast food compulsion and inequitable health careif we already know that germans are the tallest people in the world then we dont have to prove itthis is a problem solving question  straight up pure and simple you take the question as a hypothesis and explain how you would go about proving the veracity of the statement if stats exist on the internet thats probably the fastest way to answer the question if there was time an money you could pay for secondary research if it exists or primary research the interviewer only wants to see how logical you are  not to actually solve the problem or question the thesis statementi have to agree driver licenses are a good source for height information httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedgather as large of a sample of german and nongerman heights employ a ttestztest to accept or reject the hypothesis at a given confidence intervalpull out my phone and access wwwguinnessworldrecordscom this one was easy hp needs to come up with more challenging questions if they are to prosper in  hps hr interviewer is now answering similar questions since being fired for lack of defining what he meant by a german tsk tskshow more responsestheir cars would be the biggest if they were indeed the tallestsorry assumptions cannot be proved but let me try to convince you this will strike some conversation just enough time for you to think on how to convince i am sure all this questions do not have a perfect answer they want to check your thought process patiencethe average length of mattress in germany is higher than the other countries then germans are the tallestbefore i do that how will the answer best help us solve our business challengesgermany has the largest number of stores that sell shoes in larger sizes inch and above and foot size is directly proportional to the height of personhence germans are proved to be the tallestif germans were the tallest people in the world i would have to prove it by determining what group is the tallest people in the worldno need  the dutch are the tallest apparentlyif you work with the definition that the country with the tallest median person are the tallest nation you can get to a solution algorithmically assumptions no multiple citizenships allowed median on an even number of persons is the one at positon n for simplicity we have lots of time to do this so we dont care about getting to a result quick  get everybody in a room  ask people to stand together by nations and form a line each  repeat for each line until nobody swaps  ask each person to swap with their right neighbour if that neighbour is shorter  for each line should be sorted by height now  ask the smallest and the largest person of each nation to leave  repeat until only one or two people are left  for each of the pairs left send the shorter one home  repeat until only one person is left  ask the remaining persons to form random pairs dont worry if one person is left standing alone  send all the shorter persons in each pair home  if the remainin person is german  you have proved iti would respond by saying that this is a profiling question and would prefer not to answerdmv records dont include heights in many countries of the world including germany which kind of puts the kibosh on this approach httpenwikipediaorgwikieuropeandrivinglicenceshow more responsesi think average height for adults is available from census or other survays per country now if you consider a person living in germany german citizenshipresidence vs nationality the highest number of your list should be germany theres the proofin the hypothetical world of the question it is a fact that the germans are the tallest a fact is a statement that can be proven so the fact was already proven at some point in the make believe world answer is a question how did the person who proved it before do itin science there is no absolute truth a hypothesis is not proven per se you can support your hypothesis with positive data but you can never really prove it scientifically conclusion your theory that germans are the tallest people can either be supported or negated but not provenuse arrest warrant or inmate records they do have height information because that is an identifying characteristic just like scars marks or tattoosjust check the most selled pant sizeby taking the average height into consideration of every country it would be proved that germans were tallest in the worldanalogy if ab how would you prove it answer i dont need to because you already said that abmeasure the height of the shortest doorway in a railway station or a common everyday place and compare to other nationsgermany is known for the automobile manufacturing giants like bmw etc just measure the the distance from the seat beneath to the rooftop above if it is greater than any other car manufactured then certainly an average germans height would account as the tallestsince in the qn they have used if i wud answer that how can i prove you right or wrong if you itself not sure about the factshow more responsestape measuredmv reporti would show the average height of germans compared to the average height of the rest of the worldlook upi would google itfirst you have to define your population then you have to establish a plan for your research what method are you going to use to gather data and also define your sampling plan the bigger the sample group the more reliable in market research there are several methods to analyze your data establishing your sampling procedure we can use deductive or inductive researchclassic puzzle question with aim to understand a persons thinking process and structure the interviewers original question drilldown approach or any of the statistical approaches are the only correct ways to answer such a problem solving question the others  like pant sizes shoe sizes  are interesting leading questions to lead to the solution you never simply answer such a case question without drilling down on the use cases first apparently the other responders either failed math  proofs are not anywhere near the product spectrum or are random trolls jumping on a hot question sadly they downvoted the best answer and the only one that probably would have passed the interviewassociate product manager at google was asked mar   what is the marginal cost of a gigabyte in gmail answersi had no idea what marginal cost is but after a lot of hints i finally came up with   a gigabyte though thats probably on the low end the right answer is probably a bit higher say    a gigabyte from the costs of servers disk space maintenance set up of servers maintaining webpage designing user interface and then offset by the advertisements and clickthroughsprobably even less than that now httpthenextwebcomdataquarterpricegooglesplanchromeosstorageisnt marginal cost the cost to produce an additional unit so costs like designing the user interface maintaining the webpage which would have to be done no matter the gigabyte capacity shouldnt be accounted forshow more responsesah you clearly would have made a better candidate than i have like i said i didnt know what marginal cost was so i just came up with a ballpark figureheres my guess at what theyre looking for marginal cost  this is the additional cost for adding a user it doesnt need to take in to account the software development effort but it should take out the atomized cost for everything else you need to price out the the cost of the enterprise hdgb we can call it  by gb then you need to realize that there needs to be redundancy so at the lest we need to double that number if they put a super high value on data retention triple it then you need to think about server cost and divide that out server rack space cost and physical rack areaetc so if its  for the actual hd space its probably more like  for the total marginal cost i dont work for google but my guess is that theyre looking at the though process what will change with a marginal user increase and what will not if you only think of the cost of the hd then youre not getting a job with googlethe simplest answer is to look up the amazon s costs currently platoing at cgb and assume that the economics are fairly similarto correct my own post  these are permonth prices so the eternal retention prices would be  times higher which gives us the same figure as jonsconsidering the money they make per account signed up with gmail id say they definitely make money per gigabyte spent for gmail but im not sure how muchi never worry about the capacity of my gmail account it seems to me the cost of an extra gig of gmail storage is zero as it is the mission of google to make sure every users always have enough storage capacity and google is doing a great job in this area so the maginal cost of a gigabyte in gmail should be zeroif it was a cost google would not exist when analyzing costs and especially marginal cost one must consider all aspects once one considers the return too the cost goes into a negativethe marginal cost of adding a gigabyte is either zero or thousands of dollars either the gigabyte is already physically in existence or you would have to build a new server the marginal cost is not averaged across all gigabytes there might be a minor increase in energy consumption due to this extra gigabyte but who will notice that if your goal is to stand out in an interview i would suggest going the thousands of dollars answer for those non computer guys out there lets relate this question to something physical what is the marginal cost of adding one more person to an airline flight their are two situations the plane in not already full so we can essentially neglect the cost of the additional passenger since it is so low the extra energy to move the  pounds when the plane is already moving hundreds of thousands of pounds and the  cents for a soda but if the plane is already full then the marginal cost of one extra passenger is the cost to fly a second plane thousands of dollarsmarginal cost is the cost of adding one additional unit so fixed costs of gmail are already taken care of so the cost is the cost of the hard drive  any labor to install and configure that hard drive for gmail take a sum of the costs and then divide it by the size of the hard drive gb and you should have your rate i think it will be well below a dollar in my quick math i had it at  cents but that assumes consumer pricingproduct manager at google was asked jan   you are on a biz trip and travelling from one city to another you have a stack of unsorted flight boarding passes only departure city and destination city are on the boarding pass how do you find the first departure city and your final destination city answersusing two arrays and searchcant u identify it with the departure city which in this case will match with one of the cities u are currently inyour current location is your departure city your final destination is the city whose name occurs only once among all the city names minus your departure cityshow more responseswhy wouldnt you just look at all of the cities listed on the documents and the two which dont ever repeat are your departure and destination city for the two that dont repeat one will only be listed as a departure and the other one will be the one that is only listed as a destinationi doubt you can assume your current location is your departure the point of this type of problem is to show multiple solutions and also analyze the time complexity one natural solution is to take one boarding pass find the boarding pass with the next one after it and so on you would end up with a sorted stack of boarding passes the method i described take one search the rest for the following city repeat would take order n squared time  n for the first pass n for the second pass and so on you could exit early but the worst case time complexity is the sum from  to n which is order n squared the better solution as gk wrote is to take a boarding pass and write down the names of the two cities and a notation indicating departure or arrival on the next boarding pass do the same if a city is repeated cross it off the list at the end you will have two cities this is order n with order n storage spaceassume this is a acyclic graph a city is not visited again once you leave it now arrange the boarding passes and note the number of times a city appears in departure as well as arrival for all intermediate cities this number will be the same for the initial city the arrivaldeparture   and for the destination arrivaldeparture   now you start traversing from there form a table where you take each node and note the next node for cyclic graphs it is more complex you will still find the initial and destination city the same way but the traversal will be hard iterate over set of boarding passes and maintain a map of city  occurrence count for sourcedestination city at end of iterating over passes you have a map of city  occurrence count  for the keyset of cities get count for each city if source count or destination count   city is in the sourcedestination tuple number each boarding pass from  to n  takes on  create one hash table where you index by departure and iterate over boarding passes and enter indices corresponding to departure city  takes on  now start at  and follow the hash table adding following passes when you reach the end see if there are any boarding passes left if not you are done if there are then start at the first one and keep going until you prepend it to the previous sequence  on hence total time is on  on  on  onthe question asks for the first departure city and final destination city sort the passes in ascending order of departure time using a fixed timezone  lets say est i have observed that boarding passes rarely if at all specify the local timezone but this can be deduced from the departure city doesnt matter how many times you repeat the same departuredestination city the earliest departure time in the stack is your departure the last arrival time in the stack is your destinationno matter how busy you are i guess you would always know the departure city and the destination cities so what you are really looking for is to sort the boarding passes so that you can keep away the used ones and have a neat stack of upcoming ones you could do an insertion sort by sorting the boarding passes according to datetime of departure you would need to take care of the time zones since the boarding passes usually only mention the local timesare you guys kidding you look at the date and time lolif you assume some efficiency in the routes  as in there isnt backtracking  you can analyze distances and positions of between the cities to map the full route that will give you the endpointsformapentry entry  mapentrysetinter­views  product manager– of  interview questionspreviousnextsee interview questions for
