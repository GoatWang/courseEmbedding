todd sparks  about  todd sparks about bios are boring most are selfcongratulatory patsonthe back of accomplishments that if youre famous everybody already knows and if youre not nobody cares the only importance of where we were is usually the fact that it defines where we will go ill use this space for that theme in the beginning family my family some of the funniest people in the world and great singers some not so great singers but it didnt stop them  which means none of my people are bashful i grew up with laughter and music my dad could deadpan a joke as well as anybody second was my uncle sam funny guys my maternal grandmother played the piano and sang to me when i was a kid and to this day ive never heard a better rendition of st louis blues her brother my greatuncle lynn mullinax was a celebrated pianist in manhattan for years all my cousins on my dads side had great voices and dance man we had great dancers my brother and sister could have been pros my favorite photograph is my mom and dad dancing in my grandmothers house while she plays the piano my home has always had music and laughter even during the bad times we laughed we sang so i get it naturally thats where this story begins in the beginning family my family some of the funniest people in the world and great singers some not so great singers but it didnt stop them  which means none of my people are bashful i grew up with laughter and music my dad could deadpan a joke as well as anybody second was my uncle sam funny guys my maternal grandmother played the piano and sang to me when i was a kid and to this day ive never heard a better rendition of st louis blues her brother my greatuncle lynn mullinax was a celebrated pianist in manhattan for years all my cousins on my dads side had great voices and dance man we had great dancers my brother and sister could have been pros my favorite photograph is my mom and dad dancing in my grandmothers house while she plays the piano my home has always had music and laughter even during the bad times we laughed we sang so i get it naturally thats where this story begins geography i was born in anniston alabama a great town in which to grow up it really was it had a little of everything it had an army base a four year college right up the road and the largest army depot in the free world when i was growing up it was an industrial town the worlds leading producer of soil pipe  look it up so a lot of people from all over the world would visit northeast alabama for a lot of reasons this made it a very cool place to play music anniston also had some of the meanest men  and women i have ever met fighters brawlers hard livin hard drinkin  hard workin types i knew many of these folks which of course made anniston a very cool place to write songs anniston was also the original home of the alabama shakespeare festival as well as a great honkytonk named elmers it had a very sophisticated well educated enclave of socialites and some of the smartest most intuitive good ol boys and girls i have ever met i went to school with rich kids poor kids black kids  after integration oriental kids and one american indian said he was anyway it was a town of dichotomy so it was a great place for artists and musicians to live to this day some of the greatest musicians i have ever heard play are from anniston and calhoun county alabama back porch pickers that can blow away many so called stars thats the first definition of my influences a meltingpot of personalities downhome sensibilities a wanderlust for sophistication and some of the best musicians never heard except by a lucky few the big move 9 it was time to get outta dodge i moved to panama city beach florida and met a guy named bill buskell he owned a beach bar restaurant named pineapple willys the first time i saw it i knew i wanted to play music there bill on the other hand was a bit skeptical but since i am a persistent fella with stalker tendencies after a couple of months of hounding him and to give himself some peace he gave me a shot june  9 i opened at pineapple willys and it has defined my life since that opening chord see even i am getting sentimental and the patontheback crap i said i wouldnt do anyway long story short  i know too late bill after getting to know me thought i would make a pretty good comedian my all music show evolved into a comedymusic show after much soul searching  about an hours worth i named my act the party doctor shout out to bob preston and tyler smith they actually came up with the name i sat in an antique optometrists chair  most folks thought it was a barbers chair or dentists chair  it wasnt dressed in scrubs and a lab coat and basically had a great time for a long time i can never thank bill buskell enough he is the smartest nicest guy i have ever known he taught me how to think outside the box and to act on my intuitions thats the main thing do it and believe me i did had to take a break for an important segue in  my son grant was born from the first minute i saw him i knew my lifes true purpose all the performing had a much more serious cause all the late nights had to end all the road dates had to stop they did i kept performing but in bands that played mainly for local corporate events and weddings great gigs fun met really great people it was just so very different from what i had been doing these shows took me out of the spotlight as well as the nightlife that was fine with me i needed to be home for my son but by being out of open to the public venues most folks thought i had retired believe me having a kid i was tired then retired every day but friends i wouldnt have changed a thing before i started this adventure and began putting an act back together he and i had a talk about it he supports me  so with my sons approval the time is right timing like i said earlier my mentor taught me to shut up and do it several things happened in  that got me to shut up and get back to it  panama city beach built and opened a new international airport and southwest airlines started service there bp had an accident in the gulf of mexico and really pissed me off but mainly the party doctor turned the big     all these things together with my sons blessing told me to quit talking about it and do it so i started writing songs the gulf coast had such a terrible string of bad luck  hurricanes floods drought tornados then an oil spill we needed a break so i wanted to celebrate this beautiful place where i lived i started a collaboration with a super talented super nice guy named tom hoots he and his partner calvin gann own studio  tom and i talked about what i wanted to do and how we should do it we started with a song for southwest airlines celebrating the fact of the company flying into our new airport we recorded it sent it to them and they liked it they allowed me and my band the shrimpboat cowboys to play for the opening of the airport and played the song southwest take me there on their website and blog for quite a while a very cool experience to say the least thats when tom and i decided to turn that one minisong into an album celebrating the positive aspects of where we live it took a while nearly a year to finish but we just did it an album we call the gulf of mexico everything thats old is new again so its time to get back out there putting on shows playing music trying to be funny mainly having a good time and hoping folks have a good time with me where ive been defines where i will go hopefully a little better a little wiser but still having a good timeread moreshorten biography microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser
