acrefoot and will largely depend upon the cost of power the project is expected to create approximately  direct and indirect jobs per year of construction and contribute over  million of new tax

science tweet the latest science ensuring that the project operates sustainably and responsibly is our top priority  beginning in  we invested in new science and technical work to evaluate the water resources at the project area and ensure that the project would be built and operated without harm to the surrounding environment over  months the internationally respected engineering firm chm hill conducted a comprehensive study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the aquifer system at the project area the study describes a system with a volume of water in storage comparable to lake mead the nation’s largest surface reservoir and a significant supply of annual recharge this and subsequent studies found that the aquifer system beneath our cadiz valley property consists principally of an alluvial carbonate and crystalline aquifer more specifically gravellike alluvium highly permeable dissolvedlimestone carbonate rock and fractured granitic metamorphic and volcanic crystalline rock the porous and cavernous nature of this rock contributes significantly to the productivity of the aquifer system chm hill’s analysis found  million acrefeet of water are in storage in the alluvium  acrefoot   gallons and subsequent study and analysis has shown that there could be an additional  million acrefeet coursing through the carbonate and crystalline rock layers chm hill’s study was peerreviewed by leading hydrology experts and the results were corroborated by extensive field research and pump testing major findings of the new studies include estimate of  million acrefeet of groundwater in alluvial aquifer system alone  additional studies show that there could be another  million acrefeet flowing through the carbonate and crystalline rock  acrefoot   gallons according to chm hill application of the latest  usgs computer model infil results in water recharge rate estimates of approximately  acrefeet per year character of the underlying carbonate and crystalline units greatly contributes to the productivity of the groundwater basin freshly collected field data corroborates watershed model results and significant recharging groundwater resource can be conserved so

project  about cadiz inc about cadiz inc home about cadiz inc   since it was founded in  cadiz inc has grown from a small california landowner into a noteworthy renewable resources company that leads a number of sustainable initiatives on more than  acres in california’s mojave desert using early satellite imagery at nasa the company’s founders identified an extensive aquifer system below the earth in a largely uninhabited part of eastern california over several years cadiz acquired small sections of land and through trades and exchanges with old railroad property and the federal government significantly expanded its holdings ultimately the company grew into one of the largest contiguous private landowners in california’s eastern mojave desert the company went on to initiate sustainable agriculture projects green energy and land preservation initiatives and the cadiz valley water conservation recovery and storage project known as the cadiz water project the company has focused the majority of its efforts on the cadiz water project which aims to avoid water waste and preserve as much as  million acrefeet of groundwater over its year term the project addresses water waste by working to prevent large quantities of groundwater from becoming highlysaline and evaporating when it migrates to dry lake playas in the area to conserve this water cadiz and its public agency partners developed a longterm and comprehensive groundwater management program that will recover  acrefeet of water less than  of the water in the system from the basin each year for  years the project will also enable participants to import and store surplus water in the groundwater basin for return when needed in future dry years by launching the water project cadiz will provide a reliable water source to southern california create jobs and provide numerous additional water supply benefits along with responsible stewardship of water resources the company practices organic farming and seeks to use its resources for land preservation and green energy generation the company’s sustainable projects are inspired by a green compact with the national heritage institute that emphasizes the importance of balancing resource management with land preservation efforts for example the cadiz water project will preserve habitats and desert ecology by installing pipeline alongside an active railroad track instead of on undisturbed lands and utilize the pipeline to generate new hydroelectric power to learn more visit wwwcadizinccom   recent news cadiz inc statement on california assembly
