story is thick with rich creamy flavor as elements are revealed tying in not only with the present but also the past the conclusion to the story is satisfying but one is left with any number of questions that may never be answered due to the plot intricacies developed through the film i really liked the portrayal of the powers that be in that they werent trying to cover up some big secret

possibilities presented with the alien object there is a real depth to this movie one that keeps drawing you deeper and deeper heaping implications on top of implications giving this viewer the sense that his mind was actually being blown the whole affair was very intelligent and well put together leading up to a very exciting climax i would recommend this to any fan of true science fiction as it

there was a problem loading comments right now please try again later out of  starsthe tv version was better but this is still a really good remakebyjero briggson april  format dvdverified purchasethe third installment in hammer films quatermass series and a remake of nigel kneales television serial originally aired on the bbc as i stated above this is a good movie remake its just that there is so much going on in the original sixpart tv version that its hard to fit everything into this minute movie and some of the good stuff in the tv version had to be left out of this theatrical version like for one example the underlined moral point of the story is lost in this version i also think the tv version was scarier more realistic and was better directed but this theatrical version is still worth getting mainly because its still really suspenseful its got pretty good special effects in it considering it was made back in  better special effects than in the tv version and it also gets you through the story a lot quicker and after all it does got the same good story that the original had in it and its written by the same person  the great nigel kneale i also think andrew keir makes an excellent quatermass ive been a fan of andrew keir ever since i seen him in the doctor who film daleks invasion earth  ad for info on the plot see my review for quatermass and the pit the classic  bbc

and i was around  at a drive in theater in pasadena texas my family would typically go to see double features and we kids would watch the kiddy feature early in the evening and theoreticly we were supposed to fall asleep before the adult movie came on well this is one that i managed to stay awake and quiet enough to watch when my parents thought i was asleep this movie seriously warped my brain

august  format dvdverified purchasethe first time i saw this movie was years ago late at night on television and it scared the well you know out of methe writing is superior and the acting is too when actors play a monster movie role as though they really believe it it comes out believable i like my monster movies to be played seriously unless its meant to be funny such as mib in that way you can escape into the movie and enjoy it morebecause its a dated movie if youve never seen it before watch it at night alone maybe with a candle on itll creep you out especially all the talk about hobbs

starsour ancestors were cockroachesbyj b hoyosvine voiceon july  format dvdverified purchasequatermass and the pit is the most exciting science fictionhorror hybrid ive seen from hammer productions the plot is intricate exciting and thought provoking it offers extremely unique theories of mans origin on earth professor quatermass andrew keir of dracula prince of darkness is investigating what first appears to be an unexploded bomb found during the construction of a subway line upon further examination he learns that it is an alien spacecraft that is over five million years old the identity of its crewmembers is quite disturbing worse of all the spacecraft appears to have a life of its own pandemonium breaks out in london as the spacecraft takes possession of mens bodies and souls turning them into killing machines that cant be stopped quatermass and the pit is a must have for everyone who owns a collection of science fiction andor hammer production classics i could not afford to purchase the one from anchor bay instead i bought the one released by optimum classic which is ntsc region  from britain the audio and video are great it is presented in widescreen the menu has a

comments right now please try again later out of  starshobbs endbyazon april  format dvdverified purchaseone of my favorite british scifi movies i wont repeat a synopsis of the story as others have done a very good job of that i will simply say that this movie seems to be a pivotal piece between the at times rank b style scifi movies of the s and a next step up to some more thoughtful and well thought out story and special effects it left me breathless at moments the first time i saw it i tend to be one of those guys who covers my eyes like a big kid at the scary parts and this one had me covered several times over anyway this is worth the money because it is very simply one of the best runs for our money that came along in a long time it was released initially titled  or  million years to earth which was quite disturbing when i went to look for that title finally i found it by accident in a dvd store with its correct british titleleave it the americans to screw up stuff that

viewer comments december    sharescomments explore more from this episode more james donald one of the producers of american eagle responds to some of your comments thank you for all of the comments so far – i’m touched to see how the film has affected people so deeply we’re happy that our story of the bald eagle was able to reach such a wide audience neil dreamt for years about making a bald eagle film so the broadcast of this show and your positive comments mean the world to him i’ve enjoyed reading your observations and look forward to corresponding with those who felt moved to write a comment on this website i wanted to answer some of the posted questions and to add feedback on some of the postings to date to answer ryan’s question the fish hatchery nest is situated in decorah ia the eagles live on private property though so no intruding  on a side note the oneeyed female once caught two trout with one foot she was a very impressive hunter when she needed to be our production team was very moved by path’s poem the section of the film involving the death of the oneeyed female and egg was by far one of the toughest scenes i’ve ever been a part of editing my wife was pregnant at the time neil rettig reported the deaths to us so i felt the loss on a deeper level than expected i was happy though that the male was able to rebuild his family during the next season and that we were able to capture his story for our film on the other american eagle comments page there have been some posts questioning the validity of the impact of ddt on bald eagle eggs this allows us to delve into the issue a bit further be assured our team thoroughly vetted all of our sources we were keenly aware of the dissenting opinions regarding the effects of ddt on bald eagles so we were especially careful and thorough with research on this point we reviewed a variety of reports published by wellrespected journals and took into consideration not only the information in the reports but also the sources they cited when considering the evidence appearing to indicate that ddt had little effect on bald eagles or their eggs the quality of the information or sources did not meet with our strict standards therefore we feel confident that our film’s comments about ddt are accurate i enjoyed looking at darlene’s photography — especially photos    the bald eagle’s wingspan is ridiculously large and those photos show it off quite well thank you for posting the link to your website there is nothing like being up close to a bald eagle although they are not half as scary in person as the harpy eagle — neil is the caretaker of one on loan from the peregrine fund to rechime the bell as rung by tom neil is the best raptor cinematographer i’ve ever worked with he spent almost two years filming this program and his meticulous attention to detail and his tireless work ethic comes across in the final product the quality of the footage is extraordinary considering too that bald eagles are shy by nature and do not like getting close to video cameras canon deserves a special shoutout for loaning us a x zoom lens with a builtin stabilizer every once in a while if you’re interested in
