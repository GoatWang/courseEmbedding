of the bible always beginning with a brief summary of the books setting and larger purpose this work is a onevolume abridgement of henrys greatest work so the text is less cumbersome than that of the original publication yet it might still require a little patience from the reader nevertheless using this commentary is well worth the effort and those who read its contents will not be disappointed

 stars out of  excellent introduction to matthew henry may   bob hayton st paul mn age  gender male perhaps no other pastor has bequeathed a greater treasure to the church than matthew henry and his commentary on the entire bible since  his commentary has blessed generations with a clear explanation and devotional treatment of scripture his work set the bar for future commentaries with its blend of accessibility practicality spiritual warmth and doctrinal depth it is truly a classic which should continue to endure for years to come charles spurgeon the great baptist preacher from the th century recommended that ministers read through henrys  volume commentary once a year few pastors today have done so many churchgoers today have an abridged henry on their shelf or access to his entire work in a bible study computer program or online but few of them have read significant portions of his work i must confess myself to be in the number of those who havent read enough of matthew henry randall peterson has offered a wonderful introduction to henrys writing through a selection of daily devotional readings excerpted from his commentary matthew henry daily readings is nicely published and presented in a leather bound conveniently sized edition complete with a ribbon bookmark like you would find in most bibles each reading includes the days date a title for the selection a scripture verse from the esv and at the bottom of the page the section of henrys commentary where the selection is to be found selections cover the wide range of the bible with a special emphasis on psalms henry has a firm grasp of the gospel and will not lead the believer wrong an excerpt from his may st entry illustrates how challenging this devotional can be we know not his riches and our own poverty therefore we run not to him we perceive not that we are lost and perishing therefore a savior is a word of little relish were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us and the wrath that hangs over us for it ready to fall upon us it would be our continual thought is the savior mine and that we might find him so we should trample on all that hinders our way to him this devotional will not be as easy to read as our daily bread but its nutritional content will be a balm to your soul i highly recommend this excellent work which is suitable for a special gift or a

miles to their episcopal church every sunday ford was devastated when his mother died in  his father expected him to eventually take over the family farm but he despised farm work he later wrote i never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm i loved in  ford left home to work as an apprentice machinist in detroit first with james f flower  bros and later with the detroit dry dock co in  he returned to dearborn to work on the family farm where he became adept at operating the westinghouse portable steam engine he was later hired by westinghouse to service their steam engines during this period ford also studied bookkeeping at goldsmith bryant  stratton business college in detroit marriage and family henry ford in  aged  ford married clara jane bryant – on april   and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill they had one child edsel ford – career in  ford became an engineer with the edison illuminating company after his promotion to chief engineer in  he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines these experiments culminated in  with the completion of a selfpropelled vehicle which he named the ford quadricycle he testdrove it on june  after various test drives ford brainstormed ways to improve the quadricycle also in  ford attended a meeting of edison executives where he was introduced to thomas edison edison approved of fords automobile experimentation encouraged by edison ford designed and built a second vehicle completing it in  backed by the capital of detroit lumber baron william h murphy ford resigned from the edison company and founded the detroit automobile company on august   however the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than ford wanted ultimately the company was not successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing his name with ford gone murphy renamed the company the cadillac automobile company teaming up with former racing cyclist tom cooper ford also produced the  horsepower racer  which barney oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were slow and a crisis arose when the dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment ford motor company henry ford with thomas edison and harvey firestone fort myers florida february   in response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june   with  capital the original investors included ford and malcomson the dodge brothers malcomsons uncle john s gray malcolmsons secretary james couzens and two of malcomsons lawyers john w anderson and horace rackham ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of lake st clair driving  mile  km in  seconds and setting a new land speed record at  miles per hour  kilometres per hour convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of vsnkh valery i mezhlauk and the president of amtorg saul g bron an additional contract for actual construction of the plant was signed with the austin company on august   the contract involved the purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous subsidiaries that sold or assembled the ford cars and trucks ford of australia ford of britain ford of argentina ford of brazil ford of canada ford of europe ford india ford south africa ford mexico ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in september  and went into retirement he died on april   of a cerebral hemorrhage at fair lane his estate in dearborn at the age of  a public viewing was held at greenfield village where up to  people per hour filed past the casket funeral services were held in detroits cathedral church of st paul and he was buried in the ford cemetery in detroit personal interests a compendium of short biographies of famous freemasons published by a freemason lodge lists ford as a member the grand lodge of new york confirms that ford was a freemason and was raised in palestine lodge no  detroit in  when he received his rd in  he said masonry is the best balance wheel the united states has in  fords pastor and head of his sociology department episcopal minister samuel s marquis claimed that ford believed or once believed in reincarnation ford published an antismoking book circulated to youth in  called the case against the little white slaver which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries at the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment so fords opposition to cigarettes was unusual interest in materials science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic research corp in fort myers florida to look for a native source of rubber ford was a prolific inventor and was awarded  us patents florida and georgia residences and community ford had a vacation residence in fort myers florida next to that of thomas edison which he bought in  and used until approximately  it is still in existence today and is open as a museum he also had a vacation home known today as the ford plantation in richmond hill georgia which is still in existence today as a private community ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned  acres  square miles there in  ford broke ground for a beautiful greek revival style mansion on the banks of the ogeechee river on the site of a s plantation the grand house made of savannahgray brick had marble steps air conditioning and an elevator it sat on  acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens the house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the vanderbilts rockefellers and the duponts it remains the centerpiece of the ford plantation today ford converted the s–era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home providing it with steam he contributed substantially to the community building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents preserving americana ford had an interest in americana in the s ford began work to turn sudbury massachusetts into a themed historical village he moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme mary had a little lamb from sterling massachusetts and purchased the historic wayside inn this plan never saw fruition ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of greenfield village in dearborn michigan it may have inspired the creation of old sturbridge village as well about the same time he began collecting materials for his museum which had a theme of practical technology it was opened in  as the edison institute although greatly modernized the museum continues today in popular culture mr and

dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times gaining the reputation of a watch repairman at twenty ford walked four miles to their episcopal church every sunday ford was devastated when his mother died in  his father expected him to eventually take over the family farm but he despised farm work he later wrote i never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm i loved in  ford left home to work as an apprentice machinist in detroit first with james f flower  bros and later with the detroit dry dock co in  he returned to dearborn to work on the family farm where he became adept at operating the westinghouse portable steam engine he was later hired by westinghouse to service their steam engines during this period ford also studied bookkeeping at goldsmith bryant  stratton business college in detroit marriage and family henry ford in  aged  ford married clara jane bryant – on april   and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill they had one child edsel ford – career in  ford became an engineer with the edison illuminating company after his promotion to chief engineer in  he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines these experiments culminated in  with the completion of a selfpropelled vehicle which he named the ford quadricycle he testdrove it on june  after various test drives ford brainstormed ways to improve the quadricycle also in  ford attended a meeting of edison executives where he was introduced to thomas edison edison approved of fords automobile experimentation encouraged by edison ford designed and built a second vehicle completing it in  backed by the capital of detroit lumber baron william h murphy ford resigned from the edison company and founded the detroit automobile company on august   however the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than ford wanted ultimately the company was not successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing his name with ford gone murphy renamed the company the cadillac automobile company teaming up with former racing cyclist tom cooper ford also produced the  horsepower racer  which barney oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were slow and a crisis arose when the dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment ford motor company henry ford with thomas edison and harvey firestone fort myers florida february   in response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june   with  capital the original investors included ford and malcomson the dodge brothers malcomsons uncle john s gray malcolmsons secretary james couzens and two of malcomsons lawyers john w anderson and horace rackham ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of lake st clair driving  mile  km in  seconds and setting a new land speed record at  miles per hour  kilometres per hour convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of vsnkh valery i mezhlauk and the president of amtorg saul g bron an additional contract for actual construction of the plant was signed with the austin company on august   the contract involved the purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous subsidiaries that sold or assembled the ford cars and trucks ford of australia ford of britain ford of argentina ford of brazil ford of canada ford of europe ford india ford south africa ford mexico ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in september  and went into retirement he died on april   of a cerebral hemorrhage at fair lane his estate in dearborn at the age of  a public viewing was held at greenfield village where up to  people per hour filed past the casket funeral services were held in detroits cathedral church of st paul and he was buried in the ford cemetery in detroit personal interests a compendium of short biographies of famous freemasons published by a freemason lodge lists ford as a member the grand lodge of new york confirms that ford was a freemason and was raised in palestine lodge no  detroit in  when he received his rd in  he said masonry is the best balance wheel the united states has in  fords pastor and head of his sociology department episcopal minister samuel s marquis claimed that ford believed or once believed in reincarnation ford published an antismoking book circulated to youth in  called the case against the little white slaver which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries at the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment so fords opposition to cigarettes was unusual interest in materials science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic research corp in fort myers florida to look for a native source of rubber ford was a prolific inventor and was awarded  us patents florida and georgia residences and community ford had a vacation residence in fort myers florida next to that of thomas edison which he bought in  and used until approximately  it is still in existence today and is open as a museum he also had a vacation home known today as the ford plantation in richmond hill georgia which is still in existence today as a private community ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned  acres  square miles there in  ford broke ground for a beautiful greek revival style mansion on the banks of the ogeechee river on the site of a s plantation the grand house made of savannahgray brick had marble steps air conditioning and an elevator it sat on  acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens the house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the vanderbilts rockefellers and the duponts it remains the centerpiece of the ford plantation today ford converted the s–era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home providing it with steam he contributed substantially to the community building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents preserving americana ford had an interest in americana in the s ford began work to turn sudbury massachusetts into a themed historical village he moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme mary had a little lamb from sterling massachusetts and purchased the historic wayside inn this plan never saw fruition ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of greenfield village in dearborn michigan it may have inspired the creation of old sturbridge village as well about the same time he began collecting materials for his museum which had a theme of practical technology it was opened in  as the edison institute although greatly modernized the museum continues today in popular culture mr and mrs henry ford in his first car the ford quadricycle in aldous huxleys brave new

june  after various test drives ford brainstormed ways to improve the quadricycle also in  ford attended a meeting of edison executives where he was introduced to thomas edison edison approved of fords automobile experimentation encouraged by edison ford designed and built a second vehicle completing it in  backed by the capital of detroit lumber baron william h murphy ford resigned from the edison company and founded the detroit automobile company on august   however the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than ford wanted ultimately the company was not successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing his name with ford gone murphy renamed the company the cadillac automobile company teaming up with former racing cyclist tom cooper ford also produced the  horsepower racer  which barney oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were slow and a crisis arose when the dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment ford motor company henry ford with thomas edison and harvey firestone fort myers florida february   in response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june   with  capital the original investors included ford and malcomson the dodge brothers malcomsons uncle john s gray malcolmsons secretary james couzens and two of malcomsons lawyers john w anderson and horace rackham ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of lake st clair driving  mile  km in  seconds and setting a new land speed record at  miles per hour  kilometres per hour convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of

purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous

ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in

science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic

successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing his name with ford gone murphy renamed the company the cadillac automobile company teaming up with former racing cyclist tom cooper ford also produced the  horsepower racer  which barney oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were slow and a crisis arose when the dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment ford motor company henry ford with thomas edison and harvey firestone fort myers florida february   in response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june

convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of

purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous

ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in

science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic research corp in fort myers florida to look for a native source of rubber ford was a prolific inventor and was awarded  us patents florida and georgia residences and community ford had a vacation residence in fort myers florida next to that of thomas edison which he bought in  and used until approximately  it is still in existence today and is open as a museum he also had a vacation home known today as the ford plantation in richmond hill georgia which is still in existence today as a private community ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned  acres  square miles there in  ford broke ground for a beautiful greek revival style mansion on the banks of the ogeechee river on the site of a s plantation the grand house made of savannahgray brick had marble steps air conditioning and an elevator it sat on  acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens the house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the vanderbilts rockefellers and the duponts it remains the centerpiece of the ford plantation today ford converted the s–era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home providing it with steam he contributed substantially to the community building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents preserving americana ford had an interest in americana in the s ford began work to turn sudbury massachusetts into a themed historical village he moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme mary had a little lamb from sterling massachusetts and purchased the historic wayside inn this plan never saw fruition ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of greenfield village in dearborn michigan it may have inspired the creation of old sturbridge village as well about the same time he began collecting materials for his museum which had a theme of practical technology it was

fords automobile experimentation encouraged by edison ford designed and built a second vehicle completing it in  backed by the capital of detroit lumber baron william h murphy ford resigned from the

successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing

to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were

response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june   with  capital the original investors included ford and malcomson the dodge brothers malcomsons uncle john s gray malcolmsons secretary james couzens and two of malcomsons lawyers john w anderson and horace rackham ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of lake st clair driving  mile  km in  seconds and setting a new land speed record at  miles per hour  kilometres per hour convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of vsnkh valery i mezhlauk and the president of amtorg saul g bron an additional contract for actual construction of the plant was signed with the austin company on august   the contract involved the purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous subsidiaries that sold or assembled the ford cars and trucks ford of australia ford of britain ford of argentina ford of brazil ford of canada ford of europe ford india ford south africa ford mexico ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in september  and went into retirement he died on april   of a cerebral hemorrhage at fair lane his estate in dearborn at the age of  a public viewing was held at greenfield village where up to  people

to by many researchers and luminaries at the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment so fords opposition to cigarettes was unusual interest in materials science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic research corp in fort myers florida to look for a native source of rubber ford was a prolific inventor and was awarded  us patents florida and georgia residences and community ford had a vacation residence in fort myers florida next to that of thomas edison which he bought in  and used until approximately  it is still in existence today and is open as a museum he also had a vacation home known today as the ford plantation in richmond hill georgia which is still in existence today as a private community ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned  acres  square miles there in  ford broke ground for a beautiful greek revival style mansion on the banks of the ogeechee river on the site of a s plantation the grand house made of savannahgray brick had marble steps air conditioning and an elevator it sat on  acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens the house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the vanderbilts rockefellers and the duponts it remains the centerpiece of the ford plantation today ford converted the s–era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home providing it with steam he contributed substantially to the community building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents preserving americana ford had an interest in americana in the s ford began work to turn sudbury massachusetts into a themed historical village he moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme mary had a little lamb from sterling massachusetts and purchased the historic wayside inn this plan never saw fruition ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of greenfield village in dearborn michigan it may have inspired the creation of old sturbridge village as well about the same time he began collecting materials for his museum which had a theme of practical technology it was opened in  as the edison institute although greatly modernized the museum continues today in popular culture mr and mrs henry ford in his first car the ford quadricycle in aldous huxleys brave new

dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times gaining the reputation of a watch repairman at twenty ford walked four miles to their episcopal church every sunday ford was devastated when his mother died in  his father expected him to eventually take over the family farm but he despised farm work he later wrote i never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm i loved in  ford left home to work as an apprentice machinist in detroit first with james f flower  bros and later with the detroit dry dock co in  he returned to dearborn to work on the family farm where he became adept at operating the westinghouse portable steam engine he was later hired by westinghouse to service their steam engines during this period ford also studied bookkeeping at goldsmith bryant  stratton business college in detroit marriage and family henry ford in  aged  ford married clara jane bryant – on april   and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill they had one child edsel ford – career in  ford became an engineer with the edison illuminating company after his promotion to chief engineer in  he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines these experiments culminated in  with the completion of a selfpropelled vehicle which he named the ford quadricycle he testdrove it on june  after various test drives ford brainstormed ways to improve the quadricycle also in  ford attended a meeting of edison executives where he was introduced to thomas edison edison approved of fords automobile experimentation encouraged by edison ford designed and built a second vehicle completing it in  backed by the capital of detroit lumber baron william h murphy ford resigned from the edison company and founded the detroit automobile company on august   however the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than ford wanted ultimately the company was not successful and was dissolved in january  with the help of c harold wills ford designed built and successfully raced a horsepower automobile in october  with this success murphy and other stockholders in the detroit automobile company formed the henry ford company on november   with ford as chief engineer in  murphy brought in henry m leland as a consultant ford in response left the company bearing his name with ford gone murphy renamed the company the cadillac automobile company teaming up with former racing cyclist tom cooper ford also produced the  horsepower racer  which barney oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in october  ford received the backing of an old acquaintance alexander y malcomson a detroitarea coal dealer they formed a partnership ford  malcomson ltd to manufacture automobiles ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by john and horace e dodge to supply over  in parts sales were slow and a crisis arose when the dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment ford motor company henry ford with thomas edison and harvey firestone fort myers florida february   in response malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company ford  malcomson was reincorporated as the ford motor company on june   with  capital the original investors included ford and malcomson the dodge brothers malcomsons uncle john s gray malcolmsons secretary james couzens and two of malcomsons lawyers john w anderson and horace rackham ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of lake st clair driving  mile  km in  seconds and setting a new land speed record at  miles per hour  kilometres per hour convinced by this success the race driver barney oldfield who named this new ford model  in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day took the car around the country making the ford brand known throughout the united states ford also was one of the early backers of the indianapolis  model t the model t was introduced on october   it had the steering wheel on the left which every other company soon copied the entire engine and transmission were enclosed the four cylinders were cast in a solid block the suspension used two semielliptic springs the car was very simple to drive and easy and cheap to repair it was so cheap at  in   today the price fell every year that by the s a majority of american drivers had learned to drive on the model t ford created a huge publicity machine in detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product fords network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in north america as independent dealers the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the ford but the concept of automobiling local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside ford was always eager to sell to farmers who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business sales skyrocketed—several years posted  gains on the previous year always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs in  ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants which enabled an enormous increase in production although ford is often credited with the idea contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees clarence avery peter e martin charles e sorensen and c harold wills see ford piquette avenue plant ford assembly line  sales passed  in  by  as the price dropped to  for the basic touring car sales reached  using the consumer price index this price was equivalent to  in  dollars a  ford t roadster on display in india by  half of all cars in america were model ts all new cars were black as ford wrote in his autobiography any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black until the development of the assembly line which mandated black because of its quicker drying time model ts were available in other colors including red the design was fervently promoted and defended by ford and production continued as late as  the final total production was  this record stood for the next  years this record was achieved in  years from the introduction of the first model t  president woodrow wilson asked ford to run as a democrat for the united states senate from michigan in  although the nation was at war ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed league of nations ford was defeated in a close election by the republican candidate truman newberry a former united states secretary of the navy henry ford turned the presidency of ford motor company over to his son edsel ford in december  henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son ford started another company henry ford and son and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the ford motor company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value he was determined to have full control over strategic decisions the ruse worked and ford and edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors thus giving the family sole ownership of the company by the mids sales of the model t began to decline due to rising competition other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the model t despite urgings from edsel henry refused to incorporate new features into the model t or to form a customer credit plan model a and fords later career by  flagging sales of the model t finally convinced ford to make a new model he pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine chassis and other mechanical necessities while leaving the body design to his son edsel also managed to prevail over his fathers initial objections in the inclusion of a slidingshift transmission the result was the successful ford model a introduced in december  and produced through  with a total output of more than  million subsequently the ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor general motors and still in use by automakers today not until the s did ford overcome his objection to finance companies and the fordowned universal credit corporation became a major carfinancing operation ford did not believe in accountants he amassed one of the worlds largest fortunes without ever having his company audited under his administration labor philosophy the fivedollar wage time magazine january   ford was a pioneer of welfare capitalism designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring  men per year to fill  slots efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers ford astonished the world in  by offering a  per day wage  today which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers a cleveland ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression the move proved extremely profitable instead of constant turnover of employees the best mechanics in detroit flocked to ford bringing their human capital and expertise raising productivity and lowering training costs ford announced his perday program on january   raising the minimum daily pay from  to  for qualifying male workers detroit was already a highwage city but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers fords policy proved however that paying people more would enable ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy he viewed the increased wages as profitsharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character it may have been couzens who convinced ford to adopt the day wage real profitsharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more and importantly conducted their lives in a manner of which fords social department approved they frowned on heavy drinking gambling and what today are called deadbeat dads the social department used  investigators plus support staff to maintain employee standards a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this profitsharingcitation needed fords incursion into his employees private lives was highly controversial and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects by the time he wrote his  memoir he spoke of the social department and of the private conditions for profitsharing in the past tense and admitted that paternalism has no place in industry welfare work that consists in prying into employees private concerns is out of date men need counsel and men need help often special help and all this ought to be rendered for decencys sake but the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment the fiveday workweek in addition to raising the wages of his workers ford also introduced a new reduced workweek in  the decision was made in  when ford and crowther described it as six hour days giving a hour week but in  it was announced as five hour days giving a hour week apparently the program started with saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off on may   the ford motor companys factory workers switched to a fiveday hour workweek with the companys office workers making the transition the following august ford had made the decision to boost productivity as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods however altruistic concerns also played a role with ford explaining it is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege labor unions ford was adamantly against labor unions he explained his views on unions in chapter  of my life and work he thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who despite their ostensible good motives would end up doing more harm than good for workers most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment but ford saw this as selfdefeating because in his view productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist he believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere whether within the same corporation or in others ford also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socioeconomic crisis as a way to maintain their own power meanwhile he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers because doing so would maximize their own profits ford did acknowledge however that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact but ford believed that eventually if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right ie both socialists and badmanager reactionaries the good managers would create a socioeconomic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing to forestall union activity ford promoted harry bennett a former navy boxer to head the service department bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing the most famous incident on may   involved bennetts security men beating with clubs uaw representatives including walter reuther while bennetts men were beating the uaw representatives the supervising police chief on the scene was carl brooks an alumnus of bennett’s service department and brooks did not give orders to intervene the incident became known as the battle of the overpass in the late s and early s edsel—who was president of the company—thought ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence work disruptions and bitter stalemates could not go on forever but ford who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one refused to cooperate for several years he kept bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the ford motor company sorensens memoir makes clear that fords purpose in putting bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached the ford motor company was the last detroit automaker to recognize the united auto workers union uaw a sitdown strike by the uaw union in april  closed the river rouge plant sorensen recounted that a distraught henry ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but his wife clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business in her view it would not be worth the chaos it would create ford complied with his wifes ultimatum and even agreed with her in retrospect overnight the ford motor company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable uaw contract terms the contract was signed in june  ford airplane company ford like other automobile companies entered the aviation business during world war i building liberty engines after the war it returned to auto manufacturing until  when ford acquired the stout metal airplane company ford atf ecrra of the spanish republican airline lape fords most successful aircraft was the ford at trimotor often called the tin goose because of its corrugated metal construction it used a new alloy called alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin the plane was similar to fokkers vviim and some say that fords engineers surreptitiously measured the fokker plane and then copied it the trimotor first flew on june   and was the first successful us passenger airliner accommodating about  passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion several variants were also used by the us army ford has been honored by the smithsonian institution for changing the aviation industry  trimotors were built before it was discontinued in  when the ford airplane division shut down because of poor sales during the great depression willow run main article willow run peace and war world war i era ford opposed war which he viewed as a terrible waste ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war and he tried to stop them in  the pacifist rosika schwimmer gained favor with ford who agreed to fund a peace ship to europe where world war i was raging he and about  other prominent peace leaders traveled there fords episcopalian pastor reverend samuel s marquis accompanied him on the mission marquis headed fords sociology department from  to  ford talked to president wilson about the mission but had no government support his group went to neutral sweden and the netherlands to meet with peace activists a target of much ridicule ford left the ship as soon as it reached sweden ford plants in the united kingdom produced tractors to increase the british food supply as well as trucks and aircraft engines when the us entered the war in  the company became a major supplier of weapons especially the liberty engine for airplanes and antisubmarine boats in  with the war on and the league of nations a growing issue in global politics president woodrow wilson a democrat encouraged ford to run for a michigan seat in the us senate wilson believed that ford could tip the scales in congress in favor of wilsons proposed league you are the only man in michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire the president wrote ford ford wrote back if they want to elect me let them do so but i wont make a pennys investment ford did run however and came within  votes of winning out of more than  cast statewide ford remained a staunch wilsonian and supporter of the league when wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of  to promote the league ford helped fund the attendant publicity the coming of world war ii and fords mental collapse ford had opposed americas entry into world war ii and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars ford insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction in  he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of us merchant ships by german submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier warmakers the financiers to whom he was referring was fords code for jews he had also accused jews of fomenting the first world war in the runup to world war ii and when the war erupted in  he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents like many other businessmen of the great depression era he never liked or entirely trusted the franklin roosevelt administration and thought roosevelt was inching the us closer to war however ford continued to do business with nazi germany including the manufacture of war materiel beginning in  with the requisitioning of between  and  french pows to work as slave laborers fordwerke contravened article  of the  geneva convention at that time which was before the us entered the war and still had full diplomatic relations with nazi germany fordwerke was under the control of the ford motor company the number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although wallace makes it clear that companies in germany were not required by the nazi authorities to use slave laborerscitation needed when rollsroyce sought a us manufacturer as an alternative source for the merlin engine as fitted to spitfire and hurricane fighters ford first agreed to do so and then reneged he lined up behind the war effort when the us entered in late  his support of the american war effort however was problematic once the us entered the war ford directed the ford motor company to construct a vast new purposebuilt factory at willow run near detroit michigan ford broke ground on willow run in the spring of  and the first b came off the line in october  at  sq ft  m it was the largest assembly line in the world at the time at its peak in  the willow run plant produced  bs per month and by  ford was completing each b in eighteen hours with one rolling off the assembly line every  minutes ford produced  bs at willow run half of the  total bs produced during the war when edsel ford died prematurely in  henry ford nominally resumed control of the company but a series of strokes in the late s had left him increasingly debilitated and his mental ability was fading ford was increasingly sidelined and others made decisions in his name the company was in fact controlled by a handful of senior executives led by charles sorensen an important engineer and production executive at ford and harry bennett the chief of fords service unit fords paramilitary force that spied on and enforced discipline upon ford employees ford grew jealous of the publicity sorensen received and forced sorensen out in  fords incompetence led to discussions in washington about how to restore the company whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors nothing happened until  when with bankruptcy a serious risk edsels widow led an ouster and installed her son henry ford ii as presidentbetter source needed the young man took full control and forced out harry bennett in a purge of the old guard in  the dearborn independent and antisemitism main article dearborn independent the ford publication the international jew the worlds foremost problem articles from the dearborn independent  in the early s ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views at the same time ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers and was not accused of discrimination against jewish workers or suppliers he also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon in  fords closest aide and private secretary ernest g liebold purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for ford the dearborn independent the independent ran for eight years from  until  with liebold as editor every ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers during this period ford emerged as a respected spokesman for rightwing extremism and religious prejudice reaching around  readers through his newspaper the  documentary film jews and baseball an american love story written by pulitzer prize winner ira berkow states that ford wrote on may   if fans wish to know the trouble with american baseball they have it in three words—too much jew in germany fords antisemitic articles from the dearborn independent were issued in four volumes cumulatively titled the international jew the worlds foremost problem published by theodor fritsch founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the reichstag in a letter written in  heinrich himmler described ford as one of our most valuable important and witty fighters ford is the only american mentioned favorably in mein kampf although he is only mentioned once adolf hitler wrote only a single great man ford who to the jews fury still maintains full independencefrom the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions speaking in  to a detroit news reporter hitler said he regarded ford as his inspiration explaining his reason for keeping fords lifesize portrait next to his desk steven watts wrote that hitler revered ford proclaiming that i shall do my best to put his theories into practice in germany and modeling the volkswagen the peoples car on the model t however max wallace has stated history records thatadolf hitler was an ardent antisemite before he ever read fords the international jew grand cross of the german eagle an award bestowed on ford by nazi germany on february   ford received kurt ludecke a representative of hitler at home ludecke was introduced to ford by siegfried wagner son of the composer richard wagner and his wife winifred both nazi sympathizers and antisemites ludecke asked ford for a contribution to the nazi cause but was apparently refused while fords articles were denounced by the antidefamation league adl the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against jews but blamed the jews for provoking incidents of mass violence none of this work was written by ford but he allowed his name to be used as author according to trial testimony he wrote almost nothing friends and business associates have said they warned ford about the contents of the independent and that he probably never read the articles he claimed he only read the headlines however court testimony in a libel suit brought by one of the targets of the newspaper alleged that ford did know about the contents of the independent in advance of publication a libel lawsuit was brought by san francisco lawyer and jewish farm cooperative organizer aaron sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks and led ford to close the independent in december  news reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature during the trial the editor of fords own page william cameron testified that ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to ford for his approval investigative journalist max wallace noted that whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when james m miller a former dearborn independent employee swore under oath that ford had told him he intended to expose sapiro michael barkun observed that cameron would have continued to publish such antisemitic material without fords explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men mrs stanley ruddiman a ford family intimate remarked that i dont think mr cameron ever wrote anything for publication without mr fords approval according to spencer blakeslee the adl mobilized prominent jews and nonjews to publicly oppose fords message they formed a coalition of jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the detroit press before leaving his presidency early in  woodrow wilson joined other leading americans in a statement that rebuked ford and others for their antisemitic campaign a boycott against ford products by jews and liberal christians also had an impact and ford shut down the paper in  recanting his views in a public letter to sigmund livingston adl wallace also found that fords apology was likely at least partly motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of ford cars up until the apology a considerable number of dealers who had been required to make sure that buyers of ford cars received the independent bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers fords  apology was well received fourfifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to ford in july  were from jews and almost without exception they praised the industrialist in january  a ford statement to the detroit jewish chronicle disavowed any connection whatsoever with the publication in germany of a book known as the international jew according to pool and pool  fords retraction and apology which were written by others were not even truly signed by him rather his signature was forged by harry bennett and ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views stating in  i hope to republish the international jew again some time in july  before the outbreak of war the german consul at cleveland gave ford on his th birthday the award of the grand cross of the german eagle the highest medal nazi germany could bestow on a foreigner james d mooney vicepresident of overseas operations for general motors received a similar medal the merit cross of the german eagle first class on january   ford wrote a letter to sigmund livingston as the founder and national chairman of the antidefamation league the purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or supported directly or indirectly “any agitation which would promote antagonism toward my jewish fellow citizens” he concluded the letter with “my sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished hatred of the jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time” distribution of the international jew was halted in  through legal action by ford despite complications from a lack of copyright it is still banned in germany extremist groups often recycle the material it still appears on antisemitic and neonazi websites testifying at nuremberg convicted hitler youth leader baldur von schirach who in his role as military governor of vienna deported  jews to camps in poland stated the decisive antisemitic book i was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was  that book by henry ford the international jew i read it and became antisemitic the book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in henry ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy robert lacey wrote in ford the men and the machines that a close willow run associate of ford reported that when he was shown newsreel footage of the nazi concentration camps he was confronted with the atrocities which finally and unanswerably laid bare the bestiality of the prejudice to which he contributed he collapsed with a stroke – his last and most serious ford had suffered previous strokes and his final cerebral hemorrhage occurred in  at age  international business fords philosophy was one of economic independence for the united states his river rouge plant became the worlds largest industrial complex pursuing vertical integration to such an extent that it could produce its own steel fords goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade he believed in the global expansion of his company he believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace and he used the assembly line process and production of the model t to demonstrate it he opened ford assembly plants in britain and canada in  and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries in  ford cooperated with giovanni agnelli of fiat to launch the first italian automotive assembly plants the first plants in germany were built in the s with the encouragement of herbert hoover and the commerce department which agreed with fords theory that international trade was essential to world peace in the s ford also opened plants in australia india and france and by  he had successful dealerships on six continents ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the amazon jungle called fordlândia it was one of his few failures after signing contract for technical assistance in building nizhny novgorod gorky automobile plant dearborn mich may   left to right valery i mezhlauk vice chairman of vsnkh henry ford saul g bron president of amtorg in  in the absence of diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union ford accepted an offer by the soviet government to provide technical aid in building the first soviet automobile plant gaz near nizhny novgorod gorky the technical assistance agreement between the ford motor company vsnkh and amtorg as purchasing agent was concluded for nine years and was signed in dearborn on may   by henry ford vicepresident of the ford motor company peter e martin vicechairman of vsnkh valery i mezhlauk and the president of amtorg saul g bron an additional contract for actual construction of the plant was signed with the austin company on august   the contract involved the purchase of  worth of knockeddown ford cars and trucks for assembly during the first four years of the plant’s operation after which the plant would gradually switch to sovietmade components ford sent his engineers and technicians to the soviet union to help install the equipment and train the working force while over a hundred soviet engineers and technicians were stationed at ford’s plants in detroit and dearborn “for the purpose of learning the methods and practice of manufacture and assembly in the companys plants” said ford “no matter where industry prospers whether in india or china or russia the more profit there will be for everyone including us all the world is bound to catch some good from it” by  ford was manufacturing one third of all the worlds automobiles it set up numerous subsidiaries that sold or assembled the ford cars and trucks ford of australia ford of britain ford of argentina ford of brazil ford of canada ford of europe ford india ford south africa ford mexico ford philippines henry ford in germany september  fords image transfixed europeans especially the germans arousing the fear of some the infatuation of others and the fascination among all germans who discussed fordism often believed that it represented something quintessentially american they saw the size tempo standardization and philosophy of production demonstrated at the ford works as a national service—an american thing that represented the culture of the united states both supporters and critics insisted that fordism epitomized american capitalist development and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the united states as one german explained automobiles have so completely changed the americans mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car it is difficult to remember what life was like before mr ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation for many germans ford embodied the essence of successful americanism in my life and work ford predicted that if greed racism and shortsightedness could be overcome then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on what today would be called colonial or neocolonial models and would truly benefit all peoples his ideas in this passage were vague but they were idealistic racing ford standing launched barney oldfields career in  ford maintained an interest in auto racing from  to  and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver later turning the wheel over to hired drivers he entered strippeddown model ts in races finishing first although later disqualified in an oceantoocean across the united states race in  and setting a onemile  km oval speed record at detroit fairgrounds in  with driver frank kulick in  ford attempted to enter a reworked model t in the indianapolis  but was told rules required the addition of another  pounds  kg to the car before it could qualify ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently citing dissatisfaction with the sports rules demands on his time by the booming production of the model ts and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity in my life and work ford speaks briefly of racing in a rather dismissive tone as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general he describes himself as someone who raced only because in the s through s one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile ford did not agree but he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success flawed though the definition was then his cars would be the best that there were at racing throughout the book he continually returns to ideals such as transportation production efficiency affordability reliability fuel efficiency economic prosperity and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry but rarely mentions and rather belittles the idea of merely going fast from point a to point b nevertheless ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years and he was inducted into the motorsports hall of fame of america in  later career and death when edsel ford president of ford motor company died of cancer in may  the elderly and ailing henry ford decided to assume the presidency by this point in his life he had had several cardiovascular events variously cited as heart attacks or strokes and was mentally inconsistent suspicious and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities most of the directors did not want to see him as president but for the previous  years though he had long been without any official executive title he had always had de facto control over the company the board and the management had never seriously defied him and this moment was not different the directors elected him and he served until the end of the war during this period the company began to decline losing more than  million a month  today the administration of president franklin roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production but the idea never progressed ford grave ford cemetery his health failing ford ceded the company presidency to his grandson henry ford ii in september  and went into retirement he died on april   of a cerebral hemorrhage at fair lane his estate in dearborn at the age of  a public viewing was held at greenfield village where up to  people per hour filed past the casket funeral services were held in detroits cathedral church of st paul and he was buried in the ford cemetery in detroit personal interests a compendium of short biographies of famous freemasons published by a freemason lodge lists ford as a member the grand lodge of new york confirms that ford was a freemason and was raised in palestine lodge no  detroit in  when he received his rd in  he said masonry is the best balance wheel the united states has in  fords pastor and head of his sociology department episcopal minister samuel s marquis claimed that ford believed or once believed in reincarnation ford published an antismoking book circulated to youth in  called the case against the little white slaver which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries at the time smoking was ubiquitous and was not yet widely associated with health detriment so fords opposition to cigarettes was unusual interest in materials science and engineering henry ford long had an interest in materials science and engineering he enthusiastically described his companys adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic rd work ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products especially soybeans he cultivated a relationship with george washington carver for this purposecitation needed soybeanbased plastics were used in ford automobiles throughout the s in plastic parts such as car horns in paint etc this project culminated in  when ford patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic attached to a tubular welded frame it weighed  less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel furthermore it ran on grain alcohol ethanol instead of gasoline the design never caught on ford was interested in engineered woods better wood can be made than is grown at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas corn as a fuel source via both corn oil and ethanol and the potential uses of cotton ford was instrumental in developing charcoal briquets under the brand name kingsford his brother in law eg kingsford used wood scraps from the ford factory to make the briquets in  ford partnered with thomas edison and harvey samuel firestone each contributing  to create the edison botanic research corp in fort myers florida to look for a native source of rubber ford was a prolific inventor and was awarded  us patents florida and georgia residences and community ford had a vacation residence in fort myers florida next to that of thomas edison which he bought in  and used until approximately  it is still in existence today and is open as a museum he also had a vacation home known today as the ford plantation in richmond hill georgia which is still in existence today as a private community ford started buying land in this area and eventually owned  acres  square miles there in  ford broke ground for a beautiful greek revival style mansion on the banks of the ogeechee river on the site of a s plantation the grand house made of savannahgray brick had marble steps air conditioning and an elevator it sat on  acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens the house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the vanderbilts rockefellers and the duponts it remains the centerpiece of the ford plantation today ford converted the s–era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed an underground tunnel from there to the new home providing it with steam he contributed substantially to the community building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents preserving americana ford had an interest in americana in the s ford began work to turn sudbury massachusetts into a themed historical village he moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme mary had a little lamb from sterling massachusetts and purchased the historic wayside inn this plan never saw fruition ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of greenfield village in dearborn michigan it may have inspired the creation of old sturbridge village as well about the same time he began collecting materials for his museum which had a theme of practical technology it was opened in  as the edison institute although greatly modernized the museum continues today in popular culture mr and mrs henry ford in his first car the ford quadricycle in aldous huxleys brave new

shop charitable trust for many christians the name matthew henry is immediately associated with his commentary on the bible which has deservedly gained a reputation as the best and most widely used work of its kind it is in every sense a massive exposition of scripture and has been of enormous benefit to christians from henrys contemporaries such as watts and doddridge down to our present time nearly three centuries later it was the product of many years of scholarship and industry by henry who lived through a period of great turmoil in the religious life of the country england marks of grace matthew was born in  at a farm named broadoak about three miles from whitchurch in shropshire and was the second son of philip and katherine henry his father had been an ordained clergyman in the parish of worthenbury but because his conscience would not allow him to use the new forms of liturgy introduced by the act of uniformity in  he had been ejected from his church matthew was brought up with all the advantages of a christian home and family and he showed such an aptitude for learning that he was able to read the bible by the age of three each day his parents gathered the children for morning and evening devotions and after prayers and scripture readings it was customary for his father to give a brief exposition of a passage from the bible on which the children were encouraged to write their own accounts the value of this practice was shown when matthew later recognised that it was hearing his father speaking on the text the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm  which melted his heart and caused him to enquire after christ matthews fondness for learning thrived rapidly under this routine and he spent several hours each day in private study even though his health was not very robust after surviving a serious attack of fever at the age of ten his thoughts were drawn to his own spiritual condition and on  december  he was deeply moved by a sermon on the subject of judgment he wrote i was under great fear of hell till the lord comforted me i having engaged in serious examination — what hopes i have that when i die and leave this earthly tabernacle i shall be received into heaven — i have found several marks that i am a child of god vanity of the world because of the exclusion of nonconformists from oxford and cambridge and the low moral tone of university life during the restoration period matthews father secured a place for him in  in a dissenting academy at islington in london but his stay there was shortlived because the master thomas doolittle was compelled by laws to live elsewhere and the scholars were dispersed as a result matthew continued his studies at home for several more years and then in  he went to london again this time to study law at grays inn however he found no satisfaction in this pursuit and soon he wrote a letter to his father stating the more i see of the world and the various affairs of the children of men in it the more i see of the vanity of it and the more i would fain have my heart taken off from it and fixed upon the invisible realities of the other world after barely a year he abandoned his legal studies and returned to broadoak where a friend named george illidge prevailed upon him to preach at local meetings typically henry prepared himself with great thoroughness and his zeal for the work of the gospel was so evident that he quickly began to receive invitations to preach in towns such as chester and nantwich henry knew without a doubt that this was the work god had been preparing him for and in may  he agreed to become the pastor of a congregation in chester labouring in the word for twentyfive years henry devoted himself to proclaiming the gospel in chester at every possible opportunity in addition to two services on sunday and two meetings during the week he frequently preached in the neighbouring villages and to the prisoners in chester castle his faithful exposition of the scriptures was richly blessed during these years as god opened a wider region for henrys ministry he was invited to hold monthly meetings at wrexham and beeston and to preach in many towns including london while at the same time the congregation attending his meeting house in chester grew so large that a new building had to be erected in  it is perhaps significant to note that henry maintained this intensive preaching and pastoral ministry through a period when his personal life was afflicted by tragedy his first wife katherine died in childbirth in  after only two years of marriage and although he remarried in  he and his second wife mary lost three children in infancy in the following seven years henry refused to blame god for these losses for he accepted that the lord is righteous he takes and gives and gives and takes again nor did he allow his sorrows to hinder his work since he believed weeping must not prevent sowing and so he went on with perseverance and assurance faithful unto death towards the end of  when henry was forty two years old he began to collect together the vast amount of notes and writings which he had made on the bible during his ministry he had learned latin greek and hebrew as a child and he also had a good knowledge of french so that his reading had covered a wide field over many years to this was added a keen spirit of inquiry a profound knowledge and an ability to convey doctrinal matters in a simple yet clear form from this emerged his commentary as he gradually completed the books of the old and new testament over the following ten years in  after twentyfive years in the ministry at chester henry accepted a call to a dissenting chapel at hackney in london he had never anticipated leaving chester but he trusted gods purposes in leading him to london and faithfully obeyed his preaching was blessed with much fruit and he made preparations to complete his commentary having reached acts by  henry often returned to chester to conduct services amongst his former congregation and in june  while honouring a promise to preach at chester and nantwich he was taken ill as he rode back to london the next day he fell from his horse at tarporley and was taken to the house of a neighbouring minister where he died the following day the importance and value of henrys commentary was so evident to his fellow ministers that steps were soon taken to collect the notes he had prepared on the remaining books from romans to revelation so that the whole of the bible might be included in the final work henrys commentary quickly became an indispensable work of reference for christians — whitfield read it regularly and thoroughly as part of his devotional reading — and doddridges opinion is as relevant for us today as it was in his own day henry is perhaps the only commentator so large that deserves to be entirely and attentively read
