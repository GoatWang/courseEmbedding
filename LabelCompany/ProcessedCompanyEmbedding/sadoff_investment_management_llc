limiting downside risk before we sell any holding we will carefully consider the tax impact and your personal situation additionally we will not always be fully invested in the stock or bond markets alternatively treasury bills bonds andor money markets our strategy is to sell or reduce exposure whenthe earnings for an industry particularly the weaker companies within this industry are less than

becomes too restrictiveother economic technical and psychological indicators turn bearish stock market signals one early warning sign of a major market decline typically a selloff of more than  is rising shortterm interest rates we know that a significant tightening by the fed in an attempt to suppress inflation andor intense speculation brings about this rise in shortterm rates we are always on alert when the federal reserve is tightening interest rates especially when it leads to an inverted yield curve an inverted yield curve is when shortterm rates fed funds or day tbill rates are higher than longterm rates tenyear treasury bond yields as you can see from the chart below since  almost every time the yield curve has become inverted bottom clip below zero a recession has followed the following table shows that rising shortterm interest rates have the potential to create a major market peak all major peaks have been preceded by rising shortterm rates major stock market tops are signaled well in advance by a dramatic rise in shortterm interest rates over a long period of time this increase in shortterm interest rates acts as a depressant upon stock prices corporate earnings
