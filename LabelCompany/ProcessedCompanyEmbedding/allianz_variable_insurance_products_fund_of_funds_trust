portfolio � � the allianz variable insurance products fund of funds trust �  summary prospectus � azl� mvp blackrock global strategy plus fund � � investments risks and performance principal investment strategies of the fund the fund is a fund of funds that invests primarily in a combination of three underlying mutual funds the �underlying funds� which are managed by the manager the fund is designed to provide a diversified portfolio consisting of underlying funds in equity and fixed income asset classes combined with the mvp managed volatility portfolio risk management process intended to adjust the risk of the portfolio based on quantitative indicators of market risk such as the current level of fund and market volatility under normal market conditions the manager will allocate approximately  of the fund�s assets to the underlying funds of this allocation approximately  will be allocated to the azl blackrock global allocation fund approximately  to the azl global equity index fund and approximately  to the azl enhanced bond index fund the percentage allocations to each strategy will be monitored regularly by the adviser but generally will not exceed plus or minus  of the target ranges the manager may allocate the fund�s assets outside of the target ranges specified here when the manager believes that doing so would better enable the fund to pursue its investment objective or is necessary for temporary defensive purposes up to  of the fund�s assets may be allocated to the fund�s mvp risk management process which is intended to manage the risk of the fund and its allocation to equities this process could cause the equity exposure of the fund to fluctuate but equity exposure generally will not be lower than  generally the mvp risk management process would not reduce equity exposure during periods of moderate and low market volatility during periods of extreme market volatility the mvp process could result in equity exposure that is much lower than  the manager will implement the fund�s mvp risk management process using futures futures provide the manager an effective method to reduce volatility of the fund and limit the need to decrease or increase allocations to underlying funds the process is intended to limit market exposure during periods of high volatility although the process may not always be successful in some market conditions exhibiting high volatility the process may result in the fund underperforming the market during rising markets and outperforming the market during declining markets the manager seeks to maintain an annualized volatility level for the fund at or below  over a typical business cycle ie over a period of a year or more the actual or realized volatility for shortterm or longterm periods of time will be dependent on the market environment and may be significantly higher in the event that the strategy is unsuccessful the mvp process is employed when normal market conditions as defined by the manager do not exist the azl blackrock global allocation fund seeks high total investment return it invests in a portfolio of equity debt and money market securities at any given time the underlying fund may emphasize either debt securities or equity securities in selecting equity investments the underlying fund mainly seeks securities that the underlying fund�s subadviser believes are undervalued the underlying fund may buy debt securities of varying maturities debt securities paying a fixed or fluctuating rate of interest and debt securities of any kind the underlying fund may invest up to  of its net assets in �junk bonds� corporate loans and distressed securities the underlying fund may also invest in real estate investment trusts and securities related to real assets like real estate or precious metalsrelated securities such as stocks bonds or convertible bonds issued by reits or companies that mine precious metals the azl global equity index fund seeks to match the performance of the msci world index as closely as possible it invests primarily in the securities which constitute the msci world index the azl enhanced bond index fund seeks to exceed the total return of the barclays us aggregate bond index it invests under normal market conditions at least  of its net assets in investmentgrade debt securities those of medium and high quality of all types and repurchase agreements for those securities the subadviser uses the barclays us aggregate bond index as a guide in structuring the underlying fund and selecting its investments and manages the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to the index principal risks of investing in the fund the price per share of the fund will fluctuate with changes in value of the investments held by the fund you may lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its objective as a fund of funds the fund is subject to allocation risk which is the risk associated with the manager�s decision regarding how the fund�s assets should be allocated among the various underlying investment options the manager�s decisions about the � � the allianz variable insurance products fund of funds trust �  summary prospectus � azl� mvp blackrock global strategy plus fund � allocation of the fund�s assets could cause the fund to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives there also can be no guarantee that investment decisions made by the manager will produce the desired results the fund as a shareholder of the underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any investment management fees and other expenses of the underlying fund because the fund may utilize futures pursuant to its mvp risk management process the fund also is subject to derivatives risk including risks related to futures and options investing in derivative instruments involves risks that may be different from or greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities or other traditional investments the value of options and futures contracts depend primarily upon the price of the securities indexes commodities currencies or other instruments underlying them price movements are also influenced by among other things interest rates changing supply and demand relationships trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies the cost of�options is related in part to the degree of volatility of the underlying indices securities currencies or�other assets accordingly options on highly volatile indices securities currency or other assets may be more expensive than options on other investments changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index and the fund could lose more than the principal amount invested because the fund invests primarily in the underlying funds it is subject to the following risks associated with those investments � � market risk��the market value of portfolio securities may go up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably � � issuer risk��the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons directly related to the issuer of the security � � selection risk��if an underlying fund is actively managed there can be no guarantee that investment decisions made for the fund will produce the desired results � � growth stocks risk��returns on growth stocks may not move in tandem with returns on other categories of stocks or the market as a whole growth stocks may be susceptible to rapid price swings or to adverse developments in certain sectors of the market � � leveraging risk��an underlying fund may engage in certain kinds of transactions including the use of derivatives that may give rise to a form of leverage the use of leverage may require the fund to liquidate a portfolio position at a disadvantageous time or may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the fund�s portfolio securities � � capitalization risk��investing in small to midsized companies creates risk because smaller companies may have unpredictable or limited earnings and their securities may be less liquid or experience more volatile prices than those of large companies � � credit risk��the failure of the issuer of a debt security to pay interest or repay principal in a timely manner may have an adverse impact on a fund�s earnings � � convertible securities risk��the value of convertible securities may be affected by interest rates default by the issuer on principal or interest payments and the value of the underlying stock into which the securities may be converted � � interest rate risk��debt securities held by the underlying fund may decline in value due to rising interest rates interest rates in the us are at or near historic lows which may increase the fund�s exposure to risks related to rising rates � � foreign risk��investing in the securities of nonus issuers involves a number of risks such as fluctuations in currency values adverse political social or economic developments and differences in social and economic developments or policies � � depositary receipt risk��depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as those associated with direct investment in foreign securities � � liquidity risk��an investment that is difficult to purchase or sell may have an adverse effect on the underlying fund�s returns � � private placed securities risk��an underlying fund may invest in privately placed securities which are subject to resale restrictions � � initial public offerings risk��securities purchased in initial public offerings ipos may be issued by companies with limited operating histories or companies that are undercapitalized the trading market for these securities may be limited � � portfolio turnover��an underlying fund may trade its portfolio securities frequently which could result in higher transaction costs and could adversely affect the fund�s performance � � index fund risk��an underlying fund does not attempt to manage market volatility or reduce the effects of poor bond performance in addition factors such as fund expenses selection of a representative portfolio changes in the composition of the index or the timing of purchases or redemptions of fund shares may affect the correlation between the performance of the index and the fund�s performance � � the allianz variable insurance products fund of funds trust �  summary prospectus � azl� mvp blackrock global strategy plus fund � � � call risk��if interest rates fall issuers of callable debt securities are more likely to prepay prior to the maturity date the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the prepayment in investments that will generate the same level of income � � extension risk��if interest rates rise debt securities may be paid in full more slowly than anticipated � � currency risk��investing in securities that trade in and receive revenues in foreign currencies creates risk because foreign currencies may decline relative to the us dollar resulting in a potential loss to the fund in the case of hedging positions the us dollar may decline in value relative to the currency that has been hedged � � mortgagerelated and other assetbacked risk��investing in mortgagerelated or other assetbacked securities involves a variety of risks associated with the credit markets such as rising or falling interest rates increases in the

example to cash flow problems insufficient foreign currency reserves political considerations the relative size of the governmental entity�s debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place economic reforms required by the international monetary fund or other multilateral agencies � � us government obligations risk��certain securities in which the fund may invest including securities issued by certain government agencies and government sponsored enterprises are not guaranteed by the us government or supported by the full faith and credit of the united states performance
