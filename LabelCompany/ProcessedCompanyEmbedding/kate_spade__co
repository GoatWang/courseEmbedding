december   previously best things to buy in   show thumbnailsthe holiday shopping season is in full swing as youre buying holiday gifts and checking off your shopping list you should also keep in mind retailers return policies theres a good chance that something from your holiday shopping trips will get returned since twothirds  percent of consumers indicated last year that they returned gifts most or some of the time according to the national retail federations gift receiving and returning report fortunately most retailers offer fair return policies —  percent of shoppers think they dohowever some return policies definitely favor customers more than others gobankingrates found in its annual survey of retailers return policies looking at return time limits receipt policies and other terms this survey ranked  major retailers return policies from best to worst click through to see the stores that make returns a breeze — and those with the worst return policiesread the best and worst online retailers for holiday savings  show thumbnails best return policiesthe best return policies make it simple and easy for customers to return or exchange a purchase if they arent satisfied in fact many of the  best return policies place no time limits on returns and some will accept exchanges and returns even for wellused itemsthese favorable return policies truly put the customer first which is a huge help for a shopper struggling with a holiday spending hangover or a giftee dealing with a haul of unwanted presents click through to see the  stores with the most generous return policies this holiday season  show thumbnails nordstrom return policynordstrom made our list of the best return policies last year and its generous policy put it among the best this year nordstrom is unique because it actually has no return policy the store handles returns on a casebycase basis with the ultimate objective of satisfying the customer according to its website the stores site also said it has a philosophy to ensure its customers are satisfied and will always try to deal with customers fairly and reasonablyin practice this gives nordstrom team members a lot of flexibility on returns which can work in the customers favor for instance there is no time limit on returns or exchanges and nordstroms return policy does not have any hardandfast rules against returning items without a receipt without tags or that have been worn special occasion dresses excluded nordstroms online return policy is similarly generous and return shipping is freeshoppers should note that the nordstrom rack return policy is different granting  days to return items and requiring returns to have original tags and receipt or packing sliprelated  top credit cards for earning rewards on your holiday shopping  show thumbnails llbean return policylike nordstrom llbeans return policy focuses on making sure youre happy if your purchase isnt completely satisfactory were happy to accept your exchange or return at any time for items purchased directly from us according to the llbean return policy page llbean items can be exchanged or returned at any time with no limits — even after years of usehaving a receipt handy will make a return easier but it is not required returns made without a receipt will be refunded in the form of store credit at the items current selling price or replaced by an exchange for a similar item returns can also be completed by mail  show thumbnails bed bath  beyond return policybed bath  beyond makes returns relatively easy with few restrictions accepting returns in store and by mail the retailer even covers return shipping costs the bed bath  beyond return policy carries no time limit which allows buyers to return a purchase at any time with some exceptions with a receipt refunds are issued in the original form of payment except for returns made with gift receipts which are refunded with merchandise creditwithout a receipt a bed bath  beyond

show thumbnails jcpenney return policyjcpenney will make a full return at any time on its items it also accepts returns and exchanges without a receipt theres no indication that original packaging is always required except on certain types of items like electronics and special occasion dresses returns made without a receipt or with a gift receipt will receive store creditwhile jcpenney is another retailer with no time limit on returns it also has more exceptions to this rule for furniture fine jewelry and electronics many of these types of items will also require a sales receipt for return in general however jcpenneys return policy gives customers plenty of leeway to get an exchange or refund when they want it  show thumbnails costco return policycostco places no time limit on returns and the store strives to guarantee your satisfaction on every product we sell with a full refund the costco return policy allows for items to be returned at any time consumer electronics are the exceptions to this rule but even these products receive a day window for returnscostco prefers customers include the original packaging and bring their receipt when possible however these arent required and employees will still do our best to process your return without it in most cases because costco requires a membership to shop at its stores purchases can be looked up on the membership if the customer no longer has a receipt costco offers returns at its stores only and not through mail except for large or heavy items for which the warehouse retailer can arrange pickup  show thumbnails

satisfaction guarantee you have a year to decide if youre satisfied with your purchase and if you arent rei will replace or refund your purchase rei will even accept returns on open and used items though it clarifies that its guarantee doesnt cover damage from normal wear and tear improper use or accidentsthe only factor that kept rei out of the top five is its policy not to accept any returns

past purchases even without a receipt  show thumbnails macy’s return policymacys return policy allows buyers to return a purchase at any time with no time limit which is the main perk that made it one

whether the store typically offered extended holiday returns other return policy terms unique to retailers were considered in the rankings as they benefited the customer up next outrageous purchases of the filthy rich view all comments  nancy baird i have never had a problem returning an item at walmart i go to customer service give them the item and receipt and they immediately give me the money chris as a former sales manager in several department and big box stores return policies are put in place with the best of intentions but usually end up with the worst of results liberal return policies allow a customer to use a product sometimes for quite a while before deciding the product didn’t work out or she simply wants a new one of the product purchased many many times my hands were tied because the return policy forced me to issue a credit or new merchandise six months or more after a product was purchased obviously exceptions have to be made when a item is defective a week after it was purchased but when an item such as a dress handbag or jewelry is purchased for the sole purpose of one wearing to a prom or a wedding and then returned or when someone brings back a beat up backpack because “it didn’t hold up” a year after its purchase the store loses money less profit means less payroll which means fewer jobs fewer people on the sales floor results in poor customer service and low morale among the staff in addition many times large purchases are made during promotions in which free gifts or additional discount coupons are offered when the return is made the gift or coupon is rarely if ever surrendered allowing the customer to shop with a discount to which she would not otherwise be entitled upper management more often than not will let the issue of the return of a wellworn item go as the customer doing the return knows the last thing store personnel want is a scene in some cases which happens more than one realizes the word “lawsuit” or “discrimination” is used by a customer to ensure she gets hisher way stores need to set realistic guidelines for returns which are favorable to a customer yet maintain a level of business integrity policies such a “lifetime guarantee” or “no questions asked” simply do not work in a society that demands what it wants when it wants it but takes no responsibility for itself moonbeamwatcher love to know about your opinion about “best buy” which in my experience is the absolute worst from “restocking fee” to refusing to make exchange of unused music cd’s nevrer opened that has cost worst buy all my apliance purchases dorm refrigerators to tv’s opinionatedtoo you show  stores but you don’t say whether they are good or bad jenny i’m not sure why macy’s is so high on the list except that their return policy looks good on paper i had two occasions where i tried to return an item with receipt within the allotted time period and was told i had to return it to the macy’s location where it was bought and not just any macy’s location that’s difficult if you live in dallas and a relative from new orleans sent you the item as a gift seriously i have to keep it or drive  hours to the exact same store i thought it was a national chain i haven’t shopped at macy’s in  years because of that and i’ve instructed my entire family to never buy me things from there again share x open a new bank account check

cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll
