much of his nba career and a number of sudden changes to the yearold’s hairline his hair was in pristine shape last september for the release of the lebron  but james appeared to be bald a few days later have left fans wondering what’s really going on tony gutierrezap some suspect that james uses special hair products or hair powders like bigen to give the appearance of having real hair but james’ personal barber nick castemanos swears that james’ hair is completely natural via yahoo “there is no dye no additives no preservatives everyone thinks he’s dying his hair using temporary hair colorings bigen or black ice it’s all his hair they still don’t believe me i get bigen comments all the time… i’ve become numb to it it used to bother me it’s not easy to hear that” ken blazeusa today sports in an extensive interview with yahoo sports castemanos recounts his remarkable career path he cut hair for nba players in miami for years before james arrived and after james returned to cleveland he asked castemanos to move to ohio and revealed that james is much more particular about his beard than his hair “lebron is very tedious about how his hair is cut the beard is the no  thing he leaves the top up to me i leave him less bald he’s my guy he’s my hardest haircut he has good hair you have to cut it right” cleveland cavaliers hair lebron james nba k shares share tweet sms send

return home to the cleveland cavaliers minus the boys and girls club this time then he shed some serious weight thanks to a carbcutting diet and now it appears that his hair has grown back on the top of his head on tuesday night james appeared at nike’s oregon headquarters to promote the release of his new lebron  line of shoes but … that hair  what’s the opposite of receded growth i guess lebron’s hair has magically grown back  james entered the national radar as a teenager and the  season with the cavaliers will be his th in the nba point is fans have witnessed james’ hairline steadily recede and hide beneath a headband for over a decade check a photo timeline here for reference the hair comeback is most noticeable in the power alleys james didn’t quite have the deep alleys
