has been filed on behalf of purchasers of certain mortgagebacked securities sponsored by affiliates of countrywide financial corporation and its whollyowned subsidiary countrywide home loans inc collectively “countrywide” and related trusts the “issuing trusts” issued between  and  the case has been assigned a civil action number of cvsjopjw and is pending in the united states district court for the central district of california you can view a copy of the complaint here and to the left under case documents  the complaint alleges claims under the securities act of  the “securities act” as a class action on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the following certificates the “class” or “plaintiffs” alternative loan trust certificates issued by cwalt inc “cwalt” cwabs assetbacked trust certificates issued by cwabs inc “cwabs” chl mortgage passthrough trust certificates issued in  and  by cwmbs inc “cwmbs” and cwheq revolving home equity loan trusts and home equity loan trusts issued by cwheq inc “cwheq” collectively referred to as the “certificates”   the complaint alleges that defendants issued the certificates pursuant or traceable to certain registration statements the “registration statements” filed with the us securities and exchange commission “sec”  the certificates were then sold to class members pursuant to certain prospectuses the “prospectus supplements” which also were filed with the sec and incorporated by reference into the registration statements  the complaint charges that the registration statements and prospectus supplements issued in connection with the certificates contained materially false and misleading statements and omitted material information in violation of sections  a and  of the securities act   specifically the complaint charges that countrywide certain officers and directors of cwalt cwabs cwmbs and cwheq and certain investment banks which served as underwriters of the certificates violated the securities act by issuing the certificates pursuant to registration statements and prospectus supplements that misstated and omitted material information regarding inter alia the process used to originate and the quality of mortgages that were pooled in the issuing trusts and were used as the financial basis for the certificates  for example the complaint alleges that countrywide did not follow the underwriting and appraisal standards described in the registration statements and prospectus supplements  indeed countrywide issued mortgages to borrowers that did not satisfy the requisite eligibility criteria as described in the registration statements and prospectus supplements  likewise the mortgages held by the issuing trusts and underlying the certificates were based on collateral appraisals that overstated the value of the underlying properties thus exposing the issuing trusts and class members to losses in the event of foreclosure  as a result of the material misrepresentations and omissions in the registration statements and prospectus supplements investors purchased securities that were far riskier than represented   according to the complaint by mid the mortgages held by the issuing trusts and underlying the certificates began suffering accelerating delinquencies and defaults the defaults led to real estate foreclosures which revealed that the properties underlying the mortgages were worth materially less than the loans issued to the borrowers and the borrowers did not have sufficient financial wherewithal to cover the outstanding mortgage balances  the representations made in the prospectus supplements were materially false and misleading because at the time of the certificates offerings countrywide’s underwriting standards were not designed to evaluate a borrower’s ability to repay or the true value of the mortgaged property underlying the certificates  these adverse factors were not revealed andor adequately addressed in the offering documents  had plaintiffs and the other members of the class known the truth they would not have purchased the certificates or they would not have purchased them at the inflated prices that were paid  plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of the certificates issued between  and  cohen milstein sellers  toll pllc has significant experience in prosecuting investor
