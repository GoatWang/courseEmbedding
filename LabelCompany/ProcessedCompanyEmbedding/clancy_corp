petrochemicals lanolin or mineral oil   brief history of our products soap making history goes back many thousands years the most basic supplies for soap making were those taken from animal and nature many people made soap by mixing animal fats with lye today soap is produce from fats and an alkali the cold process method is the most popular soap making process today while some soap makers use the historical hot process in the early beginnings of soap making it was an exclusive technique used by small groups of soap makers over time recipes for soap making became more widely known back then plant byproducts and animal and vegetable oils were the main ingredients of soap the price of soap was significantly reduced in  when a frenchman by the name of leblanc discovered a chemical process that allowed soap to be sold for significantly less money more than  years later another frenchman identified relationships between glycerin fats and acid what marked the beginning of modern soap making since that time there have been no major discoveries and the same processes are used for the soap making we use and enjoy today in the midnineteenth century soap for bathing became a separate commodity from laundry soap with milder soaps being packaged sold and made available for personal use liquid hand soaps were invented in the s and this invention keeps soaps in the public view ​ types of handcrafted soap while the chemical reaction that creates soap is always the same different types of soaps can be made by different methods all still relying upon that basic chemical reaction that occurs cold process soap hot process soap transparent soap «glycerin» soap readymade soap bases print  sitemap   clancy corp login web viewmobile view logout  edit page clancy corporation  powering
