in the latch mechanism means for retaining the ammunitionholding cylinder with the barrel while allowing easy removal and an improved mechanism for intermittently freeing rotation of the ammunitionholding cylinder  background art breaktop handguns of the revolver type have been known for many years however the latch mechanism holding the barrel section to the frame when the gun is in the firing position has presented a problem in compensating for wear due to repeated opening and closing of the barrel section the latch mechanisms of the prior art also have not had sufficient strength to provide for safe use particularly when highpowered ammunition is utilized disclosure of invention this invention relates to a breaktop handheld revolver and to improvements in the latch mechanism means for holding the cylinder in place with the barrel section of the revolver and improved means for intermittent release of the cylinder for revolution after firing the latch assembly is pivotally mounted to the frame and includes an upsidedown ushaped latch with the legs of the u pivotally attached to the frame adjacent an upwardly inclined plane which is integral with the rear end of the barrel section an annular rotatable pin having a flat surface intermediate its ends extends between the legs of the ushaped latch member the flat surface contacting the surface of the inclined plane of the barrel section when the barrel section of the gun is locked in place on the frame for firing the ushaped latch is biased forwardly and together with the rotatable pin whose flat surface engages the inclined plane adjusts for any wear of the inclined plane surface or the pin caused by repeated opening and closing of the barrel section relative to the frame of the weapon the gun also includes an improved linkage activated when the trigger is moved rearwardly by the operator of the gun to release the ammunitionholding cylinder for rotation and lock the cylinder in place prior to firing of the gun also disclosed is a caging mechanism for holding the cylinder of the handgun in fixed position relative to the barrel of the gun yet allowing the cylinder to be easily removed the cylinder includes a central internal bore extending partway therethrough the bore is slipped over a shaft extending parallel to and below the barrel of the gun the rear of the barrel section of the gun extends over the cylinder and includes a downwardly extending lip portion which engages the butt or rear end of the cylinder to prevent it from disengaging from the barrel section when the barrel and frame sections are unlatched brief description of the drawings fig  is a side view of the breaktop revolver of this invention fig  is a partial perspective view of the latch member of the latch mechanism for holding the barrel section of the revolver firmly in place relative to the frame of the gun when the gun is in condition for firing fig  is a partial vertical crosssection of the latch mechanism of the revolver of fig  illustrating the manner in which the mechanism compensates for wear occurring during repeated opening and closing of the barrel section relative to the frame section of the gun fig  is a partial vertical crosssection of the ammunitionholding cylinder of the gun of fig  illustrating the linkage between the trigger and cylinder which on movement of the trigger rearwardly by the operator of the gun frees the cylinder for rotation fig  is an end view along section line  of fig  figs  illustrate movement of the linkage as the trigger is moved rearwardly to fire the gun and fig  is a partial vertical crosssectional view of the gun of fig  illustrating the manner in which the ammunitionholding cylinder is caged in place to the barrel section yet allowing easy removal best mode for carrying out the invention fig  depicts a breaktop revolver handgun which includes a frame  of conventional design which includes a handle  a pivotally mounted trigger  and a hammer  operated by the trigger to engage a firing pin not shown all of conventional design a barrel section  including an ammunitionholding cylinder  is secured to a forward extension of the frame  by pivot pin  the latch assembly  for holding the barrel section  in fixed relation to the frame  contacts a rearward extension of the barrel section as will be described referring to figs  and  the barrel section  includes an integral rearward extension  extending beyond the rear entrance end of the cylinder  this rearward extension includes an upwardly inclined surface  which cooperates with the latch member shown in fig  to lock the barrel section to the frame  of the revolver for firing referring to fig  the latch member is an upsidedown ushaped member  having integral rearward extensions  provided with pads  of greater width for engagement by the thumb or other finger of the operator of the gun to pivot the latch member rearwardly to allow the barrel section to be broken away from the frame  about pivot pin  the latch member  is pivotally secured to the frame below the rearward extension  of the barrel section as illustrated in fig  by pivot pin  an annular bore  extends the width of the latch member  as illustrated in fig  for receiving an annular pin  having a flattened surface  intermediate the ends of the pin this annular surface engaging the inclined plane surface  the pin  is rotatably mounted in bore  when the barrel section is latched to the frame  the flat surface  of the pin engages the inclined surface  of the rearward extension of the barrel section  the latch member  and pin  are biased forwardly by two wire springs  which terminate at one end in openings  drilled in pin  as illustrated in fig  the openings are sufficiently large to allow the pin  to rotate within bore  a small amount in either direction the wires  extend down the interior sides of each of the legs of the latch member  around the pivot pin  down the underside of the latch member extensions  and are terminated at points  in the frame of the gun as illustrated in fig  the forward bias of the latch member  and pin  against the inclined plane surface  of the rearward extension  of the barrel section provides a secure tight lock between the barrel section and the frame at all times and eliminates any play or looseness that may develop due to wear of the inclined surface  and the surface  of the pin  due to repeated opening and closing of the gun as the surfaces wear the pin  and latch member  adjust and compensate for such wear in addition the forward bias of the latch member  against the inclined plane surface  always keeps the barrel section  and frame  in secure locking arrangement figs  illustrate an improved linkage activated by the trigger  of the gun to allow the cylinder  to revolve to the next adjacent opening holding ammunition prior to firing of the round of ammunition in the cylinder referring to fig  the cylinder includes a series of spaced notches  adapted to receive detent  of the linkage one sidewall  of each of the notches is dished out to allow the detent to slide into the notch as the cylinder is rotate in the direction of the arrow shown in fig  the detent is an integral part of the linkage which includes a forward body portion  containing an elongated slot  see fig  the linkage is mounted to both pivot about pivot pin  as well as slide horizontally in slot  the pivot pin  is deadended to the frame of the gun a spring  has one end biased against surface  of the linkage is wrapped about the pivot pin  and is deadended in the frame of the gun the detent  is biased upwardly through an opening in the frame beneath the cylinder  the trigger  is mounted to pivot about pivot point a and includes a finger  which engages a slot  of the detent as illustrated in fig  as the trigger is moved rearwardly about its pivot point a it pulls the linkage and detent  downwardly as illustrated in fig  to free the cylinder  for rotation as the trigger is moved further rearwardly as illustrated in fig  the terminal edge of the finger slips out of the slot  and engages surface  of the detent as illustrated in fig  to exert an upward and forward force on the linkage as the cylinder revolves the detent  lodges in the next adjacent notch  as illustrated in fig  as the trigger is further moved rearwardly the gun fires then when the trigger is released and is moved forwardly as illustrated in fig  the linkage  and detent  are moved horizontally in the direction of the upper arrow of fig  until the terminal edge of the finger  again engages the slot  whereupon the spring  urges the linkage  rearward to the position illustrated in fig  fig  illustrates a further improvement of the revolvertype handgun in caging or trapping the cylinder  so that it will remain with the barrel section  when the barrel section is pivoted away from the frame  about pivot pin  on release of the latch referring to fig  the cylinder  includes a bore opening in the forward end thereof which receives the terminal end of the shaft  the cylinder  is rotatably mounted on the rear end of the shaft  for free rotation however the cylinder would disengage from the shaft without something to hold it in place in this regard the upper portion of the barrel section  includes a downwardly extending lip  which engages the rear peripheral edge of the cylinder  preventing it from disengaging from the shaft on breaking away of the barrel section from the frame of the gun to pivot about pivot  for cleaning loading or unloading ammunition the cylinder  is easily removable however by removing shaft  thus allowing the cylinder  to be easily removed these improvements to a breaktop handgun of the revolver type provide the gun with greater accuracy greater safety and smoother operation  previous patent pressable latch for       next patent adapters for convert  home search services communities help contact us advertise on
