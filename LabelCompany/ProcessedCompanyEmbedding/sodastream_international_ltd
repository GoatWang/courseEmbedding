sodastream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial zone in the west bank according to the israeli human rights group btselem the mishor adumim factory was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by the israeli army the european unions highest court ruled in  that sodastream was not entitled to claim a made in israel exemption from eu customs payments for products manufactured in the west bank because israeli settlements in the west bank are outside the territorial scope of the ecisrael agreement in january  oxfam accepted the resignation of scarlett johansson an american actress who is half jewish as ambassador for that organisation a role she had held for eight years after she became a brand ambassador for sodastream oxfam has stated that businesses such as sodastream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law johansson reportedly resigned because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement in her statement she described sodastream as not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between israel and palestine supporting neighbours working alongside each other receiving equal pay equal benefits and equal rights sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum has also accused oxfam of supporting the bds movement against israel as a whole a charge oxfam denied saying that this is about trade from the settlements and specific to settlements outside israels pre border which oxfam states due to their location pose an obstacle to any future twostate solution norway sweden and finland have boycotted sodastream products from the mishor adumim factorycitation needed according to birnbaum the boycott had no impact on the growth rate

campaigning to remove sodastream from stores must compensate sodastream € because the group falsely claimed the products are sold illegally and fraudulently due to their use of the made in israel label while being partly manufactured in the west bank human rights watch stated that it is impossible to ignore the israeli system of unlawful discrimination land confiscation natural resource theft and forced displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank where sodastream is located the united church of canada launched a campaign to boycott sodastream products manufactured in the west bank in july  uk department store john lewis removed all sodastream products from its stores amidst growing bds pressure and declining sales its oxford street london store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of sodastream products in july  after two years of weekly bds protests sodastream also closed its brighton store birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical we dont take sides in this conflict he described the factory as building bridges between us and the palestinian population and we provide our palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits sodastream employs  west bank palestinians addressing the location of sodastreams maale adumim plant birnbaum said were here for historical reasons the choice was made by company founder peter weissburgh back in the s long before sodastream was taken over by the current owners who appointed birnbaum in  birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agendai just cant see how it would help the cause of the palestinians if we fired them supporters of the factory cite the west banks high unemployment rate and low gdp as evidence the jobs are badly needed opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the israeli presence has on the palestinian economy others have argued that sodastream is exploiting local cheap labour workers incomes at the factory are substantially above the  shekelmonth palestinian authority minimum wage all but one of the palestinian employees interviewed by the christian science monitor supported johanssons stance and opposed a boycott of sodastream stating that a boycott would only hurt them one palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for sodastream and felt like a slave working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day another palestinian employee interviewed by reuters reported that most of the managers are israeli and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced in december  harvard university dining services halted sodastream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the harvard college palestine solidarity committee and the harvard islamic society a few days later however harvards president drew faust reversed the decision claiming she had not been aware of it in the

its advertising firing of palestinian workersedit in july  sodastream fired  palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break ramadan fasts during night shifts

when it relocated however the israeli government refused to renew the palestinians work permits sodastream protested the government decision some news sources reported that sodastream blamed the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds for the closing of its plant mahmoud nawajaa the bds coordinator in ramallah called the loss of palestinian jobs at sodastream part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation however sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum blamed benjamin netanyahu for the palestinian job losses according to birnbaum all of the palestinian employees had passed israeli security clearance but were nevertheless denied permits to work after netanyahu intervened birnbaum claims that netanyahu wanted the palestinians fired so he could then

sodastream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial zone in the west bank according to the israeli human rights group btselem the mishor adumim factory was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by the israeli army the european unions highest court ruled in  that sodastream was not entitled to claim a made in israel exemption from eu customs payments for products manufactured in the west bank because israeli settlements in the west bank are outside the territorial scope of the ecisrael agreement in january  oxfam accepted the resignation of scarlett johansson an american actress who is half jewish as ambassador for that organisation a role she had held for eight years after she became a brand ambassador for sodastream oxfam has stated that businesses such as sodastream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law johansson reportedly resigned because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement in her statement she described sodastream as not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between israel and palestine supporting neighbours working alongside each other receiving equal pay equal benefits and equal rights sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum has also accused oxfam of supporting the bds movement against israel as a whole a charge oxfam denied saying that this is about trade from the settlements and specific to settlements outside israels pre border which oxfam states due to their location pose an obstacle to any future twostate solution norway sweden and finland have boycotted sodastream products from the mishor adumim factorycitation needed according to birnbaum the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of sodastream and he said all sodastream products sold in norway sweden and finland are manufactured in china in january  a paris court ruled that association france palestine solidarité afps a group campaigning to remove sodastream from stores must compensate sodastream € because the group falsely claimed the products are sold illegally and fraudulently due to their use of the made in israel label while being partly manufactured in the west bank human rights watch stated that it is impossible to ignore the israeli system of unlawful discrimination land confiscation natural resource theft and forced displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank where sodastream is located the united church of canada launched a campaign to boycott sodastream products manufactured in the west bank in july  uk department store john lewis removed all sodastream products from its stores amidst growing bds pressure and declining sales its oxford street london store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of sodastream products in july  after two years of weekly bds protests sodastream also closed its brighton store birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical we dont take sides in this conflict he described the factory as building bridges between us and the palestinian population and we provide our palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits sodastream employs  west bank palestinians addressing the location of sodastreams maale adumim plant birnbaum said were here for historical reasons the choice was made by company founder peter weissburgh back in the s long before sodastream was taken over by the current owners who appointed birnbaum in  birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agendai just cant see how it would help the cause of the palestinians if we fired them supporters of the factory cite the west banks high unemployment rate and low gdp as evidence the jobs are badly needed opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the israeli presence has on the palestinian economy others have argued that sodastream is exploiting local cheap labour workers incomes at the factory are substantially above the  shekelmonth palestinian authority minimum wage all but one of the palestinian employees interviewed by the christian science monitor supported johanssons stance and opposed a boycott of sodastream stating that a boycott would only hurt them one palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for sodastream and felt like a slave working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day another palestinian employee interviewed by reuters reported that most of the managers are israeli and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced in december  harvard university dining services halted sodastream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the harvard college palestine solidarity committee and the harvard islamic society a few days later however harvards president drew faust reversed the decision claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place when french host cyril hanouna aired a homophobic prank on french tv in may  sodastream first refused to stop advertising and supporting hanounas program but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising firing of palestinian workersedit in july  sodastream fired  palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break ramadan fasts during night shifts

transferred to a new factory in lehavim where it will reportedly employ a significant number of bedouin arabs the move laid off  palestinian workers although  palestinian workers moved with sodastream when it relocated however the israeli government refused to renew the palestinians work permits sodastream protested the government decision some news sources reported that sodastream blamed the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds for the closing of its plant mahmoud nawajaa the bds coordinator in ramallah called the loss of palestinian jobs at sodastream part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation however sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum blamed benjamin netanyahu for the palestinian job losses according to birnbaum all of the palestinian employees had passed israeli security clearance but were nevertheless denied permits to work after netanyahu intervened birnbaum claims that netanyahu wanted the palestinians fired so he could then

sodastream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial zone in the west bank according to the israeli human rights group btselem the mishor adumim factory was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by the israeli army the european unions highest court ruled in  that sodastream was not entitled to claim a made in israel exemption from eu customs payments for products manufactured in the west bank because israeli settlements in the west bank are outside the territorial scope of the ecisrael agreement in january  oxfam accepted the resignation of scarlett johansson an american actress who is half jewish as ambassador for that organisation a role she had held for eight years after she became a brand ambassador for sodastream oxfam has stated that businesses such as sodastream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law johansson reportedly resigned because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement in her statement she described sodastream as not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between israel and palestine supporting neighbours working alongside each other receiving equal pay equal benefits and equal rights sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum has also accused oxfam of supporting the bds movement against israel as a whole a charge oxfam denied saying that this is about trade from the settlements and specific to settlements outside israels pre border which oxfam states due to their location pose an obstacle to any future twostate solution norway sweden and finland have boycotted sodastream products from the mishor adumim factorycitation needed according to birnbaum the boycott had no impact on the growth rate

campaigning to remove sodastream from stores must compensate sodastream € because the group falsely claimed the products are sold illegally and fraudulently due to their use of the made in israel label while being partly manufactured in the west bank human rights watch stated that it is impossible to ignore the israeli system of unlawful discrimination land confiscation natural resource theft and forced displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank where sodastream is located the united church of canada launched a campaign to boycott sodastream products manufactured in the west bank in july  uk department store john lewis removed all sodastream products from its stores amidst growing bds pressure and declining sales its oxford street london store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of sodastream products in july  after two years of weekly bds protests sodastream also closed its brighton store birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical we dont take sides in this conflict he described the factory as building bridges between us and the palestinian population and we provide our palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits sodastream employs  west bank palestinians addressing the location of sodastreams maale adumim plant birnbaum said were here for historical reasons the choice was made by company founder peter weissburgh back in the s long before sodastream was taken over by the current owners who appointed birnbaum in  birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agendai just cant see how it would help the cause of the palestinians if we fired them supporters of the factory cite the west banks high unemployment rate and low gdp as evidence the jobs are badly needed opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the israeli presence has on the palestinian economy others have argued that sodastream is exploiting local cheap labour workers incomes at the factory are substantially above the  shekelmonth palestinian authority minimum wage all but one of the palestinian employees interviewed by the christian science monitor supported johanssons stance and opposed a boycott of sodastream stating that a boycott would only hurt them one palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for sodastream and felt like a slave working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day another palestinian employee interviewed by reuters reported that most of the managers are israeli and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced in december  harvard university dining services halted sodastream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the harvard college palestine solidarity committee and the harvard islamic society a few days later however harvards president drew faust reversed the decision claiming she had not been aware of it in the

when it relocated however the israeli government refused to renew the palestinians work permits sodastream protested the government decision some news sources reported that sodastream blamed the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds for the closing of its plant mahmoud nawajaa the bds coordinator in ramallah called the loss of palestinian jobs at sodastream part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation however sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum blamed benjamin netanyahu for the palestinian job losses according to birnbaum all of the palestinian employees had passed israeli security clearance but were nevertheless denied permits to work after netanyahu intervened birnbaum claims that netanyahu wanted the palestinians fired so he could then

sodastream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial zone in the west bank according to the israeli human rights group btselem the mishor adumim factory was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by the israeli army the european unions highest court ruled in  that sodastream was not entitled to claim a made in israel exemption from eu customs payments for products manufactured in the west bank because israeli settlements in the west bank are outside the territorial scope of the ecisrael agreement in january  oxfam accepted the resignation of scarlett johansson an american actress who is half jewish as ambassador for that organisation a role she had held for eight years after she became a brand ambassador for sodastream oxfam has stated that businesses such as sodastream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law johansson reportedly resigned because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement in her statement she described sodastream as not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between israel and palestine supporting neighbours working alongside each other receiving equal pay equal benefits and equal rights sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum has also accused oxfam of supporting the bds movement against israel as a whole a charge oxfam denied saying that this is about trade from the settlements and specific to settlements outside israels pre border which oxfam states due to their location pose an obstacle to any future twostate solution norway sweden and finland have boycotted sodastream products from the mishor adumim factorycitation needed according to birnbaum the boycott had no impact on the growth rate

campaigning to remove sodastream from stores must compensate sodastream € because the group falsely claimed the products are sold illegally and fraudulently due to their use of the made in israel label while being partly manufactured in the west bank human rights watch stated that it is impossible to ignore the israeli system of unlawful discrimination land confiscation natural resource theft and forced displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank where sodastream is located the united church of canada launched a campaign to boycott sodastream products manufactured in the west bank in july  uk department store john lewis removed all sodastream products from its stores amidst growing bds pressure and declining sales its oxford street london store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of sodastream products in july  after two years of weekly bds protests sodastream also closed its brighton store birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical we dont take sides in this conflict he described the factory as building bridges between us and the palestinian population and we provide our palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits sodastream employs  west bank palestinians addressing the location of sodastreams maale adumim plant birnbaum said were here for historical reasons the choice was made by company founder peter weissburgh back in the s long before sodastream was taken over by the current owners who appointed birnbaum in  birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agendai just cant see how it would help the cause of the palestinians if we fired them supporters of the factory cite the west banks high unemployment rate and low gdp as evidence the jobs are badly needed opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the israeli presence has on the palestinian economy others have argued that sodastream is exploiting local cheap labour workers incomes at the factory are substantially above the  shekelmonth palestinian authority minimum wage all but one of the palestinian employees interviewed by the christian science monitor supported johanssons stance and opposed a boycott of sodastream stating that a boycott would only hurt them one palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for sodastream and felt like a slave working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day another palestinian employee interviewed by reuters reported that most of the managers are israeli and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced in december  harvard university dining services halted sodastream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the harvard college palestine solidarity committee and the harvard islamic society a few days later however harvards president drew faust reversed the decision claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place when french host cyril hanouna aired a homophobic prank on french tv in may  sodastream first refused to stop advertising and supporting hanounas program but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising firing of palestinian workersedit in july  sodastream fired  palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break ramadan fasts during night shifts

when it relocated however the israeli government refused to renew the palestinians work permits sodastream protested the government decision some news sources reported that sodastream blamed the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds for the closing of its plant mahmoud nawajaa the bds coordinator in ramallah called the loss of palestinian jobs at sodastream part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation however sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum blamed benjamin netanyahu for the palestinian job losses according to birnbaum all of the palestinian employees had passed israeli security clearance but were nevertheless denied permits to work after netanyahu intervened birnbaum claims that netanyahu wanted the palestinians fired so he could then

mount laurel new jersey controversyedit as part of the boycott divestment and sanctions bds activist campaign launched in  to pressure israel to end the occupation of among other places the west bank sodastream has been criticized for operating its primary manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial zone in the west bank according to the israeli human rights group btselem the mishor adumim factory was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by the israeli army the european unions highest court ruled in  that sodastream was not entitled to claim a made in israel exemption from eu customs payments for products manufactured in the west bank because israeli settlements in the west bank are outside the territorial scope of the ecisrael agreement in january  oxfam accepted the resignation of scarlett johansson an american actress who is half jewish as ambassador for that organisation a role she had held for eight years after she became a brand ambassador for sodastream oxfam has stated that businesses such as sodastream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support and opposes all trade with the settlements citing their illegality under international law johansson reportedly resigned because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement in her statement she described sodastream as not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between israel and palestine supporting neighbours working alongside each other receiving equal pay equal benefits and equal rights sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum has also accused oxfam of supporting the bds movement against israel as a whole a charge oxfam denied saying that this is about trade from the settlements and specific to settlements outside israels pre border which oxfam states due to their location pose an obstacle to any future twostate solution norway sweden and finland have boycotted sodastream products from the mishor adumim factorycitation needed according to birnbaum the boycott had no impact on the growth rate of sodastream and he said all sodastream products sold in norway sweden and finland are manufactured in china in january  a paris court ruled that association france palestine solidarité afps a group campaigning to remove sodastream from stores must compensate sodastream € because the group falsely claimed the products are sold illegally and fraudulently due to their use of the made in israel label while being partly manufactured in the west bank human rights watch stated that it is impossible to ignore the israeli system of unlawful discrimination land confiscation natural resource theft and forced displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank where sodastream is located the united church of canada launched a campaign to boycott sodastream products manufactured in the west bank in july  uk department store john lewis removed all sodastream products from its stores amidst growing bds pressure and declining sales its oxford street london store has been the site of biweekly protests against the sale of sodastream products in july  after two years of weekly bds protests sodastream also closed its brighton store birnbaum said that the factories are apolitical we dont take sides in this conflict he described the factory as building bridges between us and the palestinian population and we provide our palestinian employees with respectable employment opportunities and an appropriate salary and benefits sodastream employs  west bank palestinians addressing the location of sodastreams maale adumim plant birnbaum said were here for historical reasons the choice was made by company founder peter weissburgh back in the s long before sodastream was taken over by the current owners who appointed birnbaum in  birnbaum said that factory presence was a reality and he would not bow to political pressure to close it we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political agendai just cant see how it would help the cause of the palestinians if we fired them supporters of the factory cite the west banks high unemployment rate and low gdp as evidence the jobs are badly needed opponents have argued that the small number of jobs provided by the factories in the settlements do not outweigh the effect the israeli presence has on the palestinian economy others have argued that sodastream is exploiting local cheap labour workers incomes at the factory are substantially above the  shekelmonth palestinian authority minimum wage all but one of the palestinian employees interviewed by the christian science monitor supported johanssons stance and opposed a boycott of sodastream stating that a boycott would only hurt them one palestinian employee said he was ashamed to work for sodastream and felt like a slave working on an assembly line for twelve hours a day another palestinian employee interviewed by reuters reported that most of the managers are israeli and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced in december  harvard university dining services halted sodastream machine purchases for its dining facilities due to demonstrations by the harvard college palestine solidarity committee and the harvard islamic society a few days later however harvards president drew faust reversed the decision claiming she had not been aware of it in the first place when french host cyril hanouna aired a homophobic prank on french tv in may  sodastream first refused to stop advertising and supporting hanounas program but eventually decided to withdraw its advertising firing of palestinian workersedit in july  sodastream fired  palestinian workers after they complained about not receiving sufficient food to break ramadan fasts during night shifts

hearings and were given severance pay sodastream announced that its factory in maale adumim would be closed by the end of  in order to save  million in production costs the plants operations will be transferred to a new factory in lehavim where it will reportedly employ a significant number of bedouin arabs the move laid off  palestinian workers although  palestinian workers moved with sodastream when it relocated however the israeli government refused to renew the palestinians work permits sodastream protested the government decision some news sources reported that sodastream blamed the boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds for the closing of its plant mahmoud nawajaa the bds coordinator in ramallah called the loss of palestinian jobs at sodastream part of the price that should be paid in the process of ending the occupation however sodastream ceo daniel birnbaum blamed benjamin netanyahu for the palestinian job losses according to birnbaum all of the palestinian employees had passed israeli security clearance but were nevertheless denied permits to work after netanyahu intervened birnbaum claims that netanyahu wanted the palestinians fired so he could then

member news sodastream international ltd soda is brand loyalty dead published on june   at  pm by the motley fool in news page  of next gtgtsee all “i’ll tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make sell it for a dollar it’s addictive and there’s fantastic brand loyalty” – warren buffett in  ernst and young released a study that found that consumers in developed markets were significantly less likely to make purchasing decisions based on brand loyalty younger generations of consumers were more willing to switch brands than their previous generation counterparts and were more likely to compare different product offerings online to find the best value this change in the way consumers behave could pose a potential threat to many existing businesses and pave the way for new competitors to emerge creating new opportunities in what were once thought to be dead industries sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda is one example of a company that could potentially disrupt the status quo while not a beverage maker in the traditional sense sodastream sells home sodamaking kits that allow consumers to make soft drinks themselves the consumer buys a machine that carbonates water as well as bottles of soda concentrate that are used to flavor the water to give it its soda taste while sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda is still a minor player in the beverage industry it is gaining traction revenues were up this quarter by  year over year with its primary growth drivers being the americas and western europe some feared that sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda was a fad product that would die out over time but the company has shown itself to be consistently reliable with steady growth rates in the sale of both machines and consumables additionally the company found that  of sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda owners were still using their product after one year and of those active users over  were using their machine at least once a week this shows that sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda can maintain their razorrazorblade model of selling consumers the machine first and then continually selling them the soda concentrate to make the drinks while sodastream’s growth is impressive the company is not without its risks for starters there is always the threat that a major competitor may jump into the market pepsico inc nysepep or the cocacola company nyseko could come out with their own machine at any time with very little barrier to entry and disrupt sodastream’s business entirely because cocacola or pepsi could use their own concentrates sodastream would have a tough time competing sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda also has to worry about a decline in softdrink sales altogether since  carbonated beverage sales have been declining continually and this could impact sodastream negatively sodastream may be faced with the challenge of taking a larger share out of an increasingly smaller and smaller market because sodastream’s growth is tied primarily to the us the company has to worry about a slowdown in us sales growth as the company matures it will become increasingly more difficult to grow sales and earnings at rate consistent with its past while the company still looks cheap at under  times trailing twelvemonth earnings and about  times foreword earnings investors should look out for slowing growth rates the company appears undervalued at today’s prices but given the rise in price that shares saw over recent months it may be prudent for investors to wait for a pullback before accumulating shares also benefiting from this change in consumer trends is cott corporation usa nysecot cott produces and distributes private label soft drinks throughout north america and europe and owns several brands of beverages including the nonnorth american version of rc cola while cott does have some interesting opportunities opening up it is unlikely that it will benefit much from these changes for starters cott corporation usa nysecot does not offer a compelling reason to switch beverage brands for most of their products consumers are not likely to switch from the cocacola company nyseko or pepsico inc nysepep to rc cola merely for cost savings and the brands behind any successful private label product that they manufacture are likely to be bought out by either pepsi or coke unlike sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda which offers several benefits to consumers including lower calorie drinks environmentally friendly products and convenience cott corporation usa nysecot has no advantages besides offering a marginally lower price than its name brand competitors for this reason cott corporation’s growth could be limited one area in particular however where cott corporation usa nysecot could benefit is oddly enough in sodastream’s growth sodastream international ltd nasdaqsoda announced in march a deal with cott corporation that would allow cott to manufacture sodastream flavor concentrates in the us this deal will be great for cott as it gives the company another product that will likely continue growing for years to come but even with this deal the business does not look great for starters the company has low profit margins  million in debt more than half its market cap and inconsistent earnings while the company’s free cash flow numbers look slightly better than its earnings and the company does offer a solid  yield i’m staying away there are much better companies to invest in with significantly better business models the cocacola company nyseko and pepsico inc nysepep are among the first to come to mind cocacola is among the most iconic brands the name is the second most recognized term around the world after the word “okay” but can coke’s brand overcome the change in consumer trends that are currently underway according to the  ernst and young report while western consumers are becoming increasingly less loyal to particular names emerging market consumers are becoming more likely to make their purchasing decisions based on a product’s brand this helps explain the growth of products such as the cocacola company nyseko in emerging markets while per capita consumption of cocacola products has fallen from  to  in the us worldwide consumption has increased during that same period of time per capita consumption
