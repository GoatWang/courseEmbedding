of common stock by us will be approximately  million after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full the net proceeds to us will be approximately  million we intend to use  million of the net proceeds from this offering received by us to pay a portion of the purchase price of shareplus and to contribute all but  million of the remaining net proceeds to the bank to be used for general corporate purposes other than shareplus we have no current plans arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions however at any given time we may be evaluating other acquisition candidates conducting due diligence and may have entered into one or more letters of intent we cannot assure you that we will enter into any definitive agreements in respect of any such transaction the banking business is highly competitive and our profitability will depend principally upon our ability to compete with other banks and nonbank financial institutions located in our market areas in texas for lending opportunities deposit funds bankers and acquisition candidates our banking competitors in our target markets include chase wells fargo bank of america bbva compass amegy comerica regions prosperity bank bancorpsouth independent bank texas capital and various community banks we are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from banks savings banks savings and loan associations finance companies credit unions and other providers of financial services such as money market mutual funds brokerage firms consumer finance companies assetbased nonbank lenders insurance companies and certain other nonfinancial entities including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can many of the banks and other financial institutions with which we compete have greater financial strength marketing capability and name recognition than us and operate on a statewide regional or nationwide basis these institutions are also likely to have legal loan limits substantially in excess of those that we maintain such institutions can perform certain functions for their customers including trust securities brokerage and international banking services which we presently do not offer directly although we may offer these services through correspondent banks the inability to provide such services directly may be a competitive disadvantage and this may affect our ability to generate business attract experienced bankers and capitalize on acquisition opportunities we also face competition for acquisition opportunities in connection with the implementation of our acquisition strategy because there are a limited number of acquisition opportunities in our target markets we face competition from other banks and financial institutions many of which possess greater financial human technical and other resources than we do our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of common stock in addition increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities in addition recent developments in technology and mass marketing have permitted larger companies to market loans and other products and services more aggressively to our small business customers such advantages may enable our competitors to realize greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies than we can further some of the nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the company and the bank various legislative acts in recent years have led to increased competition among financial institutions and competition from both financial and nonfinancial institutions is expected to continue we have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by providing a high level of personalized banking service to professionals and owneroperated businesses and by emphasizing quick and flexible responses to customer demands establishing longterm customer relationships and building customer loyalty and by offering products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers we rely heavily on the continued business generation of our portfolio bankers and the efforts of our officers and directors for the solicitation and referral of potential customers and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future company description we are a texas focused bank holding company headquartered in houston texas our wholly owned subsidiary green bank na a nationally chartered commercial bank provides commercial and private banking services primarily to texas based customers through twelve full service branches in the houston dallas and austin msas the houston dallas and austin msas are our target markets and we believe their growing economies and attractive demographics together with our scalable platform provide us with
