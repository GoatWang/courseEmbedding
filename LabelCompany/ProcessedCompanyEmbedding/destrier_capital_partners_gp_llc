“tlpgp” for  million in cash tlpgp is the general partner of transmontaigne partners lp “tlp” and holds the  general partner “gp” interest and incentive distribution rights “idrs” of tlp ngl expects to close the transaction by the end of january  and will use the cash proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding on its revolving credit facility mike krimbill ceo of ngl energy partners stated “i believe this is a very positive transaction for both ngl and arclight ngl will remain the longterm exclusive tenant in the tlp southeast terminal system and we look forward to our ongoing partnership with arclight arclight has been great to work with and ngl will enter into certain commercial transactions with as well as provide various transition services for arclight” “we are excited to acquire a leading refined products platform that is complementary to our recent activity in the refined product storage and logistics segment” said dan revers managing partner and cofounder of arclight “the acquisition of transmontaigne gp will mark the fourth major refined product terminals acquisition in the last twelve months and is emblematic of a concerted strategy to acquire and develop infrastructure along the refined products value chain we are also pleased to continue the longterm relationship with ngl as a significant customer and look forward to expanding the relationship as we grow the assets” the transmontaigne marketing business is a significant part of ngl’s refined products business and will remain with ngl uninterrupted by this transaction ngl will retain transmontaigne product services llc its customer contracts and its line space on the colonial and plantation pipelines with respect to the impact on ngl’s ebitda the transaction results in an increase of an estimated  million annually from cost reductions and revenue enhancements ngl will no longer receive  million of distributions associated with the idrs and gp interest it owns in tlp resulting in a net increase of about  million going forward ngl will retain approximately  million common units it owns in tlp and has granted an option to arclight to purchase  of those common units at a future date mike krimbill added “within a day period ngl will have reduced capital requirements by approximately  million through the previously announced grand mesa  saddlehorn transaction and raised  million in cash in this transaction while generating additional ebitda and dcf these recent actions provide many benefits to ngl and position it to successfully execute its growth plans in what continues to be a challenging market environment for mlps” the net sale proceeds fund ngl’s growth capital expenditures for the next  months and therefore ngl does not expect to access the debt and equity capital markets to provide such growth capital the net proceeds from this transaction will significantly reduce leverage and increase liquidity ngl can reduce leverage further through the sale of its approximately  million tlp common units ngl has no significant debt maturities until the fourth calendar quarter of  beginning in the th calendar quarter of  ngl anticipates significant additional ebitda from its grand mesa pipeline project which will further strengthen ngl’s credit profile and enhance unitholder value in conclusion this transaction positions ngl to complete its growth projects at an attractive cost of capital reduce leverage bridge to the grand mesa pipeline inservice date and continue paying its  annual common unit distribution advisors ubs investment
