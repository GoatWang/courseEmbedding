specifically to be an offensive pistol the ussocom version of the mk came paired with a laser aiming module lam and suppressor the ussocom mk was adopted by the united states special operations command ussocom for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor colts ohws development of the pistol began in  as special operations representatives identified the need for an offensive handgun weapons system—special operations peculiar and delivery of the pistols began in may  to the special operation units while the ussocom mk designation usually applies to the complete system it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone the lam and suppressor were developed by insight technology and knights armament company kac respectively the civilian version of the mk sold by itself is designated the mark  contents  overview  development  adoption  civilian mark   alternatives  users  see also  references  further reading  external links overviewedit the mk  is considered a match grade pistol and is capable of making a inch  mm group at  metres  yd the mk  is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments being waterproof and corrosionresistant it uses a polygonal barrel design which is reported to improve accuracy and durability and is much more expensive to produce it also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame the magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves a decocking lever is on the left side which will silently lower the cocked hammer the mk  is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable laser aiming module lam a suppressor and some other features such as a special highpressure match cartridge  p ammunition the firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change it remains reliable in harsh conditions making it suitable for use by special forces the  acp round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic making it suitable for use with a suppressor developmentedit in  us socom began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role studying small arms revealed that there were  types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units the logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming in response socom decided to standardize small arms among all units one area of improvement was the pistol undertaken by the offensive handgun weapon system ohws competition it would replace pistols like the  mm m which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon socoms use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons the caliber for the ohws was quickly decided not to be the nato standard  gr  g  mm due to lack of stopping power the fbi had selected the  mm auto to replace their  mm pistols but it was too powerful few manufacturers produced it and the round caused short weapon service life the  acp caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity high pressure  gr  g p loading the ohws pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the p cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo the m had been proven in service for over  years but was rejected high pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor upgrading the m would cost more than it was worth so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design a request for quote was for a system that included a pistol suppressor and laser aiming module the pistol had to be corrosion resistant have a high mean rounds between failures mrbf and be able to serve as a primary weapon after several tests heckler  koch and colt submissions were selected to move to phase i of the ohws program in august  they were awarded developmental contracts to produce  systems at the time the program was beginning hk was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the us civilian market they came up with a design that had these features including reliability durability affordability and others by february  colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the colt ohws they used an m frame that could accept a round magazine the decocking mechanism from the colt double eagle and the rotating barrel locking system from the all american  the barrel of the colt ohws could not directly attach a suppressor so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard colt was eliminated after phase i leaving only hk to move on to phase ii this phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through the requirement was for no less than  mrbf the hk ohws averaged  mrbf and could reach  mrbf three pistols went through a round endurance test and maintained accuracy of  in  mm at  meters only the oring needed replacement after  rounds the weapons worked in temperatures from  degrees fahrenheit to  degrees fahrenheit while exposed to mud ice and sand phase iii was the awarding of a production contract to hk in june  their pistol was type classified as the mark  mod  and  systems were ordered at  each all pistols were produced in germany and the first was delivered to socom on  may  even though the mark  had performed admirably several factors worked against its use previous operators were trained to fire multiple  mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier  acp rounds the introduction of the smaller and lighter hk usp political pressures and shortages of p ammunition also contributed against the pistol as the war on terror went on operators saw the effectiveness of the  acp in combat and renewed use of the mark  as well as other pistols chambered for the round adoptionedit the mk  mod  was built as an offensive handgun for us special operations forces under ussocom per request made in  military versions of the firearm have the writing mk ussocom engraved on the slide the first mk  production models were delivered to socom on may   hk commercially markets the mk  and derivatives of it but not the complete socom system the suppressor is made by knights armament company and was selected over the one hk originally included as part of its entry insight technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module later designated anpeq one version of the lam produces a visible light dot while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles there have since been different lam models and at least commercially different suppressors as well it has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem civilian mark edit heckler  koch has offered the mk  on the civilian market and law enforcement as the mark  it is distributed by its subsidiaries hk inc united states and hkjs gmbh germany the models for the us market initially came with a round magazine to comply with the us assault weapons ban the ban has now expired and the civilian mark  comes with the same round magazine as the government variants except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than  rounds in canada the mark  pistol is still supplied only with round magazines as per the  firearms act according to the operators manual there are few differences between the civilian mark  and the government mk  these differences are the slide engraving mark  which is only for the first half of the first year of production in  kg date code the rollmark mark  which is for mid  to now these instead of mk ussocom matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years tan vs black frame  tan ones were made and a barrel conforming to saami headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably alternativesedit in spite of its positive points the mk s large size and weight have resulted in some criticism the handgun was designed for offense rather than defense the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy but this also decreased its ease of use comfort and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional compact pistol in response hk developed the usp tactical pistol based on the original usp usp tactical and mk  look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose the tactical retains much of the performance of the mk  without the bulky size it uses a different suppressor due to  x mm left handed threading as opposed to  x mm righthanded on the mk  an even more compact pistol than the usp tactical for counterterrorist and special forces use is the hk usp compact tactical which has its own optional lam the uspct is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor making it a prime choice for special forces on covert operations recently hk has developed the hk  a much more contoured pistol based on the p p and p models usersedit  canada used by the peel regional police  indonesia komando pasukan katak kopaska tactical diver group and komando pasukan khusus kopassus special forces group  malaysia mk  mod

ussocom version of the mk came paired with a laser aiming module lam and suppressor the ussocom mk was adopted by the united states special operations command ussocom for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor colts ohws development of the pistol began in  as special operations representatives identified the need for an offensive handgun weapons system—special operations peculiar and delivery of the pistols began in may  to the special operation units while the ussocom mk designation usually applies to the complete system it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone the lam and suppressor were developed by insight technology and knights armament company kac respectively the civilian version of the mk sold by itself is designated the mark  contents  overview  development  adoption  civilian mark   alternatives  users  see also  references  further reading  external links overviewedit the mk  is considered a match grade pistol and is capable of making a inch  mm group at  metres  yd the mk  is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments being waterproof and corrosionresistant it uses a polygonal barrel design which is reported to improve accuracy and durability and is much more expensive to produce it also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame the magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves a decocking lever is on the left side which will silently lower the cocked hammer the mk  is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable laser aiming module lam a suppressor and some other features such as a special highpressure match cartridge  p ammunition the firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change it remains reliable in harsh conditions making it suitable for use by special forces the  acp round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic making it suitable for use with a suppressor developmentedit in  us socom began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role studying small arms revealed that there were  types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units the logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming in response socom decided to standardize small arms among all units one area of improvement was the pistol undertaken by the offensive handgun weapon system ohws competition it would replace pistols like the  mm m which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon socoms use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons the caliber for the ohws was quickly decided not to be the nato standard  gr  g  mm due to lack of stopping power the fbi had selected the  mm auto to replace their  mm pistols but it was too powerful few manufacturers produced it and the round caused short weapon service life the  acp caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity high pressure  gr  g p loading the ohws pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the p cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo the m had been proven in service for over  years but was rejected high pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor upgrading the m would cost more than it was worth so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design a request for quote was for a system that included a pistol suppressor and laser aiming module the pistol had to be corrosion resistant have a high mean rounds between failures mrbf and be able to serve as a primary weapon after several tests heckler  koch and colt submissions were selected to move to phase i of the ohws program in august  they were awarded developmental contracts to produce  systems at the time the program was beginning hk was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the us civilian market they came up with a design that had these features including reliability durability affordability and others by february  colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the colt ohws they used an m frame that could accept a round magazine the decocking mechanism from the colt double eagle and the rotating barrel locking system from the all american  the barrel of the colt ohws could not directly attach a suppressor so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard colt was eliminated after phase i leaving only hk to move on to phase ii this phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through the requirement was for no less than  mrbf the hk ohws averaged  mrbf and could reach  mrbf three pistols went through a round endurance test and maintained accuracy of  in  mm at  meters only the oring needed replacement after  rounds the weapons worked in temperatures from  degrees fahrenheit to  degrees fahrenheit while exposed to mud ice and sand phase iii was the awarding of a production contract to hk in june  their pistol was type classified as the mark  mod  and  systems were ordered at  each all pistols were produced in germany and the first was delivered to socom on  may  even though the mark  had performed admirably several factors worked against its use previous operators were trained to fire multiple  mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier  acp rounds the introduction of the smaller and lighter hk usp political pressures and shortages of p ammunition also contributed against the pistol as the war on terror went on operators saw the effectiveness of the  acp in combat and renewed use of the mark  as well as other pistols chambered for the round adoptionedit the mk  mod  was built as an offensive handgun for us special operations forces under ussocom per request made in  military versions of the firearm have the writing mk ussocom engraved on the slide the first mk  production models were delivered to socom on may   hk commercially markets the mk  and derivatives of it but not the complete socom system the suppressor is made by knights armament company and was selected over the one hk originally included as part of its entry insight technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module later designated anpeq one version of the lam produces a visible light dot while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles there have since been different lam models and at least commercially different suppressors as well it has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem civilian mark edit heckler  koch has offered the mk  on the civilian market and law enforcement as the mark  it is distributed by its subsidiaries hk inc united states and hkjs gmbh germany the models for the us market initially came with a round magazine to comply with the us assault weapons ban the ban has now expired and the civilian mark  comes with the same round magazine as the government variants except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than  rounds in canada the mark  pistol is still supplied only with round magazines as per the  firearms act according to the operators manual there are few differences between the civilian mark  and the government mk  these differences are the slide engraving mark  which is only for the first half of the first year of production in  kg date code the rollmark mark  which is for mid  to now these instead of mk ussocom matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years tan vs black frame  tan ones were made and a barrel conforming to saami headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably alternativesedit in spite of its positive points the mk s large size and weight have resulted in some criticism the handgun was designed for offense rather than defense the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy but this also decreased its ease of use comfort and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional compact pistol in response hk developed the usp tactical pistol based on the original usp usp tactical and mk  look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose the tactical retains much of the performance of the mk  without the bulky size it uses a different suppressor due to  x mm left handed threading as opposed to  x mm righthanded on the mk  an even more compact pistol than the usp tactical for counterterrorist and special forces use is the hk usp compact tactical which has its own optional lam the uspct is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor making it a prime choice for special forces on covert operations recently hk has developed the hk  a much more contoured pistol based on the p p and p models usersedit  canada used by the peel regional police  indonesia komando pasukan

capable of making a inch  mm group at  metres  yd the mk  is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments being waterproof and corrosionresistant it uses a polygonal barrel design which is reported to improve accuracy and durability and is much more expensive to produce it also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame the magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves a decocking lever is on the left side which will silently lower the cocked hammer the mk  is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable laser aiming module lam a suppressor and some other features such as a special highpressure match cartridge  p ammunition the firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change it remains reliable in harsh conditions making it suitable for use by special forces the  acp round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic making it suitable for use with a suppressor developmentedit in  us socom began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role studying small arms revealed that there were  types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units the logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming in response socom decided to standardize small arms among all units one area of improvement was the pistol undertaken by the offensive handgun weapon system ohws competition it would replace pistols like the  mm m which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon socoms use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons the caliber for the ohws was quickly decided not to be the nato standard  gr  g  mm due to lack of stopping power the fbi had selected the  mm auto to replace their  mm pistols but it was too powerful few manufacturers produced it and the round caused short weapon service life the  acp caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity high pressure  gr  g p loading the ohws pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the p cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo the m had been proven in service for over  years but was rejected high pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor upgrading the m would cost more than it was worth so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design a request for quote was for a system that included a pistol suppressor and laser aiming module the pistol had to be corrosion resistant have a high mean rounds between failures mrbf and be able to serve as a primary weapon after several tests heckler  koch and colt submissions were selected to move to phase i of the ohws program in august  they were awarded developmental contracts to produce  systems at the time the program was beginning hk was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the us civilian market they came up with a design that had these features including reliability durability affordability and others by february  colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the colt ohws they used an m frame that could accept a round magazine the decocking mechanism from the colt double eagle and the rotating barrel locking system from the all american  the barrel of the colt ohws could not directly attach a suppressor so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard colt was eliminated after phase i leaving only hk to move on to phase ii this phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through the requirement was for no less than  mrbf the hk ohws averaged  mrbf and could reach  mrbf three pistols went through a round endurance test and maintained accuracy of  in  mm at  meters only the oring needed replacement after  rounds the weapons worked in temperatures from  degrees fahrenheit to  degrees fahrenheit while exposed to mud ice and sand phase iii was the awarding of a production contract to hk in june  their pistol was type classified as the mark  mod  and  systems were ordered at  each all pistols were produced in germany and the first was delivered to socom on  may  even though the mark  had performed admirably several factors worked against its use previous operators were trained to fire multiple  mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier  acp rounds the introduction of the smaller and lighter hk usp political pressures and shortages of p ammunition also contributed against the pistol as the war on terror went on operators saw the effectiveness of the  acp in combat and renewed use of the mark  as well as other pistols chambered for the round adoptionedit the mk  mod  was built as an offensive handgun for us special operations forces under ussocom per request made in  military versions of the firearm have the writing mk ussocom engraved on the slide the first mk  production models were delivered to socom on may   hk commercially markets the mk  and derivatives of it but not the complete socom system the suppressor is made by knights armament company and was selected over the one hk originally included as part of its entry insight technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module later designated anpeq one version of the lam produces a visible light dot while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles there have since been different lam models and at least commercially different suppressors as well it has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem civilian mark edit heckler  koch has offered the mk  on the civilian market and law enforcement as the mark  it is distributed by its subsidiaries hk inc united states and hkjs gmbh germany the models for the us market initially came with a round magazine to comply with the us assault weapons ban the ban has now expired and the civilian mark  comes with the same round magazine as the government variants except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than  rounds in canada the mark  pistol is still supplied only with round magazines as per the  firearms act according to the operators manual there are few differences between the civilian mark  and the government mk  these differences are the slide engraving mark  which is only for the first half of the first year of production in  kg date code the rollmark mark  which is for mid  to now these instead of mk ussocom matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years tan vs black frame  tan ones were made and a barrel conforming to saami headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably alternativesedit in spite of its positive points the mk s large size and weight have resulted in some criticism the handgun was designed for offense rather than defense the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy but this also decreased its ease of use comfort and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional compact pistol in response hk developed the usp tactical pistol based on the original usp usp tactical and mk  look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose the tactical retains much of the performance of the mk  without the bulky size it uses a different suppressor due to  x mm left handed threading as opposed to  x mm righthanded on the mk  an even more compact pistol than the usp tactical for counterterrorist and special forces use is the hk usp compact tactical which has its own optional lam the uspct is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor making it a prime choice for special

rounds standard  rounds restricted the heckler  koch mk  mk  mod  mark  or ussocom mark  is a semiautomatic largeframe pistol chambered in  acp designed specifically to be an offensive pistol the ussocom version of the mk came paired with a laser aiming module lam and suppressor the ussocom mk was adopted by the united states special operations command ussocom for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor colts ohws development of the pistol began in  as special operations representatives identified the need for an offensive handgun weapons system—special operations peculiar and delivery of the pistols began in may  to the special operation units while the ussocom mk designation usually applies to the complete system it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone the lam and suppressor were developed by insight technology and knights armament company kac respectively the civilian version of the mk sold by itself is designated the mark  contents  overview  development  adoption  civilian mark   alternatives  users  see also  references  further reading  external links overviewedit the mk  is considered a match grade pistol and is capable of making a inch  mm group at  metres  yd the mk  is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments being waterproof and corrosionresistant it uses a polygonal barrel design which is reported to improve accuracy and durability and is much more expensive to produce it also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame the magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves a decocking lever is on the left side which will silently lower the cocked hammer the mk  is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable laser aiming module lam a suppressor and some other features such as a special highpressure match cartridge  p ammunition the firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change it remains reliable in harsh conditions making it suitable for use by special forces the  acp round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic making it suitable for use with a suppressor developmentedit in  us socom began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role studying small arms revealed that there were  types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units the logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming in response socom decided to standardize small arms among all units one area of improvement was the pistol undertaken by the offensive handgun weapon system ohws competition it would replace pistols like the  mm m which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon socoms use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons the caliber for the ohws was quickly decided not to be the nato standard  gr  g  mm due to lack of stopping power the fbi had selected the  mm auto to replace their  mm pistols but it was too powerful few manufacturers produced it and the round caused short weapon service life the  acp caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity high pressure  gr  g p loading the ohws pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the p cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo the m had been proven in service for over  years but was rejected high pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor upgrading the m would cost more than it was worth so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design a request for quote was for a system that included a pistol suppressor and laser aiming module the pistol had to be corrosion resistant have a high mean rounds between failures mrbf and be able to serve as a primary weapon after several tests heckler  koch and colt submissions were selected to move to phase i of the ohws program in august  they were awarded developmental contracts to produce  systems at the time the program was beginning hk was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the us civilian market they came up with a design that had these features including reliability durability affordability and others by february  colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the colt ohws they used an m frame that could accept a round magazine the decocking mechanism from the colt double eagle and the rotating barrel locking system from the all american  the barrel of the colt ohws could not directly attach a suppressor so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard colt was eliminated after phase i leaving only hk to move on to phase ii this phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through the requirement was for no less than  mrbf the hk ohws averaged  mrbf and could reach  mrbf three pistols went through a round endurance test and maintained accuracy of  in  mm at  meters only the oring needed replacement after  rounds the weapons worked in temperatures from  degrees fahrenheit to  degrees fahrenheit while exposed to mud ice and sand phase iii was the awarding of a production contract to hk in june  their pistol was type classified as the mark  mod  and  systems were ordered at  each all pistols were produced in germany and the first was delivered to socom on  may  even though the mark  had performed admirably several factors worked against its use previous operators were trained to fire multiple  mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier  acp rounds the introduction of the smaller and lighter hk usp political pressures and shortages of p ammunition also contributed against the pistol as the war on terror went on operators saw the effectiveness of the  acp in combat and renewed use of the mark  as well as other pistols chambered for the round adoptionedit the mk  mod  was built as an offensive handgun for us special operations forces under ussocom per request made in  military versions of the firearm have the writing mk ussocom engraved on the slide the first mk  production models were delivered to socom on may   hk commercially markets the mk  and derivatives of it but not the complete socom system the suppressor is made by knights armament company and was selected over the one hk originally included as part of its entry insight technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module later designated anpeq one version of the lam produces a visible light dot while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles there have since been different lam models and at least commercially different suppressors as well it has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem civilian mark edit heckler  koch has offered the mk  on the civilian market and law enforcement as the mark  it is distributed by its subsidiaries hk inc united states and hkjs gmbh germany the models for the us market initially came with a round magazine to comply with the us assault weapons ban the ban has now expired and the civilian mark  comes with the same round magazine as the government variants except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than  rounds in canada the mark  pistol is still supplied only with round magazines as per the  firearms act according to the operators manual there are few differences between the civilian mark  and the government mk  these differences are the slide engraving mark  which is only for the first half of the first year of production in  kg date code the rollmark mark  which is for mid  to now these instead of mk ussocom matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years tan vs black frame  tan ones were made and a barrel conforming to saami headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably alternativesedit in spite of its positive points the mk s large size and weight have resulted in some criticism the handgun was designed for offense rather than defense the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy but this also decreased its ease of use comfort and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional compact pistol in response hk developed the usp tactical pistol based on the original usp usp tactical and mk  look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose the tactical retains much of the performance of the mk  without the bulky size it uses a different suppressor due to  x mm left handed threading as opposed to  x mm righthanded on the mk  an even more compact pistol than the usp tactical for counterterrorist and special forces use is the hk usp compact tactical which has its own optional lam the uspct is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor making it a prime choice for special forces on covert operations recently hk has developed the hk  a much more contoured pistol based on the p p and p models usersedit  canada used by the peel regional police  indonesia komando pasukan

the first striker fired hk since the renowned p series pistols were introduced in the s experience gained by hk engineers with the recent p pistol had a direct influence on the design of the vp but the vp breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced hk “light pull” trigger the net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun hk pioneered the first striker fired handguns producing both the vp and p series designs that impacted several models by hk competitors but a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs the vp trigger surpasses those found on competitors it has a short light takeup with a solid single action type break followed by a short positive reset the vp trigger has a consistent pretravel pull with a positive wallcrisp break typically striker fired guns have a pretravel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke with the vp you have a less than noticeable pretravel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break the vp uses hk’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting only hk handguns have such a customized grip although influenced by other hk models the vp has all the hallmarks of the latest stateoftheart handgun all controls are completely ambidextrous slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or righthanded shooters a new feature is hk’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward the charging supports speed reloading and make operating the vp easier for shooters with reduced hand strength the vp pistols uses the proven p steel magazine  and round capacity available the vp has an extended picatinny milstd rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories the rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to  ounces the vp’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life hk’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life similar hk barrels on  mm p models have fired more than  rounds in endurance tests in  the polygonal bore profile with no traditional landsandgrooves rifling contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity the vp’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by hk’s hostile environment finish and all metal components including springs and pins have superior metallurgy vp pistols are made in heckler  koch’s oberndorf factory in southwest germany the vp is wellsuited for civilian sport shooting security military and law enforcement use covered by

by the us military in their search for a new service handgun these programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected the hk compact uses an hk proprietary oring barrel for precise barreltoslide lockup and optimal accuracy hk barrels are made using the famous hk coldhammer forging process for superior performance using hk’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as  improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life capable of firing standard  acp ball through p ammunition the hk compact has an round magazine capacity but can also use round magazines including those designed for the fullsize hk the hk combines the accuracy modularity reliability and

from hk engineers — only in a smaller more concealable design the p sk is available with law enforcement modification also known as combat defense action trigger system introduced in  on the usp compact “lem” law enforcement modification model this unique precocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired with a double action hammer system the lemcda trigger pull has been reduced to  –  pounds of pressure  –  newtons compared to  –  pounds  –  n found on many conventional double action pistols optional adjustment by an hk certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the  pound  n range using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing and in case of an ammunitionrelated failure to fire all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to recock the subcompact the enhanced lemcda trigger system combines the reliability of a doubleaction revolver trigger with the crisp precise

compact find a dealer read more the hk usp compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in  mm  sw  acp based on the fullsize usp models these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance usp compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame usps the reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “twofinger grip” frame the usp compact uses a narrow fullhand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flushfitting magazine floorplates this makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability like their large frame predecessors usp compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind using a modified linkless browningtype action the usp compact is built to take the punishment of highenergy p loads to reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the usp compact the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame usps has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing service life is still engineered to exceed  rounds easy to shoot simple to maintain the usp compact is a reliable safe accurate and highly concealable pistol features  system characteristics corrosion proof fiberreinforced polymer frame grooved target triggers polygonal bore profile for increased velocity easier cleaning and longer barrel life can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing choice of corrosion resistant “hostile

of  by matt from awesome gun ive wanted one of these for awhile now lucky sg got it for a lower price than any other site ive seen and ive seen them all the shipping took alot longer than i had hoped for but it all went well and was worth the wait its a pricey gun but you get what you pay for i wanted this one mainly as an end of the world gun being that it will last  rounds before the barrel starts to go and  rounds before it should jam and that s are a fairly common and cheap round i should be good to go if that never happens i got a great target pistol and home defence gun the mods for the gun arent easy to come by being the mk rail is only for mods made for the mk unless you get an adaptor im also gonna give you an idea as to the masive size of the pistol below ive posted pictures

larger frame p and pl pistols but in a more concealable design the completely adjustable p grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultracompact grip frame of the psk this allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user and like its larger frame counterparts the psk is available in multiple trigger firing modes including hk’s enhanced double action only “law enforcement modification lem” for the psk the lem trigger is configured with a “light strike v” setup — requiring approximately  poundsforce to pull the trigger other trigger modes include conventional double actionsingle action dasa with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame the dasa mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers like all p pistols the psk features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety an abbreviated picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights lasers or other accessories to be easily mounted all psk models have been extensively tested during a three year development process despite their small size psk subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable easy to control and
