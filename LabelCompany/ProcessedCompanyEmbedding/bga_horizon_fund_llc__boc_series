chinese local government debt problem will develop into something bigger what are your thoughts on this has this affected your positioning in the banking sectorwe think that concerns on nonperforming loan from local government financing platform are overdone there are potential bad debts from those vehicles in the coming years but the chinese banking sector has enough liquidity and provisions to cover them in addition the cashrich chinese government has capacity to absorb the losses therefore the systematic risk is very low while we seem to have a very big exposure to the financials sector this is mainly in insurance and property our actual exposure to commercials lenders in china is  as at end june we are underweight chinese banks despite their attractive valuations because there is a lack of any near term catalyst and there is clearly a near term overhang as china tries to resolve the local government debt probleminflation hit a year high of  in june where do you see it headingjune’s cpi figure was within market expectations of the  cpi growth in june  were contributed by the carryover effect of price increases last year ie inflation not due to actual price increases but on price increases in the previous year according to china’s national bureau of statistics nbs the carryover effect peaked in june and new factors that push up prices have been under the governments control regarding the outlook of inflation we think that cpi may have peaked nearterm and inflation may start weakening over the next two months driven by the governments antiinflation measures tighter liquidity and as global commodity prices cool food supply is also improving with the exception of pork which will also help ease inflation pressure however given increasing wage pressures inflation may stay elevated after peaking out in the near termchina’s purchasing managers’ index pmi an indicator of growth fell further to  in june does this raise concerns about china’s growtha reading above  indicates that the economy is still in expansion mode and despite the tightening policies china’s q gdp growth announced on  july came in at  we think that an imminent hard landing is highly unlikely because even against the backdrop of monetary tightening there are indications that the government is loosening their stance on targeted areas of the economy to support growth the authorities are stepping up on social housing construction efforts in the second half of the year in order to meet their target of beginning construction of  million subsidized homes by the end of october they have also finalised a series of income tax reforms on  june this year that is a boost to the consumption story in the long runwhat is the impact of the income tax reformon the back of proposed tax reforms effective september  china’s personal income tax exemption threshold will be lifted from rmbmth to rmbmth according to china’s ministry of finance this is expected to reduce the number of personal income tax payers from  million to  million the tax reform should benefit the lowermiddle income group and soften the impact of inflationary pressure medium to longer term there could also be a mild positive impact on the consumer sector certainly it is beneficial towards china’s aim to narrow income inequality and boost consumption in china in the long term on the fiscal side the new tax code is expected to reduce fiscal revenue in  by just  and will have little or no impact on china’s fiscal spending plansinflation domestic tightening and growth concerns have weighed on chinese equities for the first half of the year what is your outlook for the second halfmarket sentiment remains fragile for now given the longdrawn battle with inflation and the uncertainty in growth outlook however we think that investors can look forward to a more upbeat second half in light of a more positive inflation outlook fixed asset investment growth will be supported by massive efforts to begin construction of  million units of social housing this year and consumption remains robust we expect ongoing tightening will be carried forward less aggressively as well as policymakers remain cautious about the negative impact of aggressive rate hikes chinas economy is only slowing gently and is still seen growing by more than  in  therefore despite the noise in the market we believe that there is room for optimism in chinese equities especially at the current levels x  pe they are trading athow is the henderson horizon fund – china fund positioned at the momentwe increased our overweight to consumer discretionary stocks from  in may to  in june having participated in prada’s ipo as we like their exposure to the booming luxury goods consumption story in asia and also see potential for further operating margin improvement in their business we also raised our stake in brilliance china automotive bmw’s manufacturer in china for the same reason another new holding is in gome electrical post restructuring the company is refocusing on store expansion driving growth and margin improvementin terms of the other sectors the fund’s biggest exposure is to financials though mainly in insurance and property we are underweight banks as mentioned earlier we continue to like materials as strong fixed asset investment growth provides solid support to earnings one of our bigger bets in this sector is in bbmg a building materials manufacturer which stands to benefit from the massive social housing projects our biggest shorts remain in hong kong utilities and telecoms companies that are overvalued for their earnings growth prospectswill you consider reducing the fund’s long exposure or buying put options at this pointwe are unlikely to do so given the current valuations while market sentiment is fragile chinese equities have been range bound and close to flat for nearly  years we think that over the near term especially in view of a more subdued inflation outlook the possibility of further upside outweighs the risks of a hefty correction in the markettemasek holdings recently reduced their stakes in bank of china boc and china construction bank ccb what do you think prompted that movewe would not try to read too much from temasek’s disposal we do not think it is because they have a particularly bearish view on the chinese banking sector and it seemed more like an investment decision to rebalance their portfolio after trimming their stakes in the two lenders for us billion temasek still holds about us billion of ccbs shares and about us billion of bocs stock in a statement that was made during a press briefing later temasek reiterated that “we have faith in the policies of the chinese government in the long term and we are bullish on china in the long term” about  of the temasek’s portfolio is still invested in chinawhy are you short in mtrthe company’s core railway operation is steady and defensive however this accounts for less than  of its net asset value nav the rest of its nav is contributed by its property development and property investment businesses which contributed to a significant portion of

china hong kong and taiwan and may also invest in companies incorporated elsewhere that have significant assets business production trading activity or other interests in china hong kong or taiwanthe fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in companies in china emerging market which may involve a higher concentration of risk and also may experience higher risks of economic political regulatory and social development changes investments in emerging market may be less liquid and more volatile than funds that invest in developed and more geographically diversified markets the fund uses trading strategies that use financial derivative instruments “fdi” which may be unsuccessful due to a number of reasons including volatile market conditions imperfect correlation between the movements in securities on which derivatives are based lack of liquidity within markets and counterparty default risk the fund typically holds long and short positions mainly through the use of fdi combining with direct investments and its total gross market exposure may exceed  such investment strategy and the use of fdi are inherently volatile and depending on market condition the fund could potentially be exposed to additional risk and costs should the market move against it and incur losses consequentlyinvestments in the fund involve varying degree of investment risks eg market legal
