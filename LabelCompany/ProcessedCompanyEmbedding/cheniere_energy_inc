premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search cheniere energy inc buy at the high the lng export company is riding high thanks to robust growth and rising optimism matthew dilallo tmfmd may   at pm cheniere energy nysemktlng and its two affiliates cheniere energy partners holding nysemktcqh and cheniere energy partners nysemktcqp have been riding high this year with all three stocks recently touching week highs fueling that bullish buying is a combination of factors including cheniere energys robust firstquarter results and reports that it is in talks to increase liquefied natural gas shipments to china all this bullishness certainly raises the question of whether investors should wait for a pullback before investing in cheniere or one of its affiliates while that patience might pay off if there is a selloff investors who look at the bigger picture might still want to buy even though the stock is at the high image source getty images the trains are just starting to roll out cheniere energy is in the midst of a transformation from an lng project developer into a global lng exporting powerhouse driving that shift is the startup of commercial operations at the first of its sabine pass liquefaction trains last november it has since completed two more trains that should start commercial deliveries later this year in the interim these trains combined to load  lng cargoes during the first quarter which includes seven commissioning cargos those shipments enabled cheniere and its affiliates to record  billion in revenue in the quarter which is a stratospheric rise for a franchise that only produced  million in revenue during last years first quarter meanwhile cheniere recorded  million in adjusted ebitda a remarkable amount for a company that posted a negative  million in adjusted ebitda during last years first quarter those strong results are only the beginning thats because it didnt start commercial activities on train  until the end of the quarter meanwhile cheniere just started commissioning activities on its newest expansion train  which it expects to complete later this year because of that staggered start revenue and earnings should steadily rise for the next few years from these four trains alone however sabine pass is just the first of its lng export developments cheniere also has a project at corpus christi under construction with the first of its two trains expected to enter service in the first half of  and  respectively meanwhile it has another train at sabine pass that should enter service in late  once all those trains come on line cheniere will be the fifthlargest lng export company in the world that said it still has more expansions in development including another fully permitted train at both sabine pass and corpus christi and it recently bought land adjacent to corpus christi to develop two more trains  image source getty images capturing a colossal opportunity the company has most of its financial growth locked up since it has signed year takeorpay contracts with customers for  of total capacity which includes trains both completed and under construction however while it intends to hold back at least  of capacity to capture opportunities in the spot market it would jump at the chance to sign additional capacity to longterm contracts  thats where recent news that cheniere has had extensive negotiations with china about increasing lng shipments to the country might prove to be another catalyst for the stock to date it has sold nine cargos to china since it started exporting gas last february though all were spot market volumes as part of its commissioning process ideally cheniere would like to secure longterm contracts with china for some of its available capacity as well as for the trains it hasnt started constructing because theyre not yet fully commercialized  china would be an ideal destination for this capacity given that its expected to drive lng demand growth over the next decade according to a report from leading lng producer royal dutch shell nyserdsanyserdsb global lng demand should rise  to  annually through  driven in large part by chinas desire to boost lng imports as a percentage of its energy mix from  to  if that were to happen china would represent  of total global lng demand according to shell because of that forecast the country represents an enormous untapped market opportunity for cheniere  investor takeaway cheniere energy is riding high these days thanks to the stunning growth it has experienced since completing its first three lng trains that said it still has unprecedented growth ahead of it given the trains it still has under construction and in development which would only heighten if it can finally start making inroads into the rapidly growing chinese market because of this investors who buy at the high could still be rewarded handsomely by holding for the long term and letting the thesis play out matt dilallo has no
