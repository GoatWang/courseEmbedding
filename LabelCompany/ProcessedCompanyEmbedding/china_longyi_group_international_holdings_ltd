research has shown that under certain biological conditions sod revitalizes cells and reduces the rate of cell destruction it neutralizes the most common free radicalsuperoxide radicalby converting it into hydrogen peroxide and water because superoxide is harmful to human cells and certain forms of sod exist naturally in most humans many studies show that sod is valuable in protecting human cells from the harmful effects of superoxide sod is thought to be more powerful than antioxidant vitamins as it activates the bodys productions of its own antioxidants as a result sod is referred to as the enzyme of life commercially sod has a wide range of applications and is widely applied in foods drinks skin care productions pharmaceuticals to combat ailments ranging from sunburn to rheumatoid arthritis  second quarter of  financial performance highlights the following are some financial highlights for the three months ended june    revenue  revenue increased  to  for the three

rate of  no provision for income taxes in the united states has been made as china longyi group international holding limited had no income subject to united states taxation in the second quarter of       british virgin islands  our wholly owned subsidiary top team holdings limited was incorporated in the british virgin islands or the bvi and under the current laws of the bvi is not subject to income taxes        china  before the implementation of the enterprise income tax or eit foreign invested enterprises or fies established in the prc were generally subject to an eit rate of  which includes a  state income tax and a  local income tax on march   the national peoples congress of china passed the new corporate income tax law or eit law and on november   the state council of china passed the implementing rules for the eit law or implementing rules which took effect on january   the eit law and implementing rules impose a unified eit of  on all domestic invested enterprises and fies unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions therefore nearly all fies are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the old tax laws applicable to fies and its associated preferential tax treatments beginning january     despite these pending changes the eit law gives the fies established before march   or old fies such as our subsidiaries beijing sod and chongqing sod a fiveyear grandfather period during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments during this fiveyear grandfather period the old fies which enjoyed tax rates lower than  under the original eit law shall gradually increase their eit rate by  per year until the tax rate reaches  in addition the old fies that are eligible for the twoyear exemption and threeyear half reduction or fiveyear exemption and fiveyear halfreduction under the original eit law are allowed to remain to enjoy their preference until these holidays expire the discontinuation of any such special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an adverse effect on any organizations business fiscal condition and current operations in china  in addition to the changes to the current tax structure under the eit law an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to a eit of  on its global income the implementing rules define the term de facto management bodies as an establishment that exercises in substance overall management and control over the production business personnel accounting etc of a chinese enterprise if the prc tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident
