operating officer dan woods took a break from his increasingly packed schedule to answer our burning questions about this expanding business q how has the increasing popularity of the maker movement impacted and influenced techshop from a business perspective from a business perspective the growth of the maker movement has allowed techshop to embrace economies of scale as techshop expands we are able to invest more money in education content and tools in addition there is a fascinating scale with members with a smaller number of members techshop is mostly a place to access tools but as the membership grows there is a critical point – around  members – where members start coming in because they want to experience the community and see their friends that is also the point where as a business we have enough members to hire a staff do maintenance and make sure we can pay for health insurance q how does techshop choose what type of equipment and tools will be available in a location techshop provides members access to just about every machine tool and process that you can imagine including milling machines and lathes laser cutters sheet metal equipment welding equipment woodworking equipment plastics working equipment hand tools a d printer computercontrolled vinyl cutter sewing machines design software and lots more the exact number of each type of tool varies from shop to shop based on the number of members and demand for each tool this x cnc shopbot router is one of three available in the woodworking area oftechshops midpeninsula location in california the shopbot cuts parts objects or art designedin d or d cad and works with most woods plastics foams and other composites q how does techshop choose which products to select from a large range with different functions at the end of the day we select equipment that allows us to meet the evolving needs of our members one of our strengths is our ability to leverage the depth of experience of our  talented staff members who help us identify advantages – and sometimes pitfalls – of certain equipment in the hands of makers with skills ranging from beginner to expert obviously when meeting the needs of more than  members reliability serviceability availability and uptime are critical considerations its also important to note that our members privileges extend across all of our locations so we standardize machinery as much as possible q could you share any stories of how techshop positively impacted a community or an individual there is a long list of stories about techshop creating a platform for education community development learning and economic development one of the most compelling stories is that of marc roth marc was living in a homeless shelter in san francisco when he found a business card for techshop in a garbage can he came in for a free tour and spent  on a one month membership and class deal we had at the time he spent  to  hours a day studying the tools in the shop and quickly became an expert within six months marc was supporting himself as a techshop instructor and parttime helper for other members within  months he had started sf laser making  an hour for production laser cutting and etching now marc is developing a program to teach handson industrialhardware skills to homeless individuals and provide housing and volunteer mentors called the learning shelter q have there been any concerns or criticisms when a new techshop location is proposed weve seen a few hackerspaces and makerspaces who express some concern when they first learn that techshop is planning to open a new location in their community initially they see a new squarefoot workspace with  million worth of new machinery and tools as a threat in reality nothing is further from the truth the world needs more makerspaces not fewer we fill an important role in the makerspace landscape that no one else is doing on a global scale we provide an open space where everyone is welcome regardless of skill level or background access to a broad spectrum of leading edge tools and machinery a community of helpful and spirited makers and hundreds of classes taught every month by paid professionals q what would you like people to know about techshop techshop is for more than just hobbyists and engineers anyone can come into techshop and learn the skills they need to use tools and build what they want in a short period of time even without any background knowledge q what is the biggest misconception about techshop weve had a tremendous amount of publicity around businesses that were launched around products developed at techshop such as square were very much fueling the birth of new companies and jobs but we want aspiring and novice makers to know that the majority of techshop members are here because of their love of making techshop is filled with people from all walks of life who bring a richly diverse range of interests skills and ideas q can you mention any companies that have participated in techshops experiencedriven corporate events this is actually one of the fastest growing parts of techshops business whether its classic oneday team building events holiday parties or more intensive weeklong innovation workshops we hold hundreds of corporate and group events annually our clients include google cisco nike apple intuit dell and dozens of other companies q are there any community programs or fundraising efforts that techshop supports sure we have a partnership with making it in america where we provide membership and training to underemployed and unemployed trade union members in pennsylvania we also have a program – generously sponsored by ge and the va center for innovation – that provides membership and training to veterans and each of our locations provides workshop access and time to support deserving local school groups and other community causes q why offer free coffee and popcorn and is that at all

imposed sanctions on the officials it held responsible for his death passing the magnitsky act in  russian president vladimir putin’s government retaliated among other ways by suspending american adoptions of russian children natalia veselnitskaya the russian lawyer who secured a meeting with donald trump jr jared kushner and paul manafort was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the magnitsky act and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting that’s put the spotlight back on browder’s long campaign for kremlin accountability and against corruption—a campaign whose success has irritated putin and those around him continue reading aaron bernstein  reuters the limits of bullying adam serwer trump’s opponents have often been accused of naïveté for their appeals to norms and civility but early friday morning at least that faith was rewarded after donald trump implied ted cruz’s wife was ugly and accused his father of helping to kill president john f kennedy cruz still worked the phones for him trump humiliated “liddle” marco rubio who endorsed trump anyway trump implied ben carson was a child molester and then appointed him to his cabinet trump ran a campaign in which he exhorted audiences to call for hillary clinton’s imprisonment and she showed up to his inauguration trump rose to prominence by questioning whether the first black president was even american and won the opportunity to destroy a huge part of that president’s legacy all of that made former first lady michelle obama’s memorable line about going high when the other side goes low seem

past seven years is dead again deader than ever brought down by republicans themselves in the face of nearly unanimously hostile public opinion democratic constituencies have been mobilized to an intensity not seen since the worst days of the iraq war they have crowded town halls and barraged senators with phone calls and messages the party’s serious internal differences—including over the future of health care—have been laid aside for the time republican constituencies have been split and demoralized working and middleclass republicans have been put on notice their party wanted to cut their medicaid and other healthcare benefits why should they show up in november to vote for more of that upmarket republicans have been formally informed their party was duping them on obamacare repeal in all those years of yammering it never developed anything like an alternative the obamacare taxes will remain in place as will the law’s other costs and burdens why should they show up in

talk about almost anything else hillary clinton’s presidential campaign dirty rap lyrics—anything donors are hearing that funds donated to the republican national committee and other party funds have been used to pay the personal legal bills of the supposedly superrich trump family—and that more such spending is probably on the way the special counsel’s investigation is triggering more and more erratic behavior from the president trump has repeatedly and publicly denounced his own attorney general—the one cabinet secretary executing a policy generally popular with the party’s conservative

on the ballot in california where the president’s approval rating has tumbled to  percent down five points since inauguration day there are  more in new jersey where governor chris christie’s approval rating has plunged to  percent the  senate map favors republicans but the president has gone out of his way to tie the single most imperiled republican incumbent nevada’s dean heller tightly to him

things are going well otherwise his tenure as communications director might not be off to a great start thursday began with scaramucci giving a preposterous interview to cnn—cutting off a segment with new yorker journalist ryan lizza—in which he accused white house chief of staff reince priebus of leaking to the press suggested he is trying to “save america from this president” and likened his own relationship with priebus to that of the biblical figure cain and to abel the brother he slew the day closed with lizza writing his own devastating account of a deranged conversation he’d had with scaramucci wednesday night after lizza reported on a dinner scaramucci had with fox news personalities past and present politico had also published scaramucci’s financial disclosure obtained by a

graphic speech friday the president threatened to track down and deport gang members in the united states but the administration’s overall strategy isn’t clear president trump flew to new york friday to talk about “liberating” long island from ms trump has often used the gang its bloody tactics and its ties to central america to push his immigration policies and the picture he painted friday was one of long island as a war zone ms trump said has “transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields” he said the gang members “stomp on their victims” “slash at them with machetes” and stab them with knives to “every gang member and criminal alien” trump threatened “we will find you arrest you we will jail you and we will deport you” in the past  months the gang has been implicated in  murders in long island it’s also made gory headlines in maryland and northern virginia all of which are home to large central american populations but while ms
