imperio systems home company overview management news technology markets industrial water oil and gas agriculture and livestock brackish well water sea water faq contact brackish well water brackish water has a salinity lower than seawater but it is too salty to be able to be consumed by people or animals and its use tends to lower crop yields it is found in marshes and estuaries where fresh water mixes with seawater it is also found in underground aquifers below fresh water aquifers texas for example is blessed with an abundance of brackish water aquifers prime for development mi systems hope to prove their capabilities in the state of texas and then expand that market to the rest of the united states – and to the world previous project next project magna imperio systems is committed

and gas  magna imperio systems home company overview management news technology markets industrial water oil and gas agriculture and livestock brackish well water sea water faq contact oil and gas there are several ways the upstream oil  gas industry uses fresh water one of the most obvious is the requirement for potable water on offshore facilities this is currently provided by reverse osmosis ro units removing the salt from sea water however this industry also requires fresh water for the following to drill mud used in well construction drill water to mix chemicals for well treatments such as gels and acids to improve the efficiency of some processes such as crude desalting and to remove some salts from sea water to inject into the oil reservoirs for pressure maintenance low salinity water injection this represents a huge worldwide market another upstream oil  gas market that represents a more suitable entry point for mi systems is the management of onshore water production– especially in the united states the recent significant increase in us oil production is a result of horizontal fracturing technology however these fracturing jobs require copious amounts of water – often millions of gallons when this water flows back in it contains a cocktail of chemicals that requires proper disposal however this frac flowback water is only a small portion of the water management challenges facing oil  gas operators the salt water that is native to most oil reservoirs is produced with the oil over time this water cut can be as much as  of the total fluids produced by an oil well although the salts in this produced water vary widely in chemical composition and salinity levels this produced water is usually considered to be a hazardous waste and must be handled and disposed of accordingly in texas for example this water is usually piped or hauled to a water disposal well for reinjection back into the ground because of seismic events caused by saltwater injection the citizens of oklahoma are pushing for a ban on new water disposal wells the states of ohio and arkansas do not allow any produced water reinjection and as a result water must be hauled out of state for disposal this described water reinjection and transport represents significant operating costs for producers when the price of oil dropped drastically in  many producers had to shut down their wells or produce at a loss this is a huge market it is estimated that the current onshore water handling requirement in the us is approximately  billion gallons per year texas alone injected some  billion gallons of water last year the fact that mi system’s technology can be easily designed for a variety of water types as well as being relatively small and portable makes it well suited for the oil  gas market previous project next project magna imperio systems is committed to redefining water treatment at the nexus of water and energy contact us site navigationhome company

systems are passionate about our company and its technology we are currently designing and manufacturing our prototype  of the desalination cell designed and initially developed by grant page we have been able to meet some very demanding design requirements while also keeping costs lower than initially anticipated this prototype will allow us to quickly test various process parameters with multiple chambers it also has more versatile scaleup capabilities than the version  prototype we have established our office in houston and will be hiring about half a dozen permanent employees we have sublet some office and manufacturing from ofi testing equipment this is truly a winwin situation for both companies due to the drastic fall in oil prices ofite has some excess space and organizational capacity we are able to plug into this is a first class space with a truly first class organization ofite is providing a variety of “infrastructure capabilities” to mi systems – including furniture phones printers it support osha compliance safety programs security shipping  receiving and material handling on the business development side we continue to market our technology in our target industry – upstream oil  gas mi systems personnel are making presentations to oil companies and at professional society meetings as predicted we are also feeling significant pull from

home company overview management news technology markets industrial water oil and gas agriculture and livestock brackish well water sea water faq contact industrial water industries including those of chemical plants aerospace manufacturing power plants mining operations as well as other facilities using boilers and other machinery require proper water treatment these industries use large quantities of water in their processes or for cooling their product streams usually they require clean desalinated water to run operations while also generating waste water that must be managed appropriately more than  of all pollutants from these industrial operations are emitted into water the removal of these contaminants prior to discharge is receiving significant attention and is often regulated by various governmental authorities it is critical that discharges of toxic components into the environment be limited with discharge requirements becoming more stringent noncompliance is being penalized more frequently and more heavily with industrial plants under operating cost pressures mi systems end technology can retrofit existing wastewater systems to provide a more efficient

markets industrial water oil and gas agriculture and livestock brackish well water sea water faq contact technology electrochemical nano diffusion end our proprietary electrochemical nano diffusion end technology gives mi systems a competitive advantage in the desalination market the electrodesalination process itself requires very little energy our units are capable of internally generating enough energy to monitor the health and efficiency of the process depending on the water quality the only external energy that may be required is that which is used to pump salt water into the unit the process is operated at a low pressure this means that any external energy required for pumping is relatively low additionally no highpressure components are required making the unit low in both cost and weight units are comprised of stackable cells this means that units are easily configured to specific customer requirements with minimal design effort the mi systems end process is an ingenious combination of an electrochemical and concentration cell technology it resembles an electrochemical process in that there are variations of anodes and cathodes it resembles a concentration cell in that it creatively extracts the potential energy from salinity gradients the target design life of the end water treatment cell is  years how it works the end technology captures the energy hidden in the processing of the electrodes salt ions and other elements to drive the process the key to the process are the membranes which have pores in the range of several nanometers  billionth of a meter the membranes separate the product and brine streams in the electrodesalination cell the treated product stream and the high molarity brine stream the porous membranes selectively allow either cations or anions to pass through beneficially removing them from the product stream the end electrodes spacers and concentration gradient provides a mechanism to deliver product water at low energy by minimizing the internal resistances in addition due to the unique combination of our novel process design and novel power profiles scalingfouling of the membranes is greatly reduced resulting in longer life without chemical addition as compared to traditional membrane filtration technologies advantages of the “end” process the end desalination process yields several advantages over traditional reverse osmosis desalination end has an extremely low energy footprint end has a very high process recovery reverse osmosis can produce as low as  gallons of fresh water for every  gallons of salt water input whereas end typically yields greater than  gallons of fresh water for every  gallons of salt water or contaminated water unit the end process operates at a low pressure which allows us to implement lower complexity and lower pressure components the end desalination unit is designed to require minimal maintenance during its targeted  year lifespan the process is automated
