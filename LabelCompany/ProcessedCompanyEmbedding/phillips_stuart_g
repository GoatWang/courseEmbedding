your hair healthy with quality hair care productsfor some women and men taking care of the hair involves many steps to have and maintain a healthy head of hair there are many products available to help you accomplish just that shampoos conditioners styling and cutting tools hair brushes and much more all might become part of your daily ritual to keep your hair looking good with low prices every day on everything you can get the hair care supplies you need for less heres how to figure out what you needshampoosno matter what type of hair you have theres a shampoo just for you there are shampoos specific to mens womens and childrens hair other hair conditions that shampoo can improve include dandruff oily hair or frizzy hair if you have dry or damaged hair there are hydrating shampoos that can reverse the damage fine thin hair is easy to protect and improve through the use of shampoos designed to add volume and texture for simplicity there are also shampoos and conditioners combined into one productconditionersconditioners help maintain various types of hair as well if you have colortreated hair it helps to use a conditioner that maintains the color and retains the treatment longer all types of hair can benefit from the proper conditioner including curly frizzy thick long straight dry oily and fine hair some conditioners are those that you massage into your hair then rinse out immediately some you massage in and leave in for a few minutes there are even some conditioners that require you to leave them in overnight especially if you have damaged or heatstyled hairhair coloring productswhen choosing hair coloring products the two most common reasons are to change the color of your hair or to address a specific issue such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair although hair coloring can be gender and agespecific most people can use any type of hair coloring some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color much like youd with shampoo when coloring your hair the time involved is directly related to how much youre changing the color if youre just changing your shade slightly the time involved is minimal however if youre going dark brown to light blonde for example there are several steps involved and a great deal of time involved there are also temporary hair colors you can add in representing many assorted colors including those not normally found on hair that naturally wash out after several showersstyling productsprobably no tool is more important when it comes to styling hair than the hair dryer these powerful devices allow you to both blow dry your hair and style it at the same time hair dryers reduce the amount of time it takes to dry your hair by a great deal hair dryers are available by the amount of wattage they use and what type of accessories they have many hair dryers run on  watts but can have fewer than  watts and more than  watts if you use curlers or prefer that salonlike feeling while at home there are also bonnetstyle hair dryers that cover your head completelya couple of other key styling tools for hair are curling irons and flat irons although they work much the same way one makes small or large curls and the other one flattens and straightens hair both with heat both types of irons are available in varied sizes with most being between  of an inch to  inches wide larger sizes work best on thicker hairother hair care productsall of the styling you want to do with your hair is much easier with a good hair brush or comb to remove tangles and smooth things out some common types include natural synthetic and mixed bristle brushes that are either paddle vented round teasing or wet brushes bristle brushes are good for using with long hair and synthetic or mixed bristle brushes dont create as much static as natural bristle brushes natural bristle brushes are soft and help spread your hairs natural oils throughout your hair making it look shinypaddle brushes are flat and wide and work well when doing a blowout on your hair vented brushes with their increased airflow help cut down drying time even more round brushes also work well when doing a blowout and help create extra volume teasing brushes allow you to tease the ends of your hair in different styles for more volume rattail combs make it easier for you to section hair for braids and other styles widetooth combs are easier on your hair when its wet and reduce breakagefor holding hair in place you can use barrettes
