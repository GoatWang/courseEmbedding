great ideas to thrive we’re a global charitable foundation both politically and financially independent we support scientists and researchers take on big problems fuel imaginations and spark debate watch our video about the power of asking questions we value breadth and depth in the activities we support we remain true to the vision and values of our founder sir henry wellcome a medical entrepreneur collector and philanthropist our work today reflects the amazing breadth of henrys interests and his belief that science and research expand knowledge by testing and investigating ideas our governance is based on an updated version of his will our funding supports over  people in more than  countries in the next five years we aim to spend up to £ billion helping thousands of curious passionate people all over the world explore ideas in science population health medical innovation the humanities and social sciences and public engagement for example one of the world’s biggest challenges is how to be better prepared for the next major epidemic we take on this problem in many different ways – here are just a handful vaccine development such as when we cofunded the development of a new ebola vaccinepublic health interventions such as insecticidetreated bednets for malariabehavioural projects such as training health workers to reduce risk of infection while working on the frontlinesocial science including research into the ethics of medical trials involving pregnant women of urgent importance because of the zika virusdeveloping research leaders in regions most affected by infectious disease as we’ve done through our deltas africa initiativeadvocacy encouraging governments and global businesses to take part in building a more secure future for global healthwe bring these activities together to make a difference when we can we bring together different people and strands of activity to create something greater than the sum of its parts sometimes that means backing an idea in the laboratory and then helping it develop into a new treatment or approach to patient care for example the idea for how to prevent mitochondrial disease – a devastating genetic illness passed from mother to child – came after years of scientific research to understand the basic biology of mitochondria and what happens when they don’t work properly the development of new ivf techniques for preventing it followed and our policy and campaign work to promote change means that uk law now allows these techniques to be considered for use at other times we take an interdisciplinary approach from the start the hub for example is a specially designed space where researchers and other creative minds can collaborate created out of mind a group exploring dementia are our hub residents until  a network including scientists artists clinicians public health experts and broadcasters will examine and challenge perceptions of dementia through scientific and creative experiments collaborations and public events we can take the long view while also acting flexibly we have a £bn investment portfolio which funds all the work we do this allows us to plan for the longterm while having the independence to act flexibly and responsively weve funded the wellcome trust sanger institute since  it played a key role in the human genome project mapping  of the human dna sequence as part of an international collaboration our backing kept the results public which meant researchers could freely – and permanently – access the data today the wellcome trust sanger institute continues to be a world leader in genome research we run wellcome collection a free destination in central london that’s open to everyone wellcome collection is also the home of wellcome library one of the world’s best resources for the study of medical history these longterm investments – and many others – ensure discoveries and knowledge are freely available to all for generations to comewe work with others to reach our goals we work with academia philanthropy business governments and civil society around the world with this network of people and partner

complementary approaches across science research and engagement with society it builds on our  strategic plan and has no fixed timeframe it includes six initial priority areas it allows us to adapt as new ideas and challenges arise drawing on insights from  years of achievement and our broad network of experts it also allows us to respond quickly in a crisis as we did to support new vaccines for ebola find out more about our philosophy and the strategic framework below or read more about how they shape what we do our philosophy good health makes life better we want to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive science and research expand knowledge by testing and investigating ideas this new understanding can be applied to health and change medicine behaviour and society that’s why we support thousands of curious passionate people all over the world to explore great ideas at every step of the way from discovery to impact together we can do more we can drive reform to ensure that ideas can reach their full potential and we can give focused intensive support when we see real opportunities to transform lives as an independent charitable foundation we’re willing to take risks we combine the ability to act swiftly with longterm ambition that’s how we make life better  advancing ideas better health needs great new ideas the richest sources of these ideas are the people who dedicate themselves to discovery creativity and innovation we are always open to proposals and ready to respond to the best supporting ideas has always been central to our approach and it will always account for the majority of our funding we also stimulate ideas and pursue many of our own the research we support continues to address fundamental health challenges of our time across discovery science medical innovation and the humanities and social sciences we give grants to people and teams and for places and resources as well as providing seed funding through our recently updated set of funding schemes we support researchers at the start of a career and at every stage that follows as well as creative people teachers and others who put health and science at the heart of everyday conversation we develop leaders and advocate policy change and we can adapt our support quickly and flexibly to meet fresh needs at times of unexpected opportunity or challenge  seizing opportunities we’ve long supported people with great ideas and we always will beyond that we identify times when our concerted intervention can accelerate progress towards better health we do this by providing focused intensive support that creates a step change over five to ten years sometimes we see potential in connecting people we support at other times we will stimulate a new field of endeavour or invest in new technology that drives discovery in each case we identify a critical need and set ambitious goals we connect experts from different research disciplines build partnerships and lead advocacy policy development communications and public engagement the challenges we choose to pursue are often tough and complex not every effort will succeed but those that do will transform lives we’ve identified four priority areas drugresistant infections our planet our health research ecosystems in africa and asia and vaccines  driving reform we have learned so much from the people and organisations we work with around the world this helps us to recognise practices that enable ideas to reach their full potential – and barriers that stand in their way our record in areas like open access to research results public engagement and research careers has earned us the credibility to challenge ways of working and to propose better alternatives we will promote change – leading by example convening alliances and campaigning for wider reform we can move quickly to address an urgent challenge or think long to build lasting agreement we’ve identified two priority areas diversity and inclusion and improving science education  see it all come together in this short animation introducing the wellcome trust’s philosophy and strategic approach get involved we hope you’re as
