exponential growth in technology is enhancing our lives and enabling us to master the art of international engagement things have never looked better or have they in many ways our situation today mirrors the one in which we found ourselves after world war ii as we were then we are now  the sole superpower dominant in the world marketplace militarily without peer  the only nation capable of winning a war anywhere on the planet just as we did then we now face important decisions concerning the defense structure with which we will maintain our place in the world and ensure our continued security in  with no clear threat we felt safe in setting aside a significant amount of our military capability to use the money elsewhere today we again have difficulty discerning our threats and once again ponder the nations needs with respect to military forces but in the decade after world war ii we came to learn that much in the world required our use of force we learned it the hard way when we committed a hollow force to the korean peninsula we learned then as perhaps we are learning now that one clear victory  in war or in cold war  cannot protect our worldwide interests or relieve us of our responsibility of vigilance against the dark forces of this world this comparative analysis leads us to the question of our day how should we build and maintain our national security posture for the st century the answer lies in the expectations we have of our forces and of the use of those forces to define these expectations we must answer three questions why will we fight where will we

these challenges will be the result of a world that is currently undergoing a metamorphosis today we see numerous emerging countries experiencing enormous economic growth with this new economic growth comes a commensurate ability to procure military power the diffusion of technology and a burgeoning world arms market make available for procurement some of the latest high tech weaponry and for those who desire them possibly even weapons of mass destruction at the same time we see this shifting balance in economic and military power we continue to see the worlds resources becoming more scarce the competition for them always has been and always will be a dominating theme in international relations this mix of emerging economies competition for resources and new military might is a proven recipe

ceo andy groves described how his business faced radical changes and not only survived but prospered whether a company became a winner or a loser was related to its degree of adaptability the key factor is recognizing and taking advantage of strategic inflection points he described a strategic inflection point as a time in the life of a business when its fundamentals are about to change  they are fullscale changes in the way business is conducted so that simply adopting new technology or fighting the competition as you used to may be insufficient the joint strategic review quadrennial defense review and national defense panel each indicated that the armed forces have reached a strategic inflection point in the area of national security the next century promises to be a time when emerging technologies coupled with an agile mindset will if exploited fundamentally alter and substantially increase our warfighting capability despite the recent downturn in asian economies leading economists continue to predict that by  both china and india will emerge as trading superpowers and the global economic center of gravity will shift from west to east in that same year eight of the ten largest economies will lie around the rim of the pacific and indian oceans almost every nation is becoming interdependent in the global marketplace they compete for scarce resourcesnotably oilto maintain economic expansion such growth is increasing the ability of emerging states to respond to security threats militarily with hightech systems and weapons of mass destruction history has

success drake baer tech insider mar    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print shannon stapleton  reuters after general charles c krulak became commandant — the highestranking position within the marine corps — in  he decided that the corps needed to change the way it turned young people into marines they were fighting in places like somalia and iraq where combat was constantly changing — and they had to make lifeendangering decisions in real time  the corps needed extreme selfstarters he told charles duhigg in his new book smarter faster better the secrets of being productive in life and business but at the time recruits coming in lacked any sense of direction or drive krulak said all they knew was doing the bare minimum it was like working with a bunch of wet socks marines cant be wet socks  digging into research by the marine corps and later work done by psychologists and psychiatrists krulak discovered that interior locus of control was a huge predictor of selfmotivation and success locus of control comes in two flavors  • with an interior locus of control you believe that the events in your life are the result of your actions  • with an exterior locus of control you believe that the events in your life are the result of outside forces   what an interior locus of control looks like scott olson  getty studies indicate that an interior locus is associated with being vulnerable to depression doing better in school dealing better with stress finding more active solutions to problems greater satisfaction with work and greater goal orientation but locus of control is not the sort of thing that you can hear a theory about and decide to have it arises when people see the connection between their own efforts and results  after learning this krulak redesigned basic training so it would give recruits a bias toward action  we never tell anyone theyre a naturalborn leader he told duhigg natural born means its outside your control instead we teach them that leadership is learned its the product of effort we push recruits to experience that thrill oftaking control of feeling the rush of being in charge once we get them addicted to that theyre hooked  so now when recruits are thrown into the week boot camp they are faced with situations where they have to make decisions on the fly — whether its how to clean up a dining hall after dinner or how to make it through a brutal hour obstacle course called the crucible its working  duhigg reports that since krulak remade basic training performance scores of new marines and retention rates have both gone up
