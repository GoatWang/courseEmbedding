viruses made of innovative fabric with nanotechnology globally known brand for expertise in maternal and newborn healthestablished cash flowpositive business​as seen in​the world is not safe for womeninsect borne illnesses zika lyme malaria dengue chikungunya etc pose serious health threats for moms and babies they spread quickly across the us and latin america and trigger public health alerts​among significantly affected countries are usa brazil mexico colombia and over  more​ the effects of these viruses can be quite severe for pregnant women and their babies with microcephaly as one consequence of zika current preventive solutions like mosquito repellents have proven to be ineffective research by our partner clinic in el salvador run by americares has documented that women avoid wearing skin based repellents because they smell bad and are expensive our study found that only  of women are not comfortable applying repellent directly to their skin vaccines bed nets community spraying and mosquito traps are not enough women need an inexpensive way to protect themselves from zika as they move about during the day ​this is especially critical for countries without a sophisticated medical system introducing novaveil – a line of protective apparel by maternova incorporating stylish design and nanotechnology​a labor of love between maternova inc and a renowned brazilian designer alessandra gold novaveil is the first line of stylish protective apparel that allows women to feel empowered and confident knowing that they are protecting themselves beautifully​novaveil is using a patented nanotechnologyenhanced textile that repels the mosquitoes that carry viruses this textile allows us to manufacture stylish but affordable garments that women can wear during the day to protect themselves against the zika virus​​novaveil line​​we use the worlds best scientific minds alongside the ideal creative partner to develop original and innovative solutions each detail is crafted specifically for impacted climates and consider the habits of the mosquitoes – they bite in the day and they especially like dark colors – so the designs feature a lighter calming palettematernity dress first ever dress designed to appeal across cultures expand to fit a growing belly and imbued with nanotech repellent thoughtfully constructed for women of all sizes and heightsinterior dress comes with simple cinching ties ruched hem adjusters for full or mid length options cardigan lightweight elongated cardiganincludes a hood to protect the head and hair sleeves that extend over most of the hand for maximum coverage and protection scarf lightweight breathable scarfable to cover the head or the lap can cover an infant bassinet or an infant nursing with mother leggings light colored leggingsprotect the lower half of the body and ankles an area of particular interest to the virus carrying mosquitos​​​​chemicals used by pregnant women must be safe for the mother and for the fetus novaveil is protecting women using a special fabric that does not result in the absorption of repellent chemicals into the skin​ the environmental protection agency reviews clinical and environmental data to ensure consumer protection by using a chemical already approved by the epa we  ensure that it is safe and  save years of approval and testing ​by ensuring a long life for a maternity garment and other pieces we bring down the average cost per day of protection significantly ​ according to studies skinbased repellents are avoided because of odor by providing an odorless solution in the form of apparel we increase the chances that women will use it and be protected​​​ skinbased repellents are a hassle and are quite costly novaveil makes protection from mosquitos effortless – wearing clothing is easier than applying repellent every few hours​ mosquitos in some countries including puerto rico have evolved to be able to resist

institutions and schools for health professionals we work through all avenues to reach the most vulnerable women globally  why is maternova needed why is maternova needed according to the world health organization  women die every day during childbirth with  percent of those deaths taking place in the developing world there are medical tools often times inexpensive ones that make a drastic difference in these outcomeshowever these tools can be difficult to obtain and ship and this is exactly where we have made—and continue to make—inspirational strides what is your impact what is your impact to date we have distributed products in more than  countries and we have helped save the lives of over  women and children  how did maternova start and then evolve how did maternova start and then evolve maternova was originally an educational resource for global public health workers we created our highly acclaimed “innovation index” and began cataloging innovations in various stages of development from all over the world it was our hope and ultimate goal to speed the dissemination of information across all the barriers that exist that initial plan proved wildly successful and inquiries started flooding in from countries all over the world asking how the devices could be obtained   we quickly realized though that simply distributing the products wasn’t enough we had to accomplish two important goals the rigorous field testing of products to ensure they performed as described and met our criteria was essential maternova is extremely lucky to have not only two wonderful boards in place but we also have some fantastic incountry distributors in places like nigeria drc cameroon and many more who are so gracious in their commitment to our mission they test each product we sell at length our testing inoffice of innovations has often provided some hilarious moments of comic relief as well it’s true that some things just never go as planned and we’re ok with that lastly we wanted to develop a more comprehensive suite of products for people it’s not enough to only offer one or two items our customers often order fourplus products with each visit to our marketplace it’s our hope to provide the most effective solutions for the birth experience that don’t always mean just the moment of birth how do you source technologies how do you source technologies we began by researching journals and rd labs  now we are lucky enough that many entrepreneurs and teams come to us to see if we can help commercialize their ideaswe have a screening tool to determine whether technologies are a good fit for our key marketswe start with the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for women and newborns do you have any intellectual property do you have any intellectual property we see a lot of gaps in current solutions  for that reason we do have one provisional patent and we are working on others   what awards or special recognition have you had what

solve what customer problem do you solve the global health marketplace is fragmented and opaque customers those who procure health technologies do not have a trusted source where they can both find out about technologies appropriate to their settings and purchase products with confidence the result is that key channels are simply unaware of the existence of gamechanging technologies andor unable to figure out how to purchase them maternova fills this glaring gap what is your competitive advantage what is your competitive advantage maternova inc has first mover advantage with its first to

providers for a variety of services and we outsource a number of our noncore functions and operations in certain instances we rely on single or limited service providers and outsourcing vendors because the relationship is advantageous due to quality price or lack of alternative sources if production or service was interrupted and we were not able to find alternate thirdparty providers we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages higher freight costs and reengineering costs if outsourcing services are interrupted or not performed or the performance is poor this could impact our ability to process record and report transactions with our customers and other constituents such interruptions in the provision of supplies andor services could result in our inability to meet customer demand damage our reputation and customer relationships and adversely affect our business we depend on third party providers suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services we obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire some of our hardware software and operational support vendors represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights a position of some exclusivity if demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner at our specifications and at reasonable prices our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and have a material negative impact on our operations business financial results and financial condition manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of the products we source or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by governmental authorities and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals similarly negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events an intentional or unintentional disruption failure misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems could severely affect our business such an event might be caused by computer hacking computer viruses worms and other destructive or disruptive software “cyberattacks” and other malicious activity as well as natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks and similar events such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers including degradation of service service disruption excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our plant equipment and data in addition our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential customer data or intellectual property operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities moreover these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions and with us and foreign export control trade embargo and customs laws if we fail to comply with them we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons with whom we contract in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory the company’s success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors its executive officers and key employees in particular the company is dependent on allyson e cote and margaret e wirth cofounders of the company the company has or intends to enter into employment agreements with allyson e cote and margaret e wirth although there can be no assurance that it will do so or that they will continue to be employed by the company for a particular period of time the loss of allyson e cote and margaret e wirth or any member of the board of directors or executive officer could harm the company’s business financial condition cash flow and results of operations although dependent on certain key personnel the company does not have any key man life insurance policies on both key persons the company is dependent on allyson e cote and margaret e wirth in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan however the company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to one of these individuals in the event of their death or disability therefore if allyson e cote die or become disabled the company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person’s absence the loss of such person could negatively affect the company and its operations the development and commercialization of our products are moderately competitive we face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future our competitors include other startup companies worldwide some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in research and development and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize products the company has indicated that it has engaged in certain transactions with related persons in the case of a small loan from ‘friends and family’ at the early stages of the company formation please see the section of this memorandum entitled “transactions with related persons and conflicts of interest” for further details changes in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs these laws include minimum wage requirements overtime pay healthcare reform and the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act unemployment tax rates workers’ compensation rates citizenship requirements union membership and sales taxes a number of factors could adversely affect our operating results including additional governmentimposed increases in minimum wages overtime pay paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits mandated training for employees increased tax reporting and tax payment changing regulations from the national labor relations board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the fair labor standards act the health care reform law the  excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers which began in  may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold for example i where we purchase medical devices from thirdparty manufacturers the manufacturers may increase their prices to cover their payment of the excise tax and our costs to purchase such medical devices may therefore increase and ii where we manufacture medical devices or are the importer of record our cost of goods sold have increased because we are subject to paying the excise tax the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to regulation in the us at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries in addition the us federal and state governments have allocated greater resources to the enforcement of these laws if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we failed to comply our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected a sizable proportion of the products that we manufacture source distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements to lawfully operate our businesses we are required to hold permits licenses and other regulatory approvals from and to comply with operating and security standards of governmental bodies failure to maintain or renew necessary permits licenses or approvals or noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute import or manufacture products product recalls or seizures or criminal and civil sanctions and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the manufacture distribution marketing and use of the products we source are subject to extensive regulation and increased scrutiny by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory bodies in brazil colombia mexico nigeria and south any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by fda and foreign regulatory authorities changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter failure to comply with the requirements of fda or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations the sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies compliance with the antikickback statute false claims act food drug and cosmetic act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including fda office of inspector general oig department of justice doj and the federal trade commission part of our business model does rely on thirdparty distributors to effectively distribute our products outside the united states we depend in part on medical device distributors for the marketing and selling of our products in foreign countries we depend on these distributors’ efforts to market our products yet we are unable to control their efforts completely these distributors typically sell a variety of other noncompeting products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling our products in addition we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products if our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products in full compliance with applicable laws our operating results and business may suffer recruiting and retaining qualified thirdparty distributors and training them in our technology and product offerings require significant time and resources to develop and expand our distribution we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors further if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates we may be unable to replace that distributor without disruption to our business if we fail to maintain relationships with our distributors fail to develop new relationships with other distributors including in new markets fail to manage train or incentivize existing distributors effectively or fail to provide distributors with competitive products on attractive terms or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts our revenue may decrease and our operating results reputation and business may be harmed the design manufacture and marketing of the medical devices we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims manufacturing and marketing of the commercial products we source and clinical testing of our products under development may expose us to product liability and other tort claims although we have and intend to maintain liability insurance the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations there are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products which we manufacture or sell including component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time any costs the material components of which are settlements judgments legal fees and other related defense costs not covered under our previously issued product liability insurance policies and existing reserves could have a material adverse effect on our revenues financial position and cash flows additionally product liability claims could negatively affect our reputation continued product sales and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products if thirdparty payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of our products our revenues will be negatively impacted our success in marketing our products depends in large part on whether us and international government health administrative authorities private health insurers and other organizations will adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of our products in the united states a thirdparty payor’s decision to provide coverage for our products does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be obtained further one thirdparty payor’s decision to cover our products does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the products or provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a countrybycountry basis in many international markets a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country further many international markets have governmentmanaged healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as governmentmanaged systems if sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for our current or future products in either the united states or internationally the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected show all risks discussion   loading maternova follow   funded maternova successfully raised
