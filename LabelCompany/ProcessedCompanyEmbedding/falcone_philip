continue reading the main story photo philip a falcone barred from the securities business until  now oversees hc holdings a publicly traded company credit chang w leethe new york times philip a falcone the brash hedge fund titan who once managed  billion before stumbling and running afoul of regulators is pressing ahead on a new comeback effort his secondhis latest investment platform is a publicly traded company with  million in assets called hc holdings it has bought a couple of midsize businesses — an undersea cable installer and a steel fabricator — that are intended to generate cash to help support several smaller growth prospects that include operations in wireless services naturalgas truckfueling stations life sciences insurance and sportsfor mr falcone the goal is to make smart acquisitions and hit home runs with some of the smaller earlierstage ventures much as he once did by buying bonds of companies in financial distressthe new venture also allows him to stay active during a regulatory ban that bars him from the securities and investment advisory businesses until  regulators have allowed him to run a public company that buys whole businesses instead of managing a fund trading stocks and bonds advertisement continue reading the main story in an interview mr falcone said he was aiming to “go out and acquire companies and build on that” creating value through growth in diverse industries continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “i feel like not that i have a lot to prove but i look at this vehicle as ‘success is the best revenge’ ” he addedcharles frischer a private investor in seattle whose family owns  million shares or  percent of hc said mr falcone would be “completely redeemed” if he could build hc’s assets to  billion or  billionbut mr falcone faces hurdles at hc which has been hampered by his history and has already encountered a few setbacks after quadrupling in price based on its debtfinanced acquisitions its stock has fallen by  percent this summer amid sales by a large investor and a  million takeover bid that could have doubled hc’s size was rejected recentlyand the results at his first comeback a larger publiccompany vehicle he started six years ago were underwhelmingstill mr falcone is undeterred“people kind of look at me as i am unbelievably aggressive and i probably do make some people nervous” mr falcone a former harvard hockey center said in a large conference room in his park avenue office for which he pays part of the rent because hc alone is not big enough to afford itexplaining his motivation he said “i’m a competitor i think i’m an unbelievable competitor” he added “as the youngest of nine kids in a threebedroom house i learned how not to give up”mr falcone  has already known triumph and adversity on a large scaleafter a decade as a highyield bond trader on wall street he began the harbinger capital hedge fund in  initially focusing on distressed debt in  he personally earned  billion and doubled his investors’ money on a winning bet against subprime mortgages advertisement continue reading the main story he also indulged in a real estate spending spree paying  million for a room manhattan townhouse once owned by the penthouse publisher bob guccione and  million for a mountainside caribbean villa in st bartsbut in  he got caught in the market downdraft with too many illiquid positions just as he faced  billion in redemption demands from his investors those demands forced him to block investor exits even as he took a  million loan in  to pay his own taxes while he was also buying out a cofounding partner for about  millionwhile harbinger documents gave him the right to obtain the loan the securities and exchange commission said in  that he did not form a required fairness committee did not pay the same rate as harbinger was paying to borrow and did not disclose the loan to investors for five monthsthe cloud of the sec inquiry which began in  coupled with losses in  and  eventually doomed the hedge fund still twofifths owned by mr falcone it retains a few illiquid holdings chiefly a  percent stake in lightsquared a wireless spectrum owner potentially worth billions and a hotelcasinogolf resort in vietnammr falcone’s first comeback attempt was a public company shell he bought through his hedge fund in  and renamed harbinger group now known as hrg groupwith mr falcone as chief executive hrg grew to a market value of  billion with debt of  billion partly by issuing new shares in exchange for assets from the hedge fund for example it acquired a majority stake in spectrum brands which sells black  decker appliances and george foreman grills newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre

preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime but the sec charges and harbinger’s losses put a cloud over hrg stock an article in barron’s noted that the shares traded at a discount to its net asset value “partly reflecting investor uneasiness with falcone”with the hedge fund selling hrg stock to meet redemptions two outside investors leucadia national and fortress investment group built positions totaling  percent by mid gaining three board seats and that paved the way for mr falcone’s departurein early  hrg invested about  million for a  percent stake in hc as a new but smaller falcone acquisition platform with a broader mandate that gave him more autonomy mr falcone said hrg directors “had lived through the issues with the sec and i think it created a little bit of tension and uneasiness with the board” in order to expand hrg in the wider way he envisions for hc “i really would have had to push and battle” advertisement continue reading the main story so mr falcone turned his focus to hc last november he stepped down as hrg’s chief executive reaping a  million exit payout during his tenure hrg stock’s price gain of  percent trailed broader market averages the standard  poor’s stock index for example gained  percent over the same periodhc is now the stage for falcone comeback no last year the company paid  million for global marine systems an undersea cable installer and  million for the schuff international steel fabrication businessthose companies are meant to generate cash to help fund the venturestage growth bets one such bet is american natural gas a small chain of  truck fueling stations that sell compressed natural gas instead of diesel fuel“we probably started off a little bit slow” mr falcone told investors in august referring to american natural gas “we’re going to make a big push in that area over the next six to  months”but the risks can be seen in the steep  percent interest rate that hc is paying on its  million in junkbond debt and in its roller coaster stock actionearlier this year with hc stock still rising mr falcone sought to buy mcg capital — a middlemarket commercial finance company whose cash assets could have doubled hc’s size — in a bid of mostly stock mcg however spurned mr falcone choosing another suitor and raising the prospect of potential regulatory hurdles because of the sec case against himjust then with the takeover battle in full swing hrg signaled that it had begun selling hc shares sending the stock price sharply lower and cutting the value of the bid for mcg as the stock fell mr falcone said the question arose why he wasn’t buying on aug  mcg holders decisively rejected the falcone bidalthough mr falcone had been blocked from buying hc shares just then by a preearnings trading blackout the issue of his hc stock ownership remains valid most of his holdings are in options which he can earn under a performance formula tied to bolstering the company’s netasset value advertisement continue reading the main story while the latest hc proxy lists him as owning  million shares for an  percent stake most of that count represents options he has not exercised as of april  he owned only  shares outright currently worth just  millionthat means mr falcone gains more if the stock rises than he loses if it drops trying to build hc quickly to reap such rewards could heighten the risk for other investors but mr frischer the seattle investor said the upside from hc’s speculative holdings “could be very high”explaining his small stake in hc mr falcone said his money “is tied up” with about onethird in his personal real estate holdings — estimated to be worth a few hundred million dollars — and much of the rest in his remaining stakes in the hedge fund and hrg as a concession to his shrunken empire this year he sold his minority stake in the minnesota wild professional hockey teammr falcone insists he is not going to rush things at hc calling the recent stockprice decline “a blip”“from a logic perspective i have to take my time i can’t be flippant” he said “i’m looking to build value between now and  years from now it doesn’t happen overnight” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage dealbook philip falcone hedge fund chief in exile is stepping down nov
