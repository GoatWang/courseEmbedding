and issues open letter to shareholders highlights governance concerns and share price underperformance at sirintends to seek the election of its highly qualified nominee to sirs board of trustees at  annual meeting of shareholdersexpresses concerns that sir is seeking to accelerate record date for  annual meeting jan    et from lakewood capital management lp new york jan   prnewswire  lakewood capital management lp together with its affiliates lakewood the second largest unaffiliated shareholder of select income reit sir or the company nyse sir with current ownership of approximately  of the outstanding shares of sir today announced that it has filed a detailed presentation with the securities and exchange commission sec  in the presentation lakewood outlines its concerns with sirs governance and the misalignment of incentives between the company and its manager reit management  research llc rmr  the presentation also includes detailed information regarding the vast qualifications of lakewoods nominee for election to sirs board of trustees william h lenehan  on december   lakewood nominated mr lenehan a real estate executive with significant public company experience for election to the board of trustees at sirs  annual meeting of shareholders  lakewood firmly believes that mr lenehans election as a trustee would give shareholders a voice towards improving the companys corporate governance and share price performance  as set forth in more detail in the presentation lakewood believes that with proper governance improvements sir shares could be worth  per share or more representing an increase of over  above recent trading levels lakewoods detailed presentation is available at the secs website and can be viewed by clicking the following link httptinyurlcomlakewoodpresentationjan additionally lakewood announced today it has delivered an open letter to sir shareholders the full text of which follows january   dear fellow shareholders funds managed by lakewood capital management lp lakewood currently own in the aggregate approximately  of the outstanding shares of select income reit sir or the company  we are longterm sir shareholders having owned shares since the days immediately following the companys initial public offering in march   like many of you we have grown frustrated with the poor governance at sir that we believe has led to the stocks significant discount to net asset value and dramatic underperformance over the past year  we believe this remarkably low stock valuation and significant share price underperformance is a direct result of governance concerns resulting from the misalignment of incentives between the company and its manager reit management  research llc rmr and a board of trustees that has not duly protected the interests of shareholders  on december   lakewood nominated william h lenehan a highly qualified real estate executive with significant public company experience to the board of trustees to give shareholders a voice and improve the companys governance    earlier today we filed a detailed presentation with the sec that is available on the secs website at the following link httptinyurlcomlakewoodpresentationjan specifically our presentation outlines the following our belief that sir shares could be worth  per share or more representing an increase of  above recent trading levels how sirs stock trades at a deep discount to its net asset value and has dramatically underperformed its peers due we believe to widelyheld concerns around corporate governance the misalignment of interests due to sirs external management structure in which rmr receives fees almost entirely based off of the size of the assets of the company as opposed to sirs share price performance several recent actions taken by the board of trustees that have only served to deepen investor mistrust our belief that shareholders will benefit meaningfully from enhanced governance and greater accountability the vast qualifications of william h lenehan our nominee to the board of trustees and an accomplished real estate executive who can help improve governance at sir record date please note that we have been advised that sir has notified broadridge financial solutions of a wednesday january   record date for the sir  annual meeting of shareholders the annual meeting  for comparison this date is  days earlier in the year than expected based on last years record date of march   for the  annual meeting  we have serious concerns that the acceleration of the record date will disenfranchise certain shareholders with respect to the election of trustees at the  annual meeting  importantly if sir sets january   as the record date for the  annual meeting any shares must be purchased for all practical purposes by the end of trading on thursday january   allowing for a three day settlement period to be entitled to be voted at the  annual meeting  furthermore sir shareholders should call their broker to ensure that their shares are not currently being lent out in order to make sure that those shares are in their brokers possession and can be voted at the sir  annual meeting we look forward to communicating with you in more detail in the weeks to come regarding our serious concerns at sir and the election of our highly qualified nominee to sirs board of trustees at the  annual meeting  sincerely anthony t bozza managing partner lakewood capital management lp   about lakewood capital management lp lakewood capital management lp is an secregistered
