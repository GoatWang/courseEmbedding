find highquality managers who invest in various asset classes selects or structures suitable investment vehicles that optimise riskadjusted returns for tetragon’s capital and seeks for tetragon to own a share of the asset management company through tfg asset management tetragon aims to not only produce assetlevel returns but also aims to enhance these returns with profits from owning asset management businesses that derive income from external investors thus tetragon seeks to use its balance sheet to facilitate the growth of tfg asset management to help create value for itself and for its shareholders some of the growth of tfg asset management has been organic – through active capital raising into existing businesses leveraging off the tfg asset management platform and launching new businesses such as hawke’s point the investment manager has also sought to accelerate growth through joint ventures and partnerships with existing businesses and via acquisitions as was the case with equitix certain considerations when evaluating the viability of a potential asset manager typically include performance track records reputation regulatory requirements infrastructure needs and asset gathering capacity potential profitability and scalability of the business are also important considerations additionally the core capabilities investment focus and strategy of any new business should offer a complementary operating income stream to tfg asset management’s existing businesses the investment manager looks to mitigate potential correlated risks across tfg asset management’s investment managers by diversifying its exposure across asset classes investment vehicles durations and investor types among other factors tetragons asset management businesses can operate autonomously or on the tfg asset management platform in either case the objective is for them to benefit from an established infrastructure which can assist in critical business management functions such as risk management investor relations financial control technology and compliancelegal matters while maintaining entrepreneurial independence tetragons permanent capital base should increase the likelihood of success for this strategy of investing in alternative asset managers and the assets they manage as its capital is available both for supporting operations of the management businesses and for coinvesting seeding or anchoring new investment funds of the managers the investment manager believes that considerable value has been built within tfg asset management given the significantly increased scale of tfg asset management in light of its organic growth and in particular following the february  acquisition of equitix the investment manager has determined to continue to grow tfg
