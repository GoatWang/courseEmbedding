operations financial position and cash flows in the future business overview atlas resources public  b lp we us or the partnership is a delaware limited partnership and formed on april   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or the mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resources partners lp arp arp  on october   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy atls  and its midstream subsidiary atlas pipeline partners lp apl entered into definitive agreements to be acquired by targa resources corp and targa resources partners lp respectively immediately prior to the acquisition atlas energy distributed to its unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner which changed its name to atlas energy group llc new atlas and became a separate publicly traded company as a result of the distribution following the distribution new atlas continues to hold the partnerships business as well as arps general partner interest and incentive distribution rights and now holds the nonmidstream assets and arp limited partner units previously held by atlas energy we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and indiana we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy after february   new atlas for administrative services we intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which primarily produce natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as  well tending routine maintenance and adjustment  reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and  preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of december   our mgp withheld  of net production revenue for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry natural gas the mgp markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to thirdparty plant operators who process and market the gas the sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index the production area and pricing indices for the appalachian basin are dominion south point tennessee gas pipeline and transco leidy line we do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes as is customary in certain of our other operating areas we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement crude oil crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company the crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region less appropriate trucking charges we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements natural gas liquids ngls are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining dry gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline the resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our ngls are generally priced using the mont belvieu tx or conway ks regional processing indices the cost to process and fractionate the ngls from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of ngls in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements for the year ended december   chevron natural gas accounted for approximately  of our total natural gas oil and ngl production revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than  of revenues for this period general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of  and early  particularly in december  and january  the causes of these declines are based on a number of factors including but not limited to a significant increase in natural gas oil and ngl production while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the longterm in the areas in which we operate fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas oil and ngl reserves our future gas and oil reserves production cash flow our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently we face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas oil and ngl prices as initial reservoir pressures are depleted natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases results of operations gas and oil production the following table sets forth information related to our production revenues volumes sales prices production costs and depletion during

previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period previously recognized derivative gains were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively natural gas revenues our natural gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year period was attributable to  decrease in production volumes and a  decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions our production volumes decreased to  mcf per day for the year ended december   from  mcf per day for the year ended december   a decrease of   mcf per day the price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements see item  oil revenues we drill wells primarily to produce natural gas rather than oil but some wells have limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in oil revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in production volumes partially offset by a  increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges our production volumes decreased to  bbl per day for the year ended december   from  bbls per day for the year ended december   a decrease of  bbl per day  natural gas liquids revenue the majority of our wells produce dry gas which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser some wells however produce wet gas which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons ie natural gas liquids that must be removed prior to transporting the gas once removed these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers our natural gas liquids revenues were  for the year ended december   there were no natural gas liquid revenues for the year ended december   costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   this decrease was mostly due to a decrease in transportation fees which was partially offset by an increase in water hauling and disposal fees depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively this change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us impairments of gas and oil properties for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively annually we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value to the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value an impairment charge is recognized as a result of this assessment an impairment charge was recognized for the years ended december   and  this charge is based on reserve quantities future market prices and our carrying value we cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods sale of gas and oil properties on december   the partnership sold its gas and oil properties in the antrim shale geological formation mostly located in michigan with a net book value of  for  cash proceeds from the sale will be distributed to the partnership unit holders in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement as a result of the sale  of gas and oil properties  of accumulated depletion and impairment and  of asset retirement obligations were removed from the partnership accounts resulting in a net gain of  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased  for the year ended december   to  as compared to  for the year ended december   this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before depletion impairment accretion and a decrease in the noncash loss on derivative value of  in addition the change in accounts payable tradeaffiliate of  and the change in asset retirement receivableaffiliate decreased  the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts receivable tradeaffiliate of  the change in accrued liabilities of  and the change in gain on sale of oil and gas

investing activities was  for the year ended december   resulting from the net of  in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and  for the purchase of tangible equipment cash used in financing activities decreased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   this decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs through december   our mgp withheld  of funds for this purpose any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties we are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners historically there has been no need to borrow funds from our mgp to fund operations impairment during the years ended december   and  we recognized  and  respectively of impairments related to gas and oil properties these impairments related to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   and  the estimates of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety see item  environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last  years and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants generation and disposal of wastes including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity and use storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health the environment andor endangered species other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change or that our efforts will prevent material costs if any from rising changes in prices and inflation our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects secured hedge facility the mgp has a secured hedge facility agreement with a syndicate of banks under which the partnership has the ability to enter into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price movements under the mgps revolving credit facility the partnership is required to utilize this secured hedge facility for future commodity risk management activity the partnerships obligations under the facility are secured by mortgages on its gas and oil properties and first priority security interests in substantially all of its assets and by a guarantee of the mgp the mgp administers the commodity price risk management activity for the partnership under the secured hedge facility the secured hedge facility agreement

of such breach is to cause amounts owing under swap agreements governed by the secured hedge facility to become immediately due and payable critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals depletion and amortization impairment fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions we summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements see item financial statements included in this report the critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below depletion and impairment of longlived assets longlived assets the cost of natural gas and oil properties less estimated salvage value is generally depleted on the unitsofproduction method natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable a longlived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions including natural gas and oil prices production and operating expenses any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset as discussed in general trends and outlook within this section recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods during the years ended december   and  we recognized  and  of impairments within natural gas and oil properties these impairments related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   and  the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices at the date of measurement events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include among other factors operating losses unused capacity market value declines technological developments resulting in obsolescence changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products changes in competition and competitive practices uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies changes in the expected level of environmental capital operating or remediation expenditures and changes in governmental regulations or actions fair value of financial instruments we have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources whereas unobservable inputs reflect the partnerships own market assumptions which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort the hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved

investing in atlas resources public  b lp if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses according to their website atlas resources partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors  the company often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for atlas resources public  b lp these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from  atlas resources partners lp filed for bankruptcy protection on july  and joins dozens of struggling oil and gas producers that were pushed into chapter  after energy prices began dropping in  since the beginning of  at least  north american oil and gas producers have defaulted according to haynes  boone llp those cases involve about  billion in cumulative debt the law firm said in a june  report the trouble with alternative investment products like atlas resources public  b lp is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds  an additional risk inherent to atlas resource partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities the white law group continues to investigate the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like atlas resources public  b lp broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commission and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresentation the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim to determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of atlas resources public  b lp or

for which there are identifiable cash flows the review of the partnership’s oil and gas properties is done on a fieldbyfield basis by determining if the historical cost of proved properties less the applicable accumulated depletion and abandonment is less than the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows the expected future cash flows are estimated based on the partnership’s plans to continue to produce and develop proved reserves expected future cash flow from the sale of production of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices the partnership estimates prices based upon current contracts in place adjusted for basis differentials and market related information including published futures prices the estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future levels of prices and costs field decline rates market demand and supply and the economic and regulatory climates if the carrying value exceeds such cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value as determined by discounted future cash flows and the carrying value of the assets the determination of oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a subjective process and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary considerably from actual results  in addition reserve estimates for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable than those based on actual production  estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions which could be substantial based on the availability of additional information which could cause the assumptions to be modified  the partnership cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods there were no impairments of oil and gas properties recorded by the partnership for the three months and period ended september   working interest the partnership agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to the mgp and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions “the working interest” the mgp is also provided an additional working interest of  as provided in the partnership agreement due to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all drilling costs estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are utilized to allocate revenues and expenses until the wells are completely drilled and turned online into production once the wells are completed the final working interest ownership of the partners is determined and any previously allocated revenues and expenses based on the estimated working interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the

value of financial instruments the partnership has established a hierarchy to measure its financial instruments at fair value which requires it to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize

assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level – inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability level – unobservable inputs that reflect the entities own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the partnership has certain assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in its balance
