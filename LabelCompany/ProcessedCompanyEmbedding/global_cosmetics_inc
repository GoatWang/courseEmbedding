world check the tag youll see st peters missouri on it coolkmov video manage your sales reps better bloomberg businessweek  amy barrettjune  rebecca herwick is tough enough to look at home on her harley but even she was thrown when seven of her nine sales reps walked out on aug   in the midst of a sales reorganization i knew it was coming but the day it came i felt suckerpunched says herwick if i was a girl i would have criedherwick the owner and ceo of global products a harley davidson licensee that makes everything from bandanas to coffee mugs knew her sales strategy wasnt working herwick had been using independent sales reps rather than an inhouse sales force to sell her wares to odd harley dealers nationwide that kept fixed costs low—independent reps are paid commissiononly—but it also meant herwicks reps all sold products from other companies as well while those products didnt compete directly with her  million employee company herwick didnt think global was getting the attention it deserved there were other headaches not all the reps entered orders directly into globals computer system creating more work for the companys customer service team and some reps didnt do a good job explaining custom orders so when those jobs couldnt be turned around fast enough customers got frustrated and herwick looked like the bad guyground rulesherwick thought she might do better with an internal sales force i wanted my power back she says but the independent reps helped keep payroll costs down in the end herwick found it was costprohibitive to move sales inhouse daniel mcquiston director of education for the nonprofit manufacturers representatives educational research foundation estimates that a person sales force for a  million company could cost  million annually in training salaries and bonus compared with less than half that for reps earning  the reps also gave global broad geographic reach and they covered their own travel expenses but managing a contract sales force requires clear expectations effective systems for tracking performance and penalties for those who dont play by the rulesthat meant herwick needed more out of her reps in november  she laid down some new ground rules reps would only get commissions on orders they put into globals computer system instead of the  commission they had been receiving reps would start earning  to get back to  theyd have to get calendars of special events and promotions from each customer visit dealers and take photos of globals products and deliver feedback surveys from each dealer four times a year thats when the reps rebelled with seven of the nine walking the others quit within a yearin hiring a new team herwick insisted on a passion for motorcycles and a comfort level with her technology she only considered reps who had three or fewer other lines that they would be selling to her clients by january  herwick had a new group in placecertainly there were some bumps in the road two of the new hires left after herwick found they were selling competing products herwick decided she needed to cut down on paperwork so reps now send in customer calendars and showroom photos just twice a year global has a more formal structure than many other companies says bill scharr a rep who signed on in november  you either bought into the program or you didntthe experience was nervewracking but herwick would do it over again i will not let history repeat itself where someone is controlling me she saysthe disruption and the changes have been worthwhile sales are only growing at about  a year compared with  in  but herwick says that  was unsustainable especially since the growth in motorcycle sales had already started to slow that year given the overall state of the economy she thinks shes doing wellmore important customers notice a difference brandi hamel motorclothes manager for bruce rossmeyers boston harleydavidson in everett mass says that before the overhaul she didnt know the name of her global products rep but the new rep scharr helps out at some of our events consistently updates us on where our orders are and is in touch with me at least biweekly says hamel we now have a personal connection to the company and everything is so much easier for herwick too power lunch with susan solovic show  part  building your million dollar business
