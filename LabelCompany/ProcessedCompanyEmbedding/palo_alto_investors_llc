end pai offers several healthcare sector funds the cornerstone of each funds’ investment philosophy is our belief that intensive original research is required to discover and evaluate inefficiently

overlooked by wall street wall street coverage is positively correlated to a companys market capitalization leaving smallercap stocks with less coverage and greater opportunity for mispricing closet indexing by institutional investors increases the focus on the large cap stocks that make up substantial portions of popular benchmarks institutional investors often spend little effort researching microcap and smallcap opportunities because of their limited impact on major indices this lack of coverage allows disciplined investors with inhouse research capabilities such as palo alto investors to buy stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic value at pai we apply our expertise original insight independent thinking and exhaustive research process to identify companies that we believe are best positioned to achieve superior longterm performance we intentionally avoid emerging growth stocks and instead seek to invest in fundamentally sound and capablyled businesses that are
