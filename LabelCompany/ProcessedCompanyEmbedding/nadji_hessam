hessam hessam nadji thank you evelyn on behalf of the entire marcus  millichap team good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our  yearend earnings call  was characterized by slowing sales and heightened uncertainty in the marketplace which challenged mmi financial performance particularly in the final quarter by laser focused on helping our clients through achieving environment we once again increased market share and strength of the companys longterm growth prospects through key platform investments and by expanding our sales force after a robust fixed year recovery investments sales in the market were flat to moderately lower throughout most of the year but this transition was exacerbated into a sharp decline in the fourth quarter the unexpected jump in interest rate following the presidential election was the primary cause in addition a wait and see stand among many investors also emerged in anticipation of tax reform regulatory easing and economic proposal by the new administration these plans to boost growth should eventually help prolonged economic expansion and generate more demand for real estates however uncertainty around these measures along with a widened bidask spread or added headwind that continue to persist into  clarity on the proposed government policy and a recalibration on buyer seller price expectation should bring investors off the sideline and spur more sales activity beyond these current headwinds the latest data still point to a healthy property fundamental and lack of leveraging in this cycle as key drivers or still active albeit slower real estate investment sales market with this backdrop mmi grew revenues by  increased sales volume by  to a record  billion and grew transactions by approximately  to nearly  we achieved net income of  million compared to  million in  or a decline of  primarily due to investments in our infrastructure proprietary technology as well as expanded business development initiatives for our brokers we believe strongly that these investments which we outlined going into  and echoed throughout the year will support longterm growth and competitive advantages our earnings were all impacted by our higher commission payout as our senior brokers accounted for a higher proportion of revenue in a more challenging market for the year mmi added  to its sales force which now stands a record and positions us for further market share growth in addressing our fourth quarter results let me first review a few critical data points while the market was expecting a gradual increase in interest rate in the second half of  between november  and december  the tenyear treasury yields jumped by as much as  basis point as a result you saw bidask spreads lender tightening and extended transaction timelines throughout the first five months of year become much more pronounced causing the repricing and reunderwriting of many pending transactions and active listings as a result we experienced an increase in deal cancellations and longer closing delays preliminary industry estimates point to a  drop in market transactions and sales volumes during the final quarter of  in contrast market sales in the fourth quarter of  registered yearoveryear growth of  and volume grew  over the fourth quarter of  the postelection jump in interest rates was especially hard on smaller private client transactions which typically use higher leverage as we stated many times in the past over the long run sales in the  million to  million private client market segments are less volatile than higher priced assets thanks to indiscernible partnership changes and other personal circumstances however in any given period particularly with an unexpected and sizeable jump in interest rates and market uncertainties private investor sentiment price and risk tolerance can be affected as we observed in the fourth quarter of  last but not least we pointed out on our thirdquarter  earnings call for mmi the fourth quarter of  had outside growth of nearly  of revenue and  growth in transaction making comparisons particularly challenging fourth quarter revenue was down  from the fourth quarter of  and the quarter ended with sales volume of nearly  billion on over  transactions sales volume and transactional counts were down during the quarter by  basis points and  respectively indicating meaningful market share gains in contrast to the estimated  decline in market sales i mentioned earlier let me just take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and expertise required of our team to close over  transactions on behalf of our clients during the quarter given the rapid change in interest rates and in many cases renegotiating among the parties and having to requalify transactions for financing while the extra work needed to close transactions in the fourth quarter reduced productivity towards new business development we were able to successfully meet the vast majority of our client’s transactional need our private client market segment which are transactions between  to  million once again delivered nearly  of our brokerage commissions and continues to be the foundation of our business revenue for this segment grew  in the year but declined  for the quarter due to the factor i shared earlier again this was against a very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of  which posted private client revenue growth of nearly  brokerage revenues on the sale of properties valued at  million and above increased  to  million with the fourth quarter increasing  on a yearoveryear basis this was a testament for our senior agents and ipa divisions ability to effectively service our private and institutional clients in a changing market environment it is also reflective of the growing number of private clients who are consolidating their portfolios into larger assets and institutional clients utilizing our platform to access private capital our specialty brokerage division also continued to gain ground last year with an overall transaction increase of  and a volume gain of  we saw particular strength in senior housing selfstorage single tenanted lease and hospitality our financing division mmcc saw loan volume growth of  for the year to just over  billion and transaction increase of  to  transactions these results were hampered by the drop in activity during the fourth quarter especially among affordable and tax multifamily financings the jump in interest rates and expectation of tax reform had particularly adverse effect on these transactions expansion of mmcc remains one of our key growth opportunities to this end we have been working on expanding our network of capital sources over the past year and announced a correspondent relationship with readycap in the third quarter of last year readycap is a gse lender specializing in small balanced multifamily loans and although still in its early stages our relationship has been well received and starting to generate transactions i’m also happy to announce another proprietary preferred correspondent relationship with pgim real estate finance a commercial mortgage business of prudential financial this program is specifically designed to increase our access to lending options in the middle market and larger balanced multifamily transaction pgim offers one of the most comprehensive set of real estate finance products including gse debt for market rate and affordable housing fha conduit and indiscernible general count a formal announcement will be made shortly these correspondent relationships are designed to provide more options to our clients and added deal controls for all loan originators both of these relationships also provide dedicated resources that are highly responsive with competitive pricing for marcus  millichap clients let me now address the four pillars that impact our business which include the economy real estate supply and demand capital markets and investment sales the economy is creating jobs that are modest to consistent pace which we believe is sustainable it’s not likely to accelerate to some degree assuming infrastructure spending and tax performance come to fruition on the supply demand front the overall balance in the market appears sustainable with positive rent growth construction is clear to increasing across various property sites however with the exception of highend apartments in the top  most active metros overbuilding is not likely in the foreseeable future we are seeing softness in luxury apartments in select metros but the sector as a whole is still performing well the older workforce housing stock that comprise the majority of the market and our sales in particular is seeing high occupancies and strong rent growth capital markets in particularly have maintained ample liquidity levels for both debt and equity but caution is the order lenders are active in the marketplace and competitive but have a more conservative stance on underwriting and buyer qualification the fed is signaling a more aggressive position on raising rates as inflation gathers momentum as weve shared before we believe an orderly rise in interest rate indiscernible strong job growth should not be disruptive to the market in fact rising interest rates coupled with the eventual policy clarity i mentioned earlier could provide further motivation for many investors to come indiscernible finally the slowing trend in investment sales will likely remain exaggerated for the first half of  due to the headwinds i outlined earlier but again eventual clarity on various policies should be a catalyst for increased activity despite the overall trend toward a more tempered market environment after record years it is critical that we keep a perspective of the size of the market especially as related to mmis longterm growth prospect in  there were an estimated  trades with  in the  million to  million private client segment even in a slowing market the size and fragmentation of the marketplace provides ample room for additional share gains for our company as with other market transitions throughout our year history our priority is to increase our client outreach and help them formulate and execute the best strategy we are also focused on expansion and strategic metros additional hiring and advancing our training programs and updating our sales force deployment for better market coverage we continue to invest in the right platform improvement while effectively managing other costs we are confident that mmis platform and brand will continue to gain market share in an evolving commercial real estate transaction environment and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout  i will now turn the call over to marty to discuss our results in more detail marty martin louie thanks hessam i will be discussing our fourth quarter  and yearend results in greater detail total revenues in the fourth quarter were  million compared to  million in the prior year as hessam mentioned earlier this was against an outside fourth quarter of  comparison where we saw revenues increase  the decrease during this quarter was due to a decline in all of a market segments on a yearoveryear with the exception of our larger transaction real estate brokerage business which saw  growth total revenues for  improved  to  million primarily driven by increases in our real estate brokerage commission which comprised  of our revenues or  million for the year driving our revenue growth was the increase in average transaction size average commissions for transactions and the number of executed deals our agents executed nearly  brokerage transactions for the year compared to just over  during  for an increase of approximately  we ended the year with a total of  professionals for a net addition of  overall we executed  transactions for the fourth quarter of  down  from the prior year total transactions for the year increased  for  despite an overall decline in transaction market this improvement came on top of s strong growth in transaction of nearly  which we have indiscernible as a tough comparison sales volume for the full year increased by  to  billion revenue from financing fees generated by mmcc grew by  to  million for the quarter and by  to  million for the year and accounting for approximately  of total revenue mmcc revenues during the fourth quarter was particularly challenged by the drop in affordable and tax credit multifamily transactions other revenues which is comprised primarily of consulting and advisory fees along with referral fees from other real estate brokers was down both during the quarter and for the full year by approximately  note that this revenue stream only contributes  towards the companys total revenue total operating expenses were  million for the quarter compared to  million for  for a reduction of  the lower cost in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a  decline in cost of services as a result of lower revenues on a yearoveryear basis as a reminder cost of services is primarily variable commissions paid to the companys investment sales professional and compensation related to financing activity cost of services during the fourth quarter as a percent of total revenues rose by  basis points to  compared to last year the increase was primarily due to the proportion of market transactions closed by our more senior agents who are typically compensated at higher commission rate sga for the quarter decreased to  million compared to  million for the same period last year the decrease was primarily due to lower management performancebased compensation offset by increased investments towards improving our infrastructure platform and our agent business development to expand on this a large portion of our investments went towards improving and expanding our offices in key strategic markets which we have identified as having opportunities for growth rather than opening new offices we believe the most effective way to increase shares to strategically deploy additional agents into these key markets that have existing mmi offices as such leases in these locations such as manhattan palo alto san diego newport beach atlanta denver just to name a few are renewed with expanded footprints these larger offices which were designed to promote collaboration communication and workplace productivity have often well received by our sales professionals clients and employees in addition to strategic office expansions we also focused our investments towards replacement of proprietary information systems with webbased mobile technology with new and improved institutional quality output for our clients while improving the efficiencies for our agents marcus  millichap research products and services were also enhanced to keep us as the leading source of market intelligence for our clients while these investments are pressuring our margins these initiatives support our longterm growth and have been very well received internally and by our clients on a fullyear basis total operating expenses which included cost of services sga and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization increased  ending the year at  million compared to  million in  this increase is consistent with what we have messaged throughout the year for the quarter net income was  million compared to  million in  and for the year net income decreased by approximately  to  million adjusted ebitda was  million during the quarter compared to  million in  for the year adjusted ebitda decreased by  to  million our adjusted ebitda margin of  for the year reflects both topline as well as expense pressures and overall slowing transaction market throughout the year based on current market conditions our margins will continue to be pressured during  however we believe expense leveraging will take place starting in late   from a balance sheet perspective marcus  millichap continues to be well positioned to grow its business organically and to pursue selective acquisitions our r liquidity levels are very healthy ending the year with cash and cash equivalents and core cash investments of approximately  million the senior management team continues to explore avenues for external growth as well as return of capital alternatives given our liquidity levels and our continued strong cash flow generation however as we have said in the past our strong balance sheet affords us tremendous flexibility and advantage as we look forward for strategic opportunities to increase shareholder value before closing id like to point out a number of key items and highlights which may have an impact on our  results first the first quarter of  will face another challenging comparison given brokerage revenue growth of nearly  in the first quarter of  in addition expenses for the first quarter are typically higher due to our agent awards and recognition programs based on their prioryear performance second the strategic initiatives that we outlined in  will continue in  given their importance to our longterm growth third in recent quarters we have made significant inroads in penetrating the largest transaction market which tend to have high variability from quarter to quarter and lastly in comparison to the first few months of  we are facing a more challenging market environment with growing ph sales i like to now open up to the call for qa operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from brad burke of goldman sachs please go ahead brad burke good afternoon guys so i wanted to ask about the pressure that you saw in the fourth quarter do you have a sense of how much of that was related to the spike we saw on interest rates versus policy uncertainty because its unlikely were going to see interest rates spike every single quarter my guess is that well see policy uncertainty remain for some time hessam nadji brad good afternoon i agree with your assessment the interest rate spikes really did have an effect on transactions that were underway but at the same time the added headwinds of the uncertainty relating to policy and so on is pretty serious i mean as we are hearing from our clients theyre really waiting to hear more direction and more clarity on what all of those things could mean to the economy and to real estate so for the fourth quarter i agree with your assessments but on an ongoing basis were still feeling quite a bit of a headwind from that uncertainty brad burke is there a reason that the private client segment is more dramatically impacted i saw in the press release that higher debt ratios are a factor but are there any reasons youre seeing more strength in the larger transaction segments hessam nadji well we really saw kind of an unusual confluence of factors affecting the private client in the fourth quarter and that was the fact that interest rates have been extremely low for an extended period of time cap rates were at a record low and when you talk about the lower price points sub million of course especially the sub million the  basis point movement in the interest rates has a profound effect with the loan to values in the  to  range and remember the private client is affected with the personal wealth decisions and very direct investment decisions that affect their personal finances on the institutional side of course interest rates matter yields matter they have hurdles that they have to hit as well but when you look at the typical  million  million and above transaction on the institutional side those have loan to values of  to  and are less immediate interest rate sensitive in terms of a gono go investment decision and the effect on pricing brad burke okay i appreciate that and last one from me marty you touched on the balance sheet it looks like you have almost  million of cash and marketable securities so just how are you thinking about the magnitude that you need to maintain for cash and marketable securities just given the nature of your business and can you help us think about your timing on potentially either deploying that capital for external growth or returning capital to shareholders martin louie hi brad sure were constantly evaluating our cash balances and but the thing is that we’re looking at a couple of things one the current operations capital needs for the operations but also evaluating opportunistic acquisitions we’re actively looking at various scenarios and so we do understand the level of our cash balances and continue to address it with our board operator thank you the next question is from mitch germain of jmp group please go ahead mitch germain good afternoon everyone so hessam you talked about the challenging backdrop in q and im assuming a lot of your brokers are spending a lot of time keeping deals alive right so how much did that impact your forward pipeline hessam nadji good afternoon mitch it affected our forward pipeline quite a bit in that the time and energy it took to basically redo transactions that have already been done already and have to bring the parties back together considerable amount of renegotiations in many cases requalifying for the financing keeping the lender at the table keeping the buyer and seller at the table it was an unexpected amount of time and energy into transactions that were pretty much underway anyway so it had a pretty important effect on their productivity on new business development mitch germain got you and then i know that marty youve said in the past that the business is becoming a little less seasonal but how should we consider seasonality playing out martin louie i think what you need to do is listen back to what hessam said in regards to where the market is preliminary estimate is that going into q we’re seeing a negative  decrease in the market and our goal is always to slightly beat the market and gain share so that’s one way to look at it and then as well as i’ve said in the past in terms of seasonality the first quarter it typically ranges between  to  of this total year is probably going to be kind of in the middle of that if not a little bit better so and that’s kind of how you can see how the year plays out mitch germain and i am curious about your hiring  i think was the number you guys gave how much of that breakdown between experienced and entrylevel hessam nadji so i’ll jump in on that one mitch about roughly   to  of that hiring was experienced professionals that have had real estate experience and really the key factor for us is that and we’ve seen market adjustments in the past what’s really important for us is continuing to focus on the broader market opportunity i cited some statistics with  transactions last year  in that core  million to  million business looking beyond the current adjustment that’s going on in the marketplace and the headwinds that we’ve talked about we do believe that gaining more share and positioning the company for ongoing growth is very important so we’re not overreacting to what we’re seeing in the marketplace at this point by slowing the hiring down including the experienced agent hiring that’s been a very important strategy for us over the past couple of years and we’re continuing to focus on it mitch germain is the experience hiring reflective in how we should be thinking about cost of services ie experienced people higher payouts so your cost of services will get a little less leverage going forward hessam nadji maybe to a very minor extent number one in general number two remember that most of our focus of that majority of our experienced hiring focus is not on top level teams that require really a classic acquisitions they are midtier professionals that join because of the benefits of our platform therefore even though they do have little bit higher splits because of their experienced level they’re not really being acquired per se and in those cases where you have an acquisition formula in place those are very much tied to performance hurdles and revenue growth thresholds and so on so we’re continuing to take a very conservative stance at the cost of growth mitch germain got you i know peter has got one more for us thanks unidentified analyst hey guys yeah just one from me just given the focus on the technology upgrades and accounting for these increased costs from the growing footprint the research investment how should we view ga going into  or continuing through thanks martin louie yeah in terms of sga typically q tends to be about  higher than q because of some of these awards recognition programs that we have so typically q going into q is  higher than q and then for the rest of the year we estimate sga in total going to be in the  million to  million range and typically for the remaining three quarter they’re all pretty much consistent with each other operator thank you the next question is from josh lamers of william blair please go ahead josh lamers thanks good afternoon gentlemen a couple of broadbased questions here turning first to an mmcc looking out the last couple of years it looks as though the percentage of transactions there as a percent of overall transactions for the company has been rather stagnant i’m just wondering if looking ahead to   given some of the comments about focusing effort on that and growing mmcc if we should expect a percentage of finance transactions to be about in line with what it has been historically with brokerage transactions or whether you should start to see an increase hessam nadji great question looking backwards first the key focus for us over the past couple of years for mmcc was to really improve the quality of the professionals the infrastructure of mmcc and so the focus was really on internal improvements and the business unit has been growing very nicely but pretty much along the same pace as our overall business in  and beyond we’re looking to accelerate that it’s not going to happen overnight but there are two or three different initiatives going on that are very important related to mmcc first of all it’s our focus on more experienced people we’ve made a dramatic shift in the training of more experienced people just in the last really in the last  months and that hasn’t quite shown up in the numbers yet and it probably won’t until later in  going in to  it’s because of the transition that it takes and it’s more of a focus going forward in our hiring the second thing is that from a service offering perspective the correspondent relationships that i described earlier readycap on the small loans balance program the prudential relationship on the middle market and larger transactions those are the kind of strategic moves that we’re executing to basically expand our service offerings and so the broadening of the model the broadening of the tools that are available to our originators and the way that it can integrate better with our investment sales people is something that’s fairly new and therefore going forward we would expect better results in terms of the growth rate than your look back over the last two years josh lamers okay thank you and maybe just as a followon to that what are maybe some of the primary reasons that someone selling or buying a property would not utilize the services of the capital core hessam nadji well there is really no reason that they would not other than the fact that a lot of our clients historically have had relationships with other mortgage brokers those relationships tend to be longterm and they’re rather difficult to dislodge a lot of our clients have their go to person but overtime as our investment sales team begins to introduce their mmcc partner in the same office and as that partner becomes more experienced and more qualified and has a bigger book of business which creates more confidence these sort of interoffice relationships are becoming more and more integrated and that’s really the way that we’ve positioned mmcc internally externally we’re marketing mmcc as a competitive intermediary for the best financing to the marketplace so they’re focused also on developing business directly and on their own with their own marketing is also enhancing or basically improving and so it just goes back to that relationship building with both the borrower and in house with our investment sales team josh lamers thanks really helpful just one last quick one for me based on the market share comments at the beginning of the press release any thoughts on where you would like or where you hope to see market share go within the coming years hessam nadji well we’ve outlined market share growth by product type over the last couple of years and our overall  share in the  million to  million marketplace is nowhere near saturation just to give you an example which i’ve shared in the past on the apartment front which is of course our largest business segment our national market share is roughly  our top  offices have an average market share of  so looking at what is being accomplished by our leading offices we’re using that benchmark to basically inspire and execute a market share growth expansion plan for all of our offices so the potential to get up to   market share in apartments also has already been proven and that’s where we’re basically moving the company by property type but i will say as when i emphasize this market share doesn’t happen overnight i mean you have to hire the right people you have to train them you have to deploy them to the right components of a submarket in each metro so it’s a gradual process we’ve made tremendous progress in market share over the last couple of years but it is gradual and just want to emphasize that operator operator instructions the next question is form peter christiansen of citigroup please go ahead peter christiansen thank you gentlemen glad to be part of the mix first question i guess given the current environment should we think that you still need headcount growth to meet to continue market share gains or is there some element of attrition by your competitors hessam nadji hi peter well if we were to only react to the current market environment the real immediate let’s say next three to six months we would be making a mistake and im very passionate about the fact that there is  the market that we operated is so vast and so fragmented as i’ve shared before the top  brokers including ourselves have a  market share in a market that accounts for  of  transactions it’s a significant market opportunity for us so yes theres no doubt that what were experiencing right now is very challenging the headwinds are serious but weve seen market adjustments before weve seen market recalibration before weve seen the classic price expectation taking time on the seller side and the buyer expectations to basically have to adjust based on the fact that the market is still very healthy all of these classic things that we’ve experienced over  years are at play now and they can’t really deter us from pursuing this broader market opportunity so yes we could gain more market share with the current sales force that we have they’re very capable we’re training more and more of them but on top of that if we don’t add in a diversified fashion so that we don’t oversaturate a particular market with too many professionals and one product type and really pursue the expansion opportunities in let’s say the office market multitenant retail in many markets where our apartment salesforce could still grow if we don’t do those things then we’ll fall behind and we’re not going to do that and that’s why we’re seeing a very committed to our hiring goal peter christiansen thanks that is helpful and then i guess as it relates to the toughness that we saw in q i am assuming that some deals fell through of some of those was it more because of failure to requalify under the financing or is it more related to issues with the terms of the investment can you just give us a sense or characterization of why some deals fell through hessam nadji sure on the lending side lenders are very much at the table and they’re very competitive they do want to put capital to work but when you have the  basis point movement in interest rates that we talked about the way an appraiser or a lender is going to view the adjusted value versus and require more proceeds more equity from a buyer versus the seller’s expectation on having to adjust that products or the buyer’s expectation of having to step up is where the gap basically occurs and in this market environment where we’re not in a recession contrary to that the economy is actually growing we’re still adding jobs at a very nice pace occupancies are healthy cash flows are healthy so that overall if you will the stress in the market is nonexistent the sellers that we found unwilling to make the price adjustment basically couldn’t come to terms with the fact that a discount was necessary in order to make the deal happen a lot of deals have been priced to perfection so there wasn’t a whole lot of margin if any in many of these transactions remember the cap rates have been at the historical low and so there has  because of the fact that there is no distress in the marketplace there was not the willingness to discount the assets now because of the fact that conditions are changing because of the fact that interest rates are going up i go back to my comment about the classic adjustment both in terms of the seller’s expectation on pricing and the psychology that goes with that and buyer’s expectation these things just have to have time to basically come together and more data points and that’s why the uncertainty related to tax reform is a significant factor right now peter christiansen i guess relating to that i mean the assumption is that we should get some more clarity some point late spring and then i guess into the early fall do you think that those on the sideline have a timeline around getting that clarity and is there a potential that if something were to slip that they would still go forward or are they is it  there isnt that much of a countdown i guess on their end hessam nadji it is very dangerous to speculate at a broad level like this and we were talking about very general trends i mean there is so many nuances in every person’s decision making and every asset and its performance i can’t really make a general statement to that operator thank you the next question is from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani thanks for taking the question just wondering if you give a bit more color on the difference in growth rate you saw between the large deal size and your other business lines or channels do you think that deal timeline  presumably it takes longer to close a large transaction  do you think that played into a factor and in the first quarter do you expect the large transaction group to more closely resemble the pace of volume that youre seeing in the private client group and the other channels thank you hessam nadji sure your comment is accurate that the deal timelines did play a role in more of the larger deals closing in the fourth quarter plus the fact that as i mentioned earlier the effective interest rate spike was more minimal on the larger transactions i don’t want to underplay the fact that interest rates increasing affects all client categories from the largest institutions to the smallest private clients it clearly does but when you look at the loan to value ratios of  to  it’s just not as profound on a  million or  million transaction that makes up the bread and butter of the company’s core business so there were some differences there i can’t give you any guidance on the first quarter but i will tell you that if you look at the last couple of years’ growth rate that we’ve achieved through various initiatives whether it’s expansion of our ipa division that’s focused more on institutional investors and major private investors and experienced senior level marcus  millichap agents doing larger transaction the growth rates in the last couple of years have been exceptional and it would be unwise to expect those kind of breakneck paces to continue going forward it is a part of our growth plan we are very committed to making sure that our larger accounts segment continues to grow it’s very important for our retention from a career development of our agents and client retention i do want to emphasize that a lot of our private clients now look to consolidate smaller assets in their portfolio into one or two larger assets and that gives us a very important competitive advantage in bringing the private capital buyer to our institutional clients so it’s an important part of our strategy but the growth rates of the past especially several quarters have been quite exceptional jade rahmani and just a followup you disclosed that in dollar volumes about  is the multifamily sector does the other segment which is about  does that include condo thanks for taking the questions hessam nadji i’m sorry i couldn’t hear does that include what jade rahmani condos condo buildings condo developments hessam nadji i see we don’t sell individual condos that is not part of our specialty and so all of our multifamily market rate investments are basically rental property operator thank you there are no further questions in queue at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks hessam nadji thank you operator and thank you for joining our call we appreciate your attendance and the great questions that were asked and we look forward to having you on our first quarter  call thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your

millichap ceo hessam nadji nrei spoke with nadji about his work over the past year his next steps in growing marcus  millichap and how the firm is navigating the current market environment diana bell  may   it’s been one year since hessam nadji took the helm at national brokerage firm marcus  millichap and it’s been quite a busy period nadji’s oneyear anniversary comes just as the commercial real estate industry finds itself in a period of regulatory and economic uncertainty and declining investment sales activity but nadji has been through a few market cycles by now he joined the firm as vice president of research in  and helped marcus  millichap grow to being an investment advisory practice in addition to a brokerage services provider he then rose to chief marketing officer with responsibility for expanding the marcus  millichap brand before ultimately being appointed ceo in april  as chief marketing officer nadji launched the firm’s institutional property advisers division and prepared the company for its  ipo nrei spoke with nadji about his work over the past year his next steps in growing marcus  millichap and how the firm is navigating the current market environment here is an edited transcript of the interview nrei how would you describe your first year at the helm of marcus  millichap what were the biggest challenges you faced in the ceo role hessam nadji it has been an incredible year my biggest frustration is that there’s only  hours in a day we have an aggressive longterm growth agenda in a large and fragmented market and our team is charged up to grow smartly strategically in the immediate term the market is facing some headwinds and uncertainty related to tax reform and economic stimuli promised by the new administration so there is a bit of a pause in the market until we see some clarity on these we continue to hire and train agents invest in new technology and support systems and essentially build toward the longterm nrei what if any were the first significant changes you made as ceo hessam nadji the most important things we’ve done since april of  when marcus  millichap’s new leadership team was formed including myself as ceo and mitch labar a company veteran as coo were we have streamlined the management team including expanded responsibility for our best managers who now oversee synergistic divisions which include seven to nine offices on average we held a series of broker forums client forums and traveled to offices throughout the country to get a fresh idea of what is happening among our sales force what they wanted and needed we also used direct feedback from clients to zero in on market challenges and opportunities and set our priorities for developing new tools and improving the company accordingly we have brought in fresh thinking and talent through a number of experienced brokers we have hired and a new head of technology we’ve added to our research products and expanded our branding by further partnering with key industry groups in each product line for example we have an extensive and growing presence at icsc to support our retail division and nmhc is a key partner that we support for the betterment of the apartment industry we are deeply involved with naiop as part of our officeindustrial strategy and the same goes for hospitality seniors housing student housing selfstorage and so on our brand is growing rapidly through these efforts and most importantly we are facilitating face time between our sales teams and decision makers our investment in technology upgrades focuses on the productivity of our sales force and enabling better outreach to clients we’ve spent time and energy upgrading our electronic marketing platform by partnering with constant contact at an enterprise level the second major step involved in modernizing one of our key inhouse proprietary applications is our introduction of a webbased mobile system called mnetoffering that automates the process of compiling market information financial analysis and property information including images into client proposals and marketing packages the feedback on time saving and quality of output has been great last but not least we are upgrading our technology infrastructure connecting our  offices with updated tools for video conferencing streaming and data sharing nrei what are your longterm goals for the firms growth and expansion hessam nadji longterm we are expanding marcus  millichap as a platform to service both private clients and institutional investors we are wellestablished in the private client segment which typically consists of smaller properties valued at under  million this market segment is vast but very fragmented with the top  brokerage companies including us accounting for  percent share of transactions that occur this gives us room to expand our private client market share which is still our biggest growth opportunity at the same time we launched a special division of the company about five years ago called institutional property advisors to cater to large institutional investors this has been wellreceived by the marketplace because we are able to bring relatively unknown private investors to institutionalquality assets being public for three years has helped to increase our profile and the awareness of our company is helping us expose our brand to larger clients and attract more experienced brokers last but not least we continue to grow our financing division marcus  millichap capital corp mmcc nrei could you tell us more about mmcc hessam nadji mmcc now has approximately  financing specialists we recently announced correspondent relationships with readycap for smallbalance multifamily loans and pgim the financing arm of prudential for midmarket and larger multifamily financing solutions these partners’ access to agency debt and a host of other capabilities are now being offered by our team to our clients that is just one example of the types of initiatives we have launched to augment client services and grow the company nrei how would you describe the current economic landscape as it relates to commercial real estate hessam nadji the market has had an intense runup in sales activity and values over the last five years and that type of velocity is hard to maintain we are seeing some pause as i mentioned earlier as investors are asking “what will tax reform look like” given that real estate fundamentals are very healthy and there is no distress in the market sellers have been reluctant to discount assets while buyers are looking for lower prices to accommodate higher perceived risk i would expect that over the next few months buyers and sellers will recalibrate expectations especially if there is clarity on tax reform and infrastructure spending that alone could result in higher activity but with no evidence of a recession around the corner and steady job growth i expect this cycle to have more runway economically and within the real estate sector nrei where in the cycle are we right now hessam nadji we are now in year seven of the expansion and the average expansion since  has lasted five and a half years by that measure we are overdue for a recession but average job growth annually has been  percent in this cycle that compares to the average percent job growth cycles since  we’ve benefited from a slower pace which doesn’t overheat the economy we are starting to see wage growth and inflation pick up and the fed moving to keep inflation in check this points to ongoing strength it’s not a boom but more of the “steady as she goes” scenario nrei have you made any preparations in case of a real estate downturn hessam nadji for us it’s all about building for the longterm sticking it out with our clients and taking care of their needs through the ups and downs of the market we stay close to them keep them informed and provide the investment options that fit their needs a lot of investors are opting for different product types that offer higher yields or geographic markets our job is to expand their investment options and maximize their value cycles come and go but relationships endure nrei please tell us your thoughts on the role of technology in the commercial real estate business how have you incorporated technological innovation into the daytoday operations at marcus  millichap hessam nadji if you look at how the industry has evolved over time the traditional sales process in the brokerage business has been significantly changed by technology market research and modern practices in what makes a broker more productive data is no longer “the magic” like it was  or even  years ago interpretation of realtime events and anticipation of how consumer preferences and therefore investor demands are going to change is now the magic of good brokerage and let’s not underestimate the power of a broker’s relationships and client trust which still govern the real estate business data technology and analytics have merged with the art of service and proactive client care and that is what our company is all about as an example of incorporating technological innovation into the daytoday we recently launched mnetoffering as i mentioned earlier which is a proprietary webbased application designed to support sales agents in the creation of electronic and print materials chiefly offering memorandums and asset valuations that are critical to help clients in the investment decisionmaking process mnetoffering is one of several initiatives underway to enhance our brokerage tools agent support and client services since our entire business model was built on information sharing technology has played a big role for us and that is still the case but it also takes a certain culture an understanding among our team as to the true value of information sharing for the benefit of our clients tags news  comments hide comments comment  more information about
