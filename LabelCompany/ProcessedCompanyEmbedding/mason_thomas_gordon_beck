optical modulator  the laser source  is a widely tunable semiconductor laser that is comprised of an active region on top of a thick low bandgap waveguide layer  wherein both the waveguide layer  and the active region are fabricated between a pdoped region and an ndoped region an electroabsorption modulator  is integrated into the semiconductor laser  wherein the electroabsorption modulator  shares the waveguide layer  with the semiconductor laser type grant filed august   date of patent march   assignee the regents of the university of california inventors thomas gordon beck mason larry a coldren gregory fish integrated wavelength tunable single and twostage alloptical wavelength converter patent number  abstract a semiconductor tunable laser  and an interferometer  coupled to the tunable laser  are monolithically fabricated in a semiconductor heterostructure the laser also comprises a buried ridge stripe waveguide laser the interferometer  has a semiconductor optical amplifier  coupled in each arm a crossgain semiconductor optical amplifier converter is coupled to the interferometer  the semiconductor optical amplifier  coupled in each arm is biased so that an optical path length difference between the two arms is in antiphase which results in destructive interference the output of the tunable laser  is coupled to a coupler a semiconductor optical amplifier  is used as a gain controller for the semiconductor optical amplifiers in the interferometer  to allow wavelength conversion over a larger range of input signal powers type grant filed september   date of patent december   assignee the regents of the university of california inventors thomas gordon beck mason gregory fish daniel j blumenthal segmented modulator for highspeed optoelectronics patent number  abstract an optical modulator includes first and second modulator segments the first and second modulator segments form an optical signal path for an optical signal the optical modulator also includes an electrical signal path capable of receiving and carrying a modulation signal which is applied to the optical signal at the first and second modulation segments to generate a modulated optical signal an inductive element may be disposed between electrical inputs to the first and second modulator segments the optical modulator may be an electroabsorption modulator eam the inductive element may be an inductor or a transmission line segment type grant filed june   date of patent january   assignee triquint technology holding co inventors john michael geary joseph michael freund frank stephen walters thomas gordon beck mason charles william lentz electroabsorption modulator with tunable chirp patent number  abstract an electroabsorption modulator comprises a tandem arrangement of a conventional electroabsorption ea modulator element and a phase modulator element the ea modulator element is driven by the digital data signal and the phase modulator is driven by a chirp tuning control signal such as the complement of the data signal by controlling the amplitude andor bias of the chirp tuning control signal the frequency chirp of the intensitymodulated output signal from the ea modulator element can be controlled type grant filed august   date of patent august   assignee triquint technology holding co inventors joseph michael freund thomas gordon beck mason joseph patrick reynolds robert ehrler tench frank stephen walters tunable laser source with an integrated wavelength monitor and method of operating same patent number  abstract a wavelength monitor is provided based on the transmission response of an optical filter the monitor provides feedback to the laser enabling it to lock to any given wavelength within its tuning range the invention is also a process for integrating the wavelength monitor directly on chip with a variety of tunable semiconductor lasers the invention also comprises a method for controlling the wavelength of a tunable laser by using a wavelength monitor to measure the output light and provide feedback to a control system the laser and wavelength monitor are integrated together on a single indium phosphide chip the wavelength monitor comprises a filter with a wavelength dependent transmission function and a pair of detectors one detector is illuminated with light that has passed through the filter and the other provides a reference to measure the input intensity taking the ratio of the filtered light level to the unfiltered light provides a wavelength dependent wavelength type grant filed january   date of patent march
