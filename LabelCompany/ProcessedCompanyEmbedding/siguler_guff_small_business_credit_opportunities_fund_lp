over equity investors and in some cases over junior subordinated lenders the fund’s mezzanine loans will typically have a stated term of  years with a “bullet” maturity meaning that while the lender pays periodic interest payments over the term of the loan the entire principal amount is due only at maturity mezzanine loans frequently require that the borrower pay a prepayment fee which could be substantial to make a full or partial voluntary repayment of the loan prior to maturity prepayment fees may also apply to mandatory prepayments such as prepayments upon a change in control   mezzanine loans generally provide for a portion of the interest due to be paid in cash periodically typically on a monthly basis the “cash coupon” with the remainder “paid in kind” meaning that the accrued interest is added to the outstanding principal the “pik coupon” in addition to interest payments and prepayment fees mezzanine loans often require borrowers to pay origination structuring or commitment fees as well as the lender’s legal and other outofpocket fees   mezzanine loans are subordinate to more senior indebtedness and certain senior indebtedness will have security interests in property of the borrower which could make that property unavailable to satisfy claims by the mezzanine lender  the mezzanine lender generally will enter into an intercreditor agreement with the more senior lenders which may limit or delay the ability of the mezzanine lender to receive payment following a default under the senior credit facility limit or delay the mezzanine lender’s ability to exercise its rights upon a default under the mezzanine debt facility and otherwise limit the mezzanine lender’s rights   unitranche loans unitranche also called “onestop” loans combine senior and subordinated debt in one facility unitranche loans are typically issued under a single set of documents and carry a single “blended” interest rate which may be fixed or floating derived from both the senior and subordinated tranches unitranche loans are backed by a first lien on specific assets of the borrower unitranche loans typically have a term of five years with amortization over the term of the loan and prepayment permissible although with some prepayment fees   unitranche loans may involve fees from the borrower that are similar to those of mezzanine debt representations and covenants are generally more restrictive than those for mezzanine debt and include covenants relating to maintenance and preservation of collateral because the senior and subordinated indebtedness are owned by the same lender documentation generally is less complex and detailed   second lien loans second lien loans are secured loans with security interests subordinate to the borrower’s senior secured debt thus second lien loans generally rank between senior secured and mezzanine debt and are often used to fill a gap in the available financing for a transaction in some cases second lien loans are subordinate to senior secured debt with respect to shared collateral but hold the primary lien with respect to other collateral similar to mezzanine loans the holders of second lien loans typically enter into an intercreditor agreement with the senior secured and mezzanine debtholders which may limit the rights of the second lien loan holder vis a vis the senior secured debtholders particularly with respect to acceleration and foreclosure on collateral second lien loans may involve fees from the borrower that are similar to those of other tiers of debt representations and covenants are generally more restrictive than those for mezzanine debt and include covenants relating to maintenance and preservation of collateral  equity securities the fund will frequently acquire equity securities of a borrower in connection with a mezzanine or unitranche loan these will typically be coinvestments made alongside the equity sponsor the fund will typically acquire convertible or participating preferred stock although the fund may acquire common stock the fund typically will acquire the same or similar equity securities as those owned by the equity sponsor of the borrower   when the fund acquires an equity security it typically will become a party to a shareholder agreement between the fund and the other shareholders of the borrower and a registration rights agreement granting shareholders the right under specified circumstances and subject to specified limitations to cause the company to register the shareholders’ securities for sale under the  act   the fund will seek board observer rights with each investment that it makes in times of financial distress or other situations involving a conflict of interest between a borrower and the fund the fund’s representative would recuse itself from the relevant board meetings and information flows because the fund will typically own a relatively small percentage of the total equity of a borrower its ability to negotiate the terms of a shareholder agreement generally will be limited and the fund typically will have limited corporate governance rights and limited ability to cause the company or other shareholders to engage in exit transactions such as a sale of the company or an initial public offering   warrants to acquire equity securities in lieu of or in addition to acquiring equity securities of a borrower in connection with a mezzanine or unitranche loan the fund might acquire warrants to acquire equity securities   the equity securities issuable upon the exercise of warrants generally will have the characteristics described under “equity securities” above   special situations the fund may invest up to  of its aggregate investments determined cumulatively over the life of the fund in special situation investments including investments in secondary transactions special situation investments may be structured as senior debt convertible debt or other debtequity structures in addition special situations could include investments in a “troubled” company undergoing a restructuring or recapitalization of its existing debt or equity and making investments in subordinated debt providing bridge financing to a company which is in the process of raising additional private equity planning an initial public offering or is seeking to enter into a business combination through which it would be acquired   convertible preferred securities and convertible debt  the fund may provide mezzanine financing in the form of convertible preferred securities or convertible debt convertible preferred securities may contain provisions comparable to those of mezzanine debt but rank lower in seniority to all debt of the issuer and lack the covenant provisions that benefit debt securities income to the fund from preferred securities is paid in the form of dividends rather than interest dividends unlike interest are payable only if declared by the borrower’s board of directors and might not be legally payable if the borrower is unprofitable or if prohibited by the terms of the borrower’s agreements with lenders  investment policies and restrictions   diversification standards the fund will be classified as a “nondiversified” closedend investment company under the  act until the fund qualifies as a regulated investment company “ric” it will not be subject to the diversification requirements applicable to rics under the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” commencing with the partnership’s first capital call the investment manager will seek to increase the diversification of the fund’s portfolio so as to make it possible commencing with its second year of investment operations to meet the ric diversification requirements as described below there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to meet those requirements   to qualify as a ric the fund must meet the issuer diversification standards under the code that require that at the close of each quarter of the fund’s taxable year a at least  of the value of the fund’s total assets is represented by i cash and cash items us government securities and securities of other rics and ii other securities counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed  of the value of the fund’s total assets and the fund does not own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities and b not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested in i the securities other than us government securities and securities of other rics of any one issuer ii the securities other than securities of other rics of two or more issuers that the fund controls defined as  or more of the voting power and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or iii the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships for more information about the requirements imposed on rics under the code please see the disclosure under the caption “taxation”   industry segment concentration the fund will seek to invest no more that  of its total assets in securities of companies in any single industry segment the broad industry categories in which the fund anticipates that most of the investments will fall and within each of which there may be several “segments” for purposes of the industry diversification policy include industrial goods and services consumer products oil and gasrelated products and services health care food and beverage technology and media the industry segment concentration requirements will not require that the fund divest securities in its portfolio because of a subsequent change in the value of securities the fund has previously acquired   investment guidelines in selecting investments for the fund’s portfolio the investment manager will endeavor to meet the investment guidelines as established by the fund’s board of directors however the fund may make investments that do not conform to one or more of these guidelines when deemed appropriate by the investment manager such investments might be made if the investment manager believes that a failure to conform in one area is offset by exceptional strength in another or is compensated for by a higher yield favorable equity or warrant issuance or other attractive transaction terms or features   in general the fund will pursue the following investment guidelines   · the fund will invest in later stage profitable companies typically with ebitda between  million and with revenue between  million   · companies may use the capital for a range of purposes including but not limited to change of control transactions organic growth acquisition debt refinancing and dividend recapitalizations   · the fund will invest in companies that the investment manager considers to have stable operating performance and a strong position in their respective markets underwriting criteria may include some or all of the following   ° historical profitability with predictable cash flow and realistic growth prospects   ° strong management team with incentives to perform  ° good strategic position in the market with high barriers to entry reasonable customer concentration risk and a differentiated product or service   ° strong operating performance with good margins   ° strong balance sheet and liquidity   ° good reputation among customers and suppliers and   ° backing by a highquality financial sponsor   · transaction guidelines will include   ° debt investments ranging from  million   ° equity investments totaling up to  of the total investment in a deal   ° sufficient cash flow to cover debt service expense and   ° underwriting parameters will be set and regularly reviewed by the investment manager and team and may include maximum leverage multiples minimum debt service coverage ratios and minimum capitalization requirements   international investments with certain exceptions as a bdc the fund may invest no more than  of its total assets in companies which are not “eligible portfolio companies” an “eligible portfolio company” must be organized under the laws of and have its principal place of business in the united states therefore the fund could invest up to but no more than  of its total assets in foreign based companies it is anticipated that the majority of nonus investments would be in companies doing business in north america or western europe these requirements generally will not require the fund to divest an investment if this threshold is exceeded due to market movements   leverage the fund intends to borrow money from and issue debt securities to banks insurance companies and other lenders to obtain additional funds to originate loans if such borrowings are available on terms that are acceptable to the investment manager and the board of directors of the fund it is possible in the event of the tightening of the credit markets that the fund may not be able to secure such borrowings on acceptable terms see the discussion at item la under the captions “risk factors – general economic market and political conditions” and “risk factors  regulatory risks” the fund may also seek to obtain leverage from the us small business administration the “sba” by forming a subsidiary that will obtain a license as a small business investment company an “sbic” see the discussion at item a under the caption “risk factors  risks associated with the fund’s sbic subsidiaries” any borrowings of the fund other than those through its sbic if one is formed will be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the  act see the discussion below under the caption “regulation” the use of leverage increases investment risk see the discussion at item la under the caption “risk factors  leverage”   temporary investments pending investment and until distributions to the stockholders are made the fund and the partnership will invest excess cash in i time deposits certificates of deposit and similar instruments of highlyrated banks ii securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities iii repurchase agreements that are a issued by highlyrated banks or securities dealers and b fully collateralized by us government securities iv shortterm highquality debt instruments of us corporations and v money market funds and other pooled investment funds whose investments are restricted to those described above the average maturity of such investments weighted by their par value will not exceed  days  other investment policies the fund will not sell securities short except to the extent the fund has a warrant for or owns shares equal to the number of shares which is the subject of the proposed short sale purchase securities on margin except to the extent the fund’s permitted borrowings are deemed to constitute margin purchases purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts except interest rate hedging transactions in connection with the fund’s permitted borrowings or purchase or sell real estate the fund may however write puts and calls and acquire options as a hedge for equity investments and to increase return through a covered call the fund will not underwrite the securities of other companies except to the extent it may be deemed an underwriter upon the disposition of restricted securities acquired in the ordinary course of its business the fund may however use borrowed funds for its lending activities see the discussion at item a under the caption “risk factors  leverage”   the fund’s investment objectives investment policies and investment guidelines other than its status as a bdc are not fundamental policies and may be changed by the fund’s board of directors at any time   regulation   the fund   after filing an election to be treated as a bdc a company may not withdraw its election without securing the approval of the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities as defined under the  act  the following is a brief description of the bdc regime under the  act and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the  act and the rules thereunder   generally to be eligible to elect bdc status a company must engage in the business of furnishing capital and offering significant managerial assistance to eligible portfolio companies more specifically in order to qualify as a bdc a company must i be a domestic company ii have registered a class of its securities or have filed a registration statement with the sec pursuant to section  of the  act iii operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of eligible portfolio companies iv either make available significant managerial assistance to such eligible portfolio companies or the eligible portfolio company x has total assets of not more than  million and capital and surplus of not less than  million or y meets such criteria as the sec otherwise may provide v have a majority of disinterested directors and vi file or under certain circumstances intend to file a proper notice of election with the sec   “making available significant managerial assistance” is defined under the  act in relevant part as i an arrangement whereby the bdc through its officers directors employees or general partners offers to provide and if accepted does provide significant guidance and counsel concerning the management operations or business objectives of a portfolio company or ii the exercise by a bdc of a controlling influence over the management or polices of the portfolio company by the bdc acting individually or as part of a group acting together which controls the portfolio company the officers of the fund and the officers of the investment manager on behalf of the fund intend to offer to provide managerial assistance including advice on equipment acquisition and financing cash flow and expense management general financing opportunities acquisition opportunities and opportunities to access the public securities markets to the great majority of companies to whom the fund provides financing the right to offer such assistance will typically be provided in the negotiated documents for the loan transactions in some instances officers of the fund may serve on the board of directors of borrowers or of companies in which it makes an equity investment  an “eligible portfolio company” is a domestic company with its principal place of business in the united states that is not an investment company as defined in the  act or excluded from the definition of an investment company by section c of the  act and that either i does not have a class of securities registered on a national securities exchange or does have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and nonvoting common equity of less than  million or ii is actively controlled by a bdc and has an affiliate of a bdc on the eligible portfolio company’s board of directors iii has total assets of not more than  million and capital and surplus of not less than  million or iv meets such other criteria as may be established by the sec control under the  act is presumed to exist where a bdc owns more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the eligible portfolio company   the  act prohibits or restricts bdcs from investing in certain types of companies such as brokerage firms insurance companies investment banking firms and investment companies moreover the  act limits the type of assets that bdcs may acquire to certain prescribed “qualifying assets” and certain assets necessary for its operations such as office furniture equipment and facilities if at the time of acquisition less than  of the value of the bdc’s assets consist of qualifying assets qualifying assets include i privately acquired securities of companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time such bdc acquired their securities ii securities of bankrupt or insolvent companies iii securities of eligible portfolio companies controlled by a bdc iv securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to any of the foregoing and v cash items government securities and highquality shortterm debt also included in qualifying assets are followon investments in a company that met the definition of eligible portfolio company at the time of the fund’s initial investment but subsequently does not meet such definition because it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange if at the time of the followon investment the fund a owns at least  of i the greatest number of equity securities of such company including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities and ii the greatest amount of certain debt securities of such company held by the fund at any time during the period when such company was an eligible portfolio company and b is one of the twenty largest holders of record of the company’s outstanding voting securities the  act also places restrictions on the nature of transactions in which and the persons from whom securities can be purchased in order for the securities to be considered qualifying assets such restrictions include limiting purchases to transactions not involving a public offering   the fund upon election as a bdc may sell its securities at a price that is below its net asset value per share under limited circumstances these include certain types of rights offerings as well as offerings approved by a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors upon their determination that such sale would be in the best interests of the fund and its stockholders and upon the approval by the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities including a majority of the voting securities held by nonaffiliated persons of the policy or practice of making such sales within one year of such sale a majority of the disinterested directors also must determine in good faith in consultation with the underwriters of the offering if the offering is underwritten that the price of the securities being sold is not less than a price which closely approximates market value of the securities less any distribution discounts or commissions as defined in the  act the term “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the fund means the vote of i  or more of the shares present at a meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy or ii more than  of outstanding shares whichever is less  many of the transactions involving a company and its affiliates as well as affiliates of those affiliates which are prohibited without the prior approval of the sec for registered investment companies are permissible for bdcs including the fund upon the prior approval of a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors and a majority of the directors having no financial interest in the transactions some transactions however involving certain persons related to the fund including its directors officers the investment manager and the partnership may still require the prior approval of the sec in general i any person who owns controls or holds power to vote more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares ii any director executive officer or general partner of a person described in clause i and iii any person who directly or indirectly controls is controlled by or is under common control with a person described in clause i must obtain the prior approval of a majority of the fund’s disinterested directors and in some situations the prior approval of the sec before engaging in certain transactions with the fund or any company controlled by the fund other persons such as persons who control the bdc and certain persons under common control with the bdc must seek prior approval of the sec for certain transactions the  act generally does not restrict transactions between the fund and its eligible portfolio companies absent some other prohibited affiliation because siguler guff as defined below in item  is a private equity sponsor with other products and lines of business these restrictions may limit the investment opportunities that are made available to the fund while a bdc may change the nature of its business so as to cease being a bdc and in connection therewith withdraw its election to be treated as a bdc only if authorized to do so by a majority vote as defined by the  act of its outstanding voting securities shareholder approval of changes in other fundamental investment policies of a bdc is not required in contrast to the general  act requirement which requires shareholder approval for a change in any fundamental investment policy   under  the   act the  fund  may  not  incur borrowings  unless immediately after  the  borrowing is incurred such borrowings would have “asset  coverage” of at least  “asset coverage” means the ratio which the value of the fund’s total assets less all liabilities not represented by liabilities constituting “senior securities” under the  act bears to the aggregate amount of such borrowings and senior securities the practical effect of this restriction is to limit the fund’s borrowings and other senior securities to  of its total assets less its liabilities other than the borrowings and other senior securities the  act also requires that with respect to certain types of indebtedness provisions be made to prohibit the declaration of any dividend or other distribution on the shares other than a dividend payable in shares or the repurchase by the fund of shares if after payment of such dividend or repurchase of shares the asset coverage of such borrowings would be below  if the fund is unable to pay dividends or distributions in the amounts required under the code it may not be able to qualify for the passthrough status as a ric or if qualified to continue to so qualify if the fund establishes an sbic borrowings by the sbic will not be counted against the fund’s regulatory leverage limitations   the sbic subsidiary   the fund may make investments in qualifying small businesses through a whollyowned subsidiary the “sbic subsidiary” which will apply to be licensed by the sba to act as an sbic and as a result will be subject to sba regulations the rules and regulations governing sbics including the controlling statute the small business investment act of  as amended the “sbic act” are lengthy and complex the fund will provide a copy of the rules and regulations to any prospective investor upon request additional information about sbics may also be found on the sba’s website at httpwwwsbagovinv   taxation   the following discussion summarizes certain us federal income tax consequences which may be relevant to prospective investors the discussion is based upon the code treasury regulations administrative rulings court cases and other applicable law all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect  the summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to invest in the fund in addition except to the extent specifically addressed below it does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors some of which may be subject to special tax rules such as governmental entities bank holding companies insurance companies organizations exempt from taxation nonus persons and passthrough entities including partnerships and entities and arrangements classified as partnerships for us federal tax purposes or investors in such entities such investors should consult their own tax advisers as to the applicability of such special rules in addition the discussion does not address the state local or nonus tax consequences of an investment in the fund all prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers about the us federal state local nonus and other tax consequences of purchasing and holding and disposing of shares   taxation of the fund as an ordinary corporation   it is anticipated that commencing with the second year of its investment operations the fund will seek to meet the requirements including diversification requirements to qualify for the special passthrough status available to rics under the code and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to stockholders unless and until the fund meets these requirements it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year even if that income is distributed to the stockholders and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the stockholders as dividends thus such income will be subject to two layers of tax although corporate stockholders may be entitled to a dividendsreceived deduction there is no assurance that the fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a ric   taxation of the fund as a ric   consequences of converting from an ordinary corporation to a ric in order to qualify as a ric the fund must at the end of the first year in which it so qualifies have no accumulated earnings and profits from years in which it was not taxed as a ric to meet this requirement the fund must before the end of the first year in which it qualifies as a ric distribute as dividends all of its accumulated earnings and profits in addition to the foregoing pursuant to the treasury regulations the fund must either i recognize gain on the disposition of any asset during the subsequent recognition period generally  years the “recognition period” beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the fund qualifies for passthrough status as a ric that is held by the fund as of the beginning of such recognition period to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over b the fund’s adjusted tax basis in such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period such excess hereinafter “builtin gain” taxable at the highest regular corporate rates or ii elect to immediately recognize and pay tax on any such builtin gain with respect to any of its portfolio holdings and as described above distribute the earnings and profits from such deemed sales as a ric the fund generally would not be able to use any net operating loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to the first year in which the fund qualifies as a ric   ric qualification requirements in order to qualify as a ric under subchapter m of the code the fund must among other things  at all times during the taxable year have a valid and effective election to be a bdc under sections f and  of the  act  derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including gains from options futures and forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership as defined in section h of the code  diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each taxable year  a at least  of the value of the fund’s total assets is represented by i cash and cash items us government securities and securities of other rics and ii other securities counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed  of the value of the fund’s total assets and the fund does not own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities and b not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested in i the securities other than us government securities and securities of other rics of any one issuer ii the securities other than securities of other rics of two or more issuers that the fund controls defined as  or more of the voting power and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or iii the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships and  file an election to be a ric  if the fund qualifies as a ric and properly distributes to its stockholders each taxable year an amount equal to or exceeding the sum of   of its “investment company taxable income” as that term is defined in the code which includes among other things dividends taxable interest and the excess of any net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses as reduced by certain deductible expenses without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and   of the excess of its gross taxexempt interest if any over certain disallowed deductions the fund generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income of the fund including “net capital gain” the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss distributed to the stockholders however if the fund meets such distribution requirements and thus is eligible for passthrough status but chooses to retain some portion of its investment company taxable income or net capital gain it generally will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on the amount retained a distribution of warrants or equity investments to its stockholders will be treated as a sale by the fund of such assets with the excess of the fair market value of those assets over their tax basis being the amount of the income or gain to the fund arising from the distribution   if after initially qualifying as a ric the fund fails to qualify as a ric that is eligible for passthrough status for any taxable year it will be treated as a us corporation subject to us federal income tax thereby subjecting any income earned by the fund to tax at the corporate level and to a further tax at the stockholder level when such income is distributed in such a case there may be substantial tax and other costs associated with requalifying as a ric   if the fund qualifies as a ric the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax “excise tax” to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least  of its ordinary income for such calendar year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending on october  of such calendar year plus certain other undistributed amounts for these purposes any taxable income retained by the fund and on which it pays federal income tax will be treated as having been distributed   the fund currently intends to distribute in each year for which it qualifies as a ric substantially all of its net investment income and capital gain net income so as not to be subject to either federal income tax or excise tax   effect of certain investments and investment practices the fund’s activities generally may be unlike the typical activities engaged in by most investment companies that seek to qualify as rics for federal income tax purposes certain aspects of these activities may at times make it more difficult for the fund to satisfy the requirements for qualifying as a ric than is the case for other investment companies for example because the fund generally will call capital from the partnership on an “as needed” basis and will have relatively few investments in its early period of operations the fund will not be holding substantial amounts of “cash and cash items” that could be counted towards the fund’s ric diversification requirements as noted above it is anticipated that the fund will not meet the ric requirements and in particular the diversification requirement until the second year of its investment operations and there is no assurance that the fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a ric within that timeframe  to the extent that the terms of certain loans provide for the receipt by the fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term known as residual income the fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan and to include such accrued income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year thus in order to meet the distribution requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or the excise tax on undistributed income the fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives those distributions will be made from the fund’s cash assets from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds   taxation of the fund’s stockholders if the fund qualifies as a ric   general generally dividends paid to the stockholders that are attributable to the fund’s net investment income which for this purpose includes net shortterm capital gains will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income since the fund’s income is expected to be derived primarily from sources that do not pay “qualified dividend income” such dividends generally will not qualify for the maximum  federal income tax rate available to individuals on qualified dividend income capital gain distributions are taxable to stockholders as longterm capital gains regardless of how long the stockholder has held its shares it is not anticipated that a significant portion of the fund’s dividends will qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate stockholders   distributions are generally includible in the income of the stockholders at the time the distribution is received any distribution however declared by the fund as of a record date in october november or december and paid to the stockholders the following january is deemed to have been paid by the fund and received by the stockholders on december  of the year declared for both federal income and excise tax purposes this will prevent the application of the excise tax discussed above to the fund as a result of certain delays in the payment of the dividends   if for any calendar year the fund’s total distributions exceed its current and accumulated earnings and profits the excess will generally be considered a taxfree return of capital to the stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s adjusted basis in its shares and then as capital gain the amount treated as taxfree return of capital will reduce the adjusted tax basis of the stockholders’ shares thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss on the sale of the shares   in general upon the sale or other disposition of shares the seller will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and its adjusted basis in the shares any loss on the sale recognized will be disallowed to the extent the seller has acquired or entered into a contract to acquire substantially identical shares within a period beginning  days before the disposition and ending  days after the disposition in such case the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss gain or loss realized upon a sale of shares generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss the gain or loss will be a longterm capital gain or loss if the shares were held for more than one year in addition if the shares sold were not held for more than six months any loss on the sale will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividend received by the seller with respect to such shares   the fund is required to withhold  of reportable payments which may include dividends and capital gain distributions to us individuals and certain other us noncorporate stockholders who do not provide the fund with a correct taxpayer identification number on irs form w or who otherwise are subject to backup withholding each nonus stockholder will need to provide the appropriate irs form w wben weci wimy or wexp to demonstrate it is not subject to backup withholding  the fund will notify stockholders following the end of each calendar year of the amounts of dividends and capital gain distributions paid or deemed paid during the year   certain considerations for taxexempt investors qualified plans individuals retirement accounts and investors exempt from taxation under section c of the code collectively “taxexempt entities” are generally exempt from taxation except to the extent that they have “unrelated business taxable income” “ubti” determined in accordance with sections  of the code if the fund qualifies as a ric it is likely that distributions by the fund to a stockholder that is a taxexempt entity that are treated as dividends will not be considered ubti and therefore will be exempt from federal income tax even if the fund borrows to acquire its investment assets under section b of the code ubti does not include dividends received by a taxexempt entity as a general rule the income tax provisions relating to corporations apply to rics unless subchapter m of the code provides otherwise and thus section b should apply to exclude from ubti dividends paid by a ric to a taxexempt entity this conclusion is also supported by revenue ruling  which applies section b to exclude from ubti dividends paid to the taxexempt stockholders of a real estate investment trust a conduit entity that invests in real estate and is substantially similar to a ric for tax purposes on the same theory if a taxexempt entity however borrows money to purchase its interests in the company a portion of its income from the company will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debtfinanced property” rules of the code   certain organizations that are exempt from taxation under the code are subject to different rules for example a charitable remainder trust as defined in section  of the code that realizes ubti during a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to  of such income each investor that is a taxexempt entity is urged to consult with its own tax advisers regarding the us federal state local nonus income and other tax treatment of its investment in the fund based upon its particular circumstances   certain considerations for nonus investors absent a specific statutory exemption dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the fund to a stockholder that is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code a “foreign stockholder” are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate even if they are funded by income or gains such as portfolio interest shortterm capital gains or foreignsource dividend and interest income that if paid to a foreign stockholder directly would not be subject to withholding distributions properly reported as capital gain dividends generally are not subject to withholding of us federal income tax   for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning before january   the fund was not required to withhold any amounts i with respect to distributions from ussource interest income of types similar to those not subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign stockholder to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the fund in a written notice to stockholders “interestrelated dividends” and ii with respect to distributions of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the fund in a written notice to stockholders “shortterm capital gain dividends” this exception to withholding for interestrelated dividends did not apply to distributions to a foreign stockholder a that had  not provided a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner was  not a us person b to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign stockholder was the issuer or was a  stockholder of the issuer c that was within certain foreign countries that had inadequate information exchange with the united states or d to the extent the dividend was attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign stockholder and the foreign stockholder was a controlled foreign corporation the exception to withholding for shortterm capital gain dividends did not apply to a distributions to an individual foreign stockholder who was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the distribution and b distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of us real property interests as described below the fund was permitted to report such part of its dividends as interestrelated andor shortterm capital gain dividends as were eligible but was not required to do so in the case of shares held through an intermediary the intermediary may withhold even if the fund reports all or a portion of a payment as an interestrelated or shortterm capital gain dividend to stockholders  this exemption from withholding for interestrelated and shortterm capital gain dividends has expired for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning on or after january   therefore the fund or intermediary as applicable is currently required to withhold on distributions to foreign stockholders attributable to net interest or shortterm capital gains that were formerly eligible for this withholding exemption it is currently unclear whether congress will extend this exemption from withholding for interestrelated and shortterm capital gain dividends for distributions with respect to taxable years of the fund beginning on or after january   and what the terms of such an extension would be including whether such extension would have retroactive effect   foreign stockholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts   a foreign stockholder is not in general subject to us federal income tax on gains and is not allowed a deduction for losses realized on the sale of shares of the fund or on capital gain dividends unless i such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign stockholder of a trade or business within the united states ii in the case of a foreign stockholder that is an individual the stockholder is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met or iii the special rules relating to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of “us real property interests” “usrpis” apply to the foreign stockholder’s sale of shares of the fund or to the capital gain dividend the foreign stockholder received as described below   foreign stockholders with respect to whom income from the fund is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the foreign stockholder within the united states will in general be subject to us federal income tax on the income derived from the fund at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens residents or domestic corporations whether such income is received in cash or reinvested in shares of the fund and in the case of a foreign corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax if a foreign stockholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the stockholder in the united states more generally foreign stockholders who are residents in a country with an income tax treaty with the united states may obtain different tax results than those described herein and are urged to consult their tax advisors   special rules would apply if the fund were either a “us real property holding corporation” “usrphc” or would be a usrphc but for the operation of certain exceptions to the definition thereof very generally a usrphc is a domestic corporation that holds usrpis the fair market value of which equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s usrpis interests in real property located outside the united states and other trade or business assets usrpis are generally defined as any interest in us real property and any interest other than solely as a creditor in a usrphc or very generally an entity that has been a usrphc in the last five years if an interest in the fund were a usrpi a greaterthan foreign stockholder generally would be required to file a us tax return in connection with the sale of its fund shares and pay related taxes due on any gain realized on the sale  if the fund were a usrphc or would be a usrphc but for the exceptions referred to above under a special “lookthrough” rule any distributions by the fund to a foreign stockholder attributable directly or indirectly to distributions received by the fund from a lowertier reit that the fund is required to treat as usrpi gain in its hands generally would be subject to us tax withholding in addition such distributions could result in the foreign stockholder being required to file a us tax return and pay tax on the distributions at regular us federal income tax rates the consequences to a foreign stockholder including the rate of such withholding and character of such distributions eg as ordinary income or usrpi gain would vary depending upon the extent of the foreign stockholder’s current and past ownership of the fund prior to january   the special “lookthrough” rule described above for distributions by the fund to foreign stockholders also applied to distributions attributable to i gains realized on the disposition of usrpis by the fund and ii distributions received by the fund from a lowertier ric that the fund was required to treat as usrpi gain in its hands it is currently unclear whether congress will extend these former “lookthrough” provisions to distributions made on or after january   and what the terms of any such extension would be including whether any such extension would have retroactive effect   foreign stockholders should consult their tax advisers and if holding shares through intermediaries their intermediaries concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the fund   provisions of fatca the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” generally requires the fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its stockholders under fatca as described more fully below if a stockholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with fatca the fund may be required to withhold under fatca at a rate of  with respect to that stockholder on dividends including capital gain distributions and the proceeds of the sale redemption or exchange of fund shares if a payment by the fund is subject to fatca withholding the fund is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign stockholders described above eg capital gain distributions and shortterm capital gain and interestrelated dividends beginning as early as july     payments to a stockholder will generally not be subject to fatca withholding provided the stockholder provides the fund with such certifications waivers or other documentation or information as the fund requires including to the extent required with regard to such stockholder’s direct and indirect owners to establish the stockholder’s fatca status and otherwise to comply with these rules in order to avoid withholding a stockholder that is a “foreign financial institution” “ffi” must either i become a “participating ffi” by entering into a valid us tax compliance agreement with the irs ii qualify for an exception from the requirement to enter into such an agreement for example by becoming a “deemed compliant ffi” or iii be covered by an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the united states and a nonus government to implement fatca and improve international tax compliance in any of these cases the investing ffi generally will be required to provide the fund with appropriate identifiers certifications or documentation concerning its status   the fund will disclose the information that it receives from or concerning its stockholders to the irs nonus taxing authorities or other parties as necessary to comply with fatca related intergovernmental agreements or other applicable law or regulation   each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of fatca and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective investor’s own situation including investments through an intermediary  employees   the fund expects to have no employees and will rely on the investment manager and its officers all of whom are employed and paid by the investment manager to administer its affairs subject to the supervision of the fund’s board of directors   d  financial information about geographic areas   not applicable the fund has not yet commenced business   item a risk factors   lack of operating history the fund will begin operations upon the initial closing and has no operating history with which to evaluate its future performance   risks associated with investing in smaller and lower middle market companies the fund is expected to invest primarily in mezzanine unitranche and second lien loans in privatelyheld companies with ebitda between approximately  million and  million companies of this size typically have weaker financial and human resources than larger companies have less extensive research and development manufacturing marketing andor service capabilities and may be susceptible to competition from larger and better capitalized companies smaller companies often depend upon the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals and the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a significant impact on the investment returns from a particular company also smaller companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger companies and may not have as great an ability to raise additional capital smaller companies may have a shorter history of operations as compared to larger companies which could make it more difficult for the fund to evaluate their future performance there is often less publicly available information about smaller companies than larger companies they are thus generally less liquid and more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results   although the fund will seek to mitigate these risks through diversification and conservative deal terms covenants monitoring board observation rights etc it must be anticipated that a one or more of the fund’s investments collectively “portfolio investments” may be unprofitable over the fund’s investment life and c the fund will incur losses on some of the portfolio investments   leverage borrowings to finance the acquisition of portfolio investments may occur at the fund level or the portfolio company level if any or all directly incur leverage in connection with a portfolio investment or an investment by a portfolio company as applicable the leverage used by the fund may take the form of indebtedness for borrowed money as well as financial leverage in the form of options and other similar transactions any borrowings of the fund will be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the  act see the discussion at item  under the caption “regulation”   leverage may have important adverse consequences to the fund and its portfolio companies the amount borrowed in connection with an investment and the interest rates on those borrowings which may fluctuate from time to time as well as the fees and other costs of borrowing may have a marked effect on such investment’s performance the borrower may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants leverage also may impair the borrowers’ ability to finance their future operations and capital needs as a result their flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to business opportunities may be limited a leveraged investment’s income and net assets will tend to fluctuate at a greater rate than if leverage were not used in addition if an investment has a leveraged capital structure it will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors such as a significant rise in interest rates a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in the condition of the borrower or its industry furthermore a borrower that has secured its leverage through the pledging of collateral may if such borrower is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on its indebtedness be subject to risk that a lender seizes its assets through margin calls or otherwise  the fund and the sbic subsidiary if one is formed will each pay a management fee the “investment management fee” to the investment manager the investment management fee base will include the cost basis of portfolio investments acquired with borrowed funds  this effectively increases the cost of the fund’s and the sbic subsidiary’s if applicable borrowings by the incremental investment management fee   if the fund borrows at variable rates without hedging to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations and makes the bulk of its loans at fixed rates an increase in prevailing interest rates would narrow the spread between the fund’s cost of capital and its investment return to the detriment of the fund’s performance in addition because the terms of the fund’s borrowing facilities are set for relatively long periods of time reductions in the returns available from the fund’s investments due to changes in prevailing rates could make the use of leverage unattractive unless the terms of the borrowing facility were renegotiated   risks associated with loans the fund will invest primarily in senior secured and unsecured loans the fund generally will make the loan directly although occasionally loans may be originated and syndicated by banks or other financial institutions or acquired in the secondary market loans generally will not be readily marketable and will be subject to restrictions on resale in some cases negotiations involved in disposing of indebtedness may require weeks to complete consequently some indebtedness may be difficult or impossible to dispose of readily at what the investment manager believes to be a fair price in addition loans are often less liquid than other types of debt securities particularly in times of significant market dislocation   lenders depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the corporate or other borrower for payment of principal and interest if the fund does not receive scheduled interest or principal payments on such indebtedness the value of the portfolio investments would be adversely affected the fund may invest in secured and unsecured loans loans that are fully secured may offer the fund more protection than an unsecured loan in the event of nonpayment of scheduled interest or principal however there is no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral from a secured loan would satisfy the borrower’s obligation or that such collateral could be liquidated in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower the fund could experience delays or limitations in its ability to realize the benefits of any collateral securing a loan   loans may permit or require in addition to scheduled payments of interest and principal the prepayment of the loan from free cash flow the degree to which borrowers prepay loans whether as a contractual requirement or at their election may be affected by prevailing interest rates general business conditions the financial condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among lenders among others as such prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy upon a prepayment either in part or in full the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced the effect of prepayments on the fund’s performance may or may not be mitigated by the receipt of prepayment fees andor the fund’s reinvestment of prepayments in other loans that have comparable yields see “credit risk” below  credit risk the fund is subject to credit risk ie the risk that an issuer or borrower will default in the payment of principal andor interest on an instrument credit risk also includes the risk that a counterparty to a derivatives instrument eg a swap counterparty will be unwilling or unable to meet its obligations financial strength and solvency of an issuer or borrower are the primary factors influencing credit risk degree of subordination lack or inadequacy of collateral or credit enhancement for a debt instrument may affect the fund’s credit risk there are no restrictions on the credit quality of the portfolio investments securities in which the fund may invest generally will not have been rated by any rating agency with the result that the investment manager must rely on its own evaluation of the financial strength of the borrower without the benefit of rating agency research   subordination of investments portfolio investments may be in subordinated loans structurally subordinated loans mezzanine loans and other structured investments and preferred equity interests or equity interests of an issuer these portfolio investments will be subordinated to the senior obligations of the property or issuer either contractually structurally or inherently due to the nature of the securities greater credit risks are usually attached to these subordinated investments than to investments in senior obligations in addition these securities may not be protected by financial or other covenants such as limitations upon additional indebtedness typically protecting the senior debt and may have limited liquidity adverse changes in the borrower’s financial condition andor in general economic conditions may impair the ability of the borrower to make payments on the subordinated securities and cause it to default more quickly with respect to such securities than with respect to the borrower’s senior obligations holders of subordinated securities are generally not entitled to receive any payments in bankruptcy or liquidation until senior creditors are paid in full in addition in many cases the fund’s management of its investment and its remedies with respect thereto including the ability to foreclose on any collateral securing such investment will be limited by restrictions benefiting more senior lenders and contractual intercreditor provisions   interest rate risk “interest rate risk” refers to the risks associated with market changes in interest rates in general rising interest rates will negatively impact the price of fixed rate debt instruments and falling interest rates will have a positive effect on the price of fixed rate debt instruments the prices of long term debt obligations generally fluctuate more than prices of short term debt obligations as interest rates change to the extent the fund invests primarily in longer term debt obligations the fund will be impacted to a greater degree by changes in market interest rates than if the fund invested primarily in short term debt securities even in the case of debt investments that are guar­anteed or insured in whole or in part such guarantees and insurance do not protect the fund from declines in market value caused by changes in interest rates however to the extent that the fund holds a loan to maturity as will generally be the case interim changes in the value of the loan due to interest rate fluctuations will not affect the fund’s ultimate return on the investment provided interest and principal are paid in a timely fashion   increasing interest rates may also increase the amount of interest owed with respect to different types of financing the fund may enter into in order to finance its investments and may create or exacerbate financial stress on the fund’s borrowers   declining interest rates also can adversely affect the fund’s overall performance because the fund may be forced to redeploy principal and interest payments from existing investments into loweryielding investments this “reinvestment risk” can be exacerbated to the extent borrowers can prepay their loans without significant penalties particularly because such prepayments tend to increase as interest rates decline   although variable or floating rate investments allow the fund to participate in increases in interest rates through upward adjustments of the coupon rates on such investments during periods of increasing interest rates changes in the coupon rates may lag behind the change in market rates or may have limits on the maximum increase in coupon rates alternatively during periods of declining interest rates the coupon rates on such investments readjust downward resulting in a lower yield further while increases in interest rates are generally beneficial with respect to instruments owned by the fund such increases may also be detrimental to the investment itself and therefore to the fund depending on the investments owned particularly if such investment is subordinated to more senior loans interest rate sensitivity is generally more pronounced and less predictable in instruments with uncertain payment or prepayment schedules declines in market value if not offset by any corresponding gains on hedging instruments if any may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to the fund  bridge financings the fund may provide interim debt or interim equity financing to an existing or prospective portfolio company in anticipation of permanent financing including an investment by the fund these bridge loans will typically be convertible into a term loan or permanent equity investment in the portfolio company however for reasons not always in the investment manager’s control the anticipated long term securities issuance or other refinancing or syndication may not occur and the bridge loan may remain outstanding in such event the interest rate on such bridge loan may not adequately reflect the risk associated with the unsecured position taken by the fund   paymentinkind securities paymentinkind securities “piks” are debt obligations that pay “interest” in the form of other debt obligations instead of in cash because piks allow an issuer to avoid or delay the need to generate cash to meet current interest payments such securities may involve greater credit risk than bonds that pay interest currently or in cash   warrants and rights the fund may obtain and hold warrants to purchase equity securities warrants do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle their holder to purchase and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer as a result warrants may be considered more speculative than certain other types of investments in addition the market value of a warrant does not necessarily change with the market value of the underlying securities and a warrant ceases to have market value if it is not exercised prior to its expiration date furthermore the terms of warrants or rights may limit the fund’s ability to exercise the warrants or rights at such time or in such quantities as the fund would otherwise desire   additional risks associated with portfolio investments the proceeds from the issuance of the shares and the lp contributions are intended to be invested directly or indirectly in portfolio investments none of which as of the date of this registration statement have been selected by the investment manager in some cases the fund will make investments as part of an investment group with one or more other investment funds or with their sponsors while in others the fund may independently invest in a financing opportunity alongside another investment fund as part of a joint venture or alone when the fund invests as part of an investment group alongside another investment fund or a joint venture partner the fund will typically be required to rely on the sponsor of the other investment fund or its joint venture partner to make decisions regarding the investment and accordingly the value of the portfolio investment could be adversely affected if the interests of the fund diverge from those of the sponsor its joint venture partner or the investment group when the fund invests independently it may not have the same level of governance rights and other protections it would enjoy as part of a larger group furthermore with respect to independentlysourced portfolio investments the investment manager may have to rely solely on its own research and analysis   historical performance not a guarantee of future results the fund’s investment performance may be better or worse than that of other investment funds managed by the investment manager in particular the debt and mezzanine financing markets have historically been cyclical and debt and mezzanine financing market conditions during the fund’s investment period may differ from those that prevailed during the investment periods for other investment funds managed by the investment manager it is impossible to predict the precise conditions in the debt and mezzanine financing and private equity markets in the future in addition even though previous activities and investments of other funds managed by the investment manager have been subject to similar risk factors discussed herein the fund may not be able to duplicate any previous success in avoiding certain deleterious effects from the risks involved  illiquidity of shares an investment in the fund is intended for longterm investors who can accept the risks associated with making speculative primarily illiquid investments in privately negotiated transactions the shares will not be registered under the  act or the securities laws of the various states or other jurisdictions and are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer there will be no trading market for shares and stockholders are likely to be required to hold their shares until the final liquidation of the fund an investment in the fund is therefore illiquid and should be considered only by investors financially able to maintain their investment for the long term   similarly most portfolio investments are expected to be illiquid when acquired and may be subject to certain transfer restrictions some portfolio investments will not provide any liquidity rights see “illiquidity of the portfolio investments” below even if the fund is able to obtain liquidity rights economic factors such as the inability to dispose of investments at the price desired may limit the fund’s ability to exercise these rights in addition applicable law including the  act may limit the amount of dividends and other distributions payable by the fund and all such dividends and other distributions must be authorized by the board of directors of the fund furthermore since the amount and timing of the fund’s cash distributions to investors is dependent upon the cash flow that the fund receives from the portfolio investments and upon the realization of the portfolio investments and because of the fund’s ability to reinvest proceeds the portfolio investments even if they prove successful are unlikely to produce significant cash flow for investors for a period of years there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to liquidate a particular portfolio investment or distribute securities at the time or upon the terms it desires   illiquidity of the portfolio investments the portfolio investments are expected in general to range from somewhat to extremely illiquid it is possible that the liquidity of a security will decline sharply after its purchase whether because of adverse developments affecting that security or a general withdrawal of capital from the small and lower middle market   general economic market and political conditions the success of the fund’s activities will be affected by general economic and market conditions changes in laws trade barriers currency exchange controls and national and international political circumstances these factors may affect the level and volatility of prices and the liquidity of portfolio investments which could adversely affect the fund’s profitability or result in losses events such as war terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may in the future lead to increased volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on the us and world economies and markets generally   global financial markets have occasionally experienced periods of unprecedented turmoil the debt and equity capital markets in the united states were negatively impacted by significant writeoffs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the repricing of credit risk in the broader market among other things these events along with the deterioration of the housing market the failure of major financial institutions and the concerns that other financial institutions as well as the global financial system were also experiencing severe economic distress materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular these events contributed to severe market volatility and caused severe liquidity strains in the credit markets which in turn severely affected participants in the private equity industry volatile financial markets can expose the fund to greater market and liquidity risk risks to a robust resumption of growth persist albeit to a lesser extent a weak consumer weighed down by too much debt and significant joblessness the growing size of the federal budget deficit and national debt and the threat of inflation  the public securities markets have seen significant volatility and the ability of companies to obtain financing for ongoing operations or expansions may be severely constrained by the tightening of the credit markets and deterioration of the us and global financial market conditions the ability to realize investments depends not only on the underlying portfolio companies and their historical results and prospects but also on political market and economic conditions at the time of realization of such investments the trading market if any for the securities of any portfolio company may not be sufficiently liquid to enable the fund to sell these securities when it believes it is most advantageous to do so or without adversely affecting the stock price  the instability in the financial markets has led the us government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity see “regulatory risks” below federal state and other governments their regulatory agencies or selfregulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the fund is expected to invest or the issuers of such instruments in ways that are unforeseeable   in addition on august   standard  poor’s lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the united states from aaa to aa because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to us government obligations the ultimate impact of the downgrade is unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent however if the other major credit rating agencies issue downgrades or if standard  poor’s issues further downgrades the resulting market response could be extreme and possibly adverse to the portfolio investments   investment selection the success of the fund depends to a great extent upon the investment manager’s ability to identify superior investments while the portfolio investment selection process entails consideration of many subjective factors investors in the fund will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant subjective factors and will be dependent on the judgment and ability of the investment manager in selecting such investments there can be no assurance that the investment manager will fulfill the fund’s objective of investing in portfolio investments that can produce superior returns over the lifetime of the fund   risks regarding dispositions of portfolio investments in connection with the disposition of portfolio investments the fund may be required to make representations and warranties about the business and financial affairs of the issuer typical of those made in connection with the sale of any busi­ness the fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that such representations and warranties turn out to be inaccurate or misleading these arrangements may result in liabilities for the fund although the securities in which the fund is expected to invest generally will not be publicly traded the ability to successfully exit those investments may be negatively impacted by public market conditions   concentrationdiversification standards although the investment manager will seek to diversify the fund’s investment portfolio to the extent possible consistent with the fund’s investment strategy various factors including prevailing market conditions available investment opportunities regulatory constraints constraints imposed by certain portfolio companies and the timing of investments may prevent the investment manager from diversifying the fund’s portfolio or may result in the fund’s portfolio not being as diversified as the investment manager may otherwise prefer the fund will not be “diversified” for purposes of the  act  it is anticipated that commencing with the second year of its investment operations the fund will seek to meet the requirements including diversification requirements to qualify as a ric under the code see the discussion at item l under the caption “taxation” there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to meet those requirements in addition prior to the time if any that the fund qualifies as a ric it will not be subject to such diversification requirements   for these and other reasons the fund could potentially be concentrated in relatively few portfolio investments or types of portfolio investments one risk of having a limited number of portfolio investments is that the aggregate returns realized by the investors may be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of such portfolio investments similarly should the portfolio investments be concentrated in a small number of industries or related industries the risk to the investors would increase because companies in the same industry or related industries are often subject to similar business risks and regulatory burdens and the impact of a single economic political or regulatory occurrence may have a greater adverse impact on the portfolio investments   risks associated with the fund’s sbic subsidiaries the fund may make investments in qualifying small businesses through the sbic subsidiary which will apply to be licensed by the sba to act as an sbic and as a result will be subject to sba regulations  there can be no guarantee that the sba will issue an sbic license to the sbic subsidiary nor can there be any assurance of the timing required to do so if the sbic subsidiary does not receive an sbic license the fund will continue with its investment program without the benefit of sba debentures even if an sbic license is granted there can be no assurance that the sbic subsidiary will obtain access to sbaguaranteed debenture leverage “sba debentures” of the timing to achieve such access or if access is achieved the interest rates and fees that would be imposed because access to sba debentures is subject to satisfaction of sba performance requirements and compliance with applicable regulations under the sbic act  furthermore the amount of sba debenture funding available to sbics is dependent upon annual congressional authorizations and in the future may be subject to annual congressional appropriations there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient sba debenture funding available at the times desired by the sbic subsidiary the sba debentures have a maturity of ten years and require semiannual payments of interest the sbic subsidiary if formed will need to generate sufficient cash flow to make required interest payments on the sba debentures  the interest payments on drawn sba debenture leverage generally have priority over payments to limited partners of an sbic including the fund  covenants and financial tests governing sba debentures may also limit the ability of the sbic subsidiary to make new investments if successfully licensed as an sbic the sbic subsidiary will be subject to sba regulations which are lengthy and complex  furthermore congress may amend or supplement the rules governing sbics in a manner that imposes additional regulatory burdens or otherwise adversely affects an sbic the sba has significant ability to supervise and regulate many critical aspects of the affairs of an sbic  the sba imposes greater restrictions on the portfolio of an sbic than would generally be the case for an unregulated private investment fund  certain activities and decisions require sba approval and there are uncertain timeframes for such approvals  for instance the sba places restrictions on the companies in which an sbic can invest and on certain terms of investments by sbics thereby restricting the companies that the fund can finance and potentially adversely affecting the returns on investments by the fund  compliance with sba regulations and policies including those addressing conflicts of interest may cause an sbic subsidiary of the fund to forego attractive investment opportunities that such sbic subsidiary may otherwise pursue  further the sba regulations require that a licensed sbic be periodically examined and audited by the sba to determine its compliance with the relevant sba regulations and the sba has the power to penalize an sbic in a number of ways  if the sbic subsidiary fails to comply with applicable sbic regulations the sba could depending on the severity of the violation limit or prohibit its use of sba debentures declare outstanding sba debentures immediately due and payable andor limit it from making new investments  in addition the sba can revoke or suspend a license for willful or repeated violation of or willful or repeated failure to observe any provision of the sbic act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder  such actions by the sba would in turn negatively affect the fund  the sbic subsidiary if formed may be limited by the sbic act and sba regulations governing sbics from making certain distributions to the fund that may be necessary to maintain the fund’s status as a ric and avoid a consequent imposition of an entitylevel tax on the fund if this occurred the investment manager could seek to liquidate other fund investments to generate sufficient cash to make the required distributions although there can be no assurance that such liquidations could be accomplished in the required timeframe or on attractive terms the general partner of the partnership as the sole stockholder of the fund is authorized under the partnership’s governing documents to consent to the deemed receipt by the partnership of a cashless “consent dividend” if necessary to enable the fund to maintain its status as a ric the general partner of the partnership might be willing to provide such a consent to avoid the negative consequences to the partnership’s limited partners should the fund lose its ric status there can be no assurance however that the general partner of the partnership will provide such consent the fund could also request a waiver of the sba’s restrictions for its sbic subsidiaries to make the distributions required to maintain the fund’s ric status although the sba does not grant such waivers as a matter of course and there can be no assurance that the sba will grant such waiver   risks associated with control strategies the fund may hold a controlling position in a portfolio investment and may hold board or observer seats on many of its portfolio companies although such positions may be important to the fund’s investment strategy they may subject the fund to claims it would not otherwise be subject to if such controlling position or board or observer seats were not held the fund will generally indemnify the investment manager and its affiliates from such claims which may be costly to defend and could result in substantial liability   the exercise of control over a company may impose for example additional risks of liability for environmental damage product defects failure to supervise management pension and other fringe benefits violation of governmental regulations including securities laws or other types of related liability if these liabilities were to arise the fund may suffer a significant loss in such investment   lack of control of portfolio investments in some cases the fund will not have the right to participate in the daytoday management control or operation of the portfolio investments nor will it have the unilateral right to remove the managers thereof the fund also will not necessarily have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic financial and other information which will be utilized by the managers of its portfolio companies with respect to the operation of such portfolio companies as a result the fund’s ability to protect its position in such asset will be limited in addition these portfolio investments may involve risks in connection with thirdparty management or strategic partners having financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such investment and such third parties may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with those of the fund or may be in a position to take or block action contrary to the fund’s investment objectives in addition the fund may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of such thirdparty management or strategic partners  abundance of capital the investment manager believes that the supply of investments in the small and lower middle market today exceeds the amount of capital committed to these markets this imbalance could be reduced or even reversed in certain markets or submarkets as publicly traded companies including public bdcs private equity funds hedge funds proprietary trading desks and other investors increase their commitments to these markets some of these competing sources of capital might be able to obtain investment capital more readily or on better terms than the fund particularly competitors that have access to the public equity or debt markets increased demand for the securities of small and lower middle market companies could drive up pricing and make investing in the sector less attractive similarly the investment manager may not obtain as favorable terms as it would otherwise in a less competitive environment additionally the fund’s need to comply with provisions of the  act pertaining to bdcs and if the fund qualifies as a ric provisions of the code pertaining to rics may restrict the fund’s flexibility as compared with its competitors the fund and its portfolio companies may incur significant expenses investigating potential investments which are ultimately not consummated including expenses relating to due diligence transportation legal expenses and the fees of other thirdparty advisers   uncertainty of valuation generally there will be no readily available market for all or a substantial number of the portfolio investments and hence most of the portfolio investments will be difficult to value this uncertainty of valuations could both limit the ability of the fund’s investors to gauge the fund’s ongoing performance and the ability of the investment manager to evaluate the past performance of prospective portfolio investments for these and other reasons it will be difficult for an investor to value its interest in the fund   regulatory restrictions the fund is electing to be treated as a bdc under the  act although bdcs are exempt from registration under the  act and are relieved from compliance with some but not all of the provisions of the  act there are greater restrictions in some respects on permitted types of investments for bdcs than there are for unregulated funds these requirements may limit the fund’s investment opportunities moreover the applicable provisions of the  act continue to impose numerous restrictions on the activities of the fund including restrictions on leverage and on the nature of its investments while the fund is not aware of any judicial rulings under and is aware of only a few administrative interpretations of the small business incentive act of  there can be no assurance that such act will be interpreted or administratively implemented in a manner consistent with the fund’s objectives or manner of operation see the discussion at item  under the caption “regulation”   lack of ability to participate investors will have limited rights and powers to participate in the management or control of the business of the fund and thus must depend solely upon the ability of the investment manager with respect to making monitoring and disposing of investments   regulatory risks legal tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the fund that may adversely affect the fund in particular changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretations of the laws and regulations which govern bdcs sbics rics or nondepository commercial lenders could significantly and adversely affect the fund’s operations and cost of doing business  in addition the regulatory environment for private funds is evolving and changes in the regulation of private funds may adversely affect the value of portfolio investments and the ability of the fund and the portfolio investments to obtain the leverage they may otherwise obtain the sec and other regulators and selfregulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies the regulation of private investment funds is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund or the investment manager could be substantial and adverse  additionally certain portfolio investments may be in industries subject to extensive government regulation certain regulations may prevent the fund from making certain investments that it otherwise would make other regulations may require the fund to incur substantial additional costs or lengthy delays in connection with the completion of an investment or substantially reduce the value of the portfolio investments in addition governmental regulation may not be predictable and may be subject to political economic social andor market developments for example the fund may be subject to the regulations of the federal communications commission the “fcc” if the fund invests in an entity that has a direct or indirect interest in owns or controls a “media company” such as a television or radio station cable system or daily newspaper or a company providing wireless communications pursuant to an fcc license “wireless licensee” these restrictions may among other things prohibit certain communications between an investor or such investor’s officers directors partners or other officials and the investment manager pertaining to the operations of the media company and may limit an investor from serving as an agent or employee of the fund these restrictions may also prevent the fund from investing in certain media companies or wireless licensees or require the fund to divest certain media companies or wireless licensees due to fcc restrictions on concentration of ownership of media companies and wireless licensees see also “regulatory restrictions” “risks associated with the fund’s sbic subsidiaries” and “business and regulatory risks of private investment funds”   key personnel the performance of the fund will depend in significant part upon the skill and expertise of the key personnel of the investment manager and the portfolio investments and may be adversely affected by key individuals joining or leaving the investment manager or the portfolio companies’ investment or management teams although the investment manager’s personnel will devote as much time as they believe necessary to assist the fund in achieving its investment objectives only some individuals will devote substantially all of his or her working time to the affairs of the fund the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the fund or a portfolio investment   management fees and expenses the fund bears its management fees and expenses and also indirectly bears the management fees and expenses of the sbic subsidiary if one is formed the investment return on the portfolio investments therefore must be sufficient to offset all levels of fees and expenses before the fund will earn a positive investment return   inkind distribution of illiquid securities the fund may make inkind distributions of portfolio investments all of which may be highly illiquid there can be no assurance that investors in the fund will be able to dispose of these portfolio investments or will not incur significant costs and expenses in connection with any such disposition or that the value of these portfolio investments as determined by the investment manager in connection with the determination of distributions will ultimately be realized   business and regulatory risks of private investment funds the financial markets are extensively regulated and subject to frequent regulatory change legal tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the fund that may adversely affect the fund new laws or revised regulations imposed by the sec the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the federal reserve and other us and nonus governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets that could adversely affect the fund may be adopted in the future the fund may also be adversely affected by changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing statutes and rules by these governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations the regulatory environment for private investment funds is evolving and changes in the regulation or taxation of private investment funds may adversely affect the value of portfolio investments andor the ability of the fund and its portfolio companies to obtain leverage or otherwise execute their investment or operating strategies in addition the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements the sec cftc and other us and nonus regulators and selfregulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of financial market emergencies the regulation of derivatives transactions and funds that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund could be substantial and adverse  tax status the fund must meet a number of requirements described in item  under the caption “taxation” to qualify for the passthrough status as a ric and if qualified to continue to so qualify if the fund experiences difficulty in meeting the diversification requirement for any fiscal quarter of its taxable year it may accelerate capital calls or if available borrowings in order to increase the portion of the fund’s total assets represented by cash cash items and us government securities as of the close of the following fiscal quarter and thus attempt to meet the diversification requirement the fund however would incur additional interest and other expenses in connection with any such accelerated borrowings and increased investments by the fund in cash cash items and us government securities whether the funds to make such investments are derived from called equity capital or from accelerated borrowings are likely to reduce the fund’s return furthermore there can be no assurance that the fund would be able to meet the diversification requirements through such actions failure to qualify as a ric would deny the fund passthrough status and in a year in which the fund has taxable income would have a significant adverse effect on the returns of the fund   when the fund elects to convert its status from that of an ordinary or c corporation to that of a ric it must choose either to i pay tax whenever an asset is sold during the subsequent “conversion period” generally ten years following the conversion on the amount of gain which would have been realized had the asset been sold on the conversion date or ii treat the entire amount of “builtin gain” as income at the time of conversion   accelerated transactions for the fund to take advantage of available investment opportunities the investment manager may need to make investment decisions on an expedited basis in such cases the information available to the investment manager at the time of an investment decision may be limited the investment manager may not therefore have access to the detailed information necessary for a full analysis and evaluation of the investment opportunity   followon investments following its initial investment in a portfolio investment the fund may have the opportunity to increase its investment in such portfolio investment there is no assurance that the fund will make followon investments or that the fund will have sufficient resources to or be permitted to make such investments any decision not to make followon investments or the fund’s inability to make them may have a substantial negative impact on such portfolio investment in need of such an additional investment may result in missed opportunities for the fund or may result in dilution of the fund’s investment in certain cases the  act may impose restrictions on the fund’s ability to make followon investments even when such an investment would be beneficial to the fund   counterparty risk the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts and other instruments entered into directly or indirectly by it the fund will also be subject to the risk that a counterparty to a trade may become unwilling or unable to meet its obligations prior to settlement this risk may be more acute with respect to fixed income securities because the settle­ment periods for such securities are often longer than for equity securities if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances   in situations where the fund is required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty the counterparty may fail to segregate the collateral or may commingle the collateral with the counterparty’s own assets as a result in the event of the counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency the fund’s collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the counterparty’s creditors and the fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating it as a general unsecured creditor of the counterparty rather than as the owner of the collateral  the fund may effect certain transactions in “overthecounter” or “interdealer” markets the participants in such markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of “exchange based” markets the fund is likely to be treated as an unsecured creditor of any “overthecounter” derivative counterparty in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency both with respect to the amounts owed by the counterparty under the derivatives transaction and with respect to any collateral that has been transferred to such counterparty the credit risk arising from futures and cleared derivatives is generally different from the credit risk arising from “overthecounter” derivatives because a party to a futures contract or a cleared derivatives transaction is generally subject to the credit risk of the clearing house and the futures commission merchant or clearing member through which it holds its cleared position rather than the credit risk of a market “counterparty” the fund generally may only close out “overthecounter” transactions including swaps and contracts for differences with the relevant counterparty and may only transfer a position with the consent of the particular counterparty also if the counterparty defaults the fund will have contractual remedies but there is no assurance that the counterparty will be able to meet its contractual obligations or that in the event of default the fund will succeed in enforcing them   securities markets risk the value of portfolio investments could be affected by factors affecting the securities markets generally such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions supply and demand for particular instruments changes in the general outlook for the securities market or corporate earnings interest rates announcements of political information or adverse investor sentiment generally the market values of portfolio investments may decline for a number of reasons including increases in defaults resulting from overall economic conditions increases in prepayments resulting from increased borrower mobility or the availability of “cashout” refinancing opportunities or widening of credit spreads unfavorable securities markets conditions may also increase the fund’s costs limit its access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the fund or a portfolio investment   inflationdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from portfolio investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates as inflation increases the real value of portfolio investments could decline and the interest payments on any related borrowings may increase deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers increase the real value of debts owed and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the portfolio investments   risks of litigation the fund’s investment activities may include activities that are hostile in nature and will subject it to the risks of becoming involved in litigation with third parties this risk may be greater where the fund exercises control or significant influence over a portfolio investment the fund may have indemnification obligations in connection with any such litigation in particular the fund may be obligated to indemnify the investment manager its affiliates members employees and agents and each director and officer of the fund   satisfaction of liabilities of the fund it is anticipated that the assets of the fund including any portfolio investments will be available to satisfy the liabilities and other obligations of the fund if the fund becomes subject to a liability parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the fund’s assets generally and not be limited to any particular assets such as the asset representing the portfolio investment giving rise to the liability this may result in the fund disposing of assets it holds in order to satisfy liabilities arising from other assets which could have a material adverse effect on the fund  cyclical nature of debt markets from time to time the market for private equitydebt transactions has been adversely affected by a decrease in the availability of senior and subordinated financing for transactions sometimes in response to regulatory pressures on providers of financing to reduce or eliminate their exposure to such transactions a general downturn in the debt markets can create a situation in which portfolio investments suffer rising default rates such rising default rates may further tighten the lending environment leading to a cycle of default and increasing interest rates the inability of portfolio companies to secure debt financing at reasonable interest rates may adversely affect their profitability and financial stability and will subject such portfolio companies to increased exposure to adverse economic factors such as a significant rise in interest rates a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in the condition of that portfolio company   the debt markets have from time to time experienced a significant lack of liquidity this lack of liquidity creates a number of risks there can be no assurance that the market will in the future become more liquid and it may well continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future it is also possible that illiquidity in the debt markets could cause prices to decline further which may have the result of forcing portfolio companies or other leveraged investment vehicles to sell assets to satisfy requirements under their borrowing arrangements or to meet margin calls which could in turn create further downward price pressure   foreign investing portfolio investments may be subject to changing political environments regulatory restrictions and changes in government institutions and policies any of which could adversely affect their value the fund does not intend to obtain political risk insurance as a bdc the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in securities of companies which are not “eligible portfolio companies” an “eligible portfolio company” must be organized under the laws of and have its principal place of business in the united states see the discussion at item  under the caption “regulation”  therefore the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in nonus companies to the extent that the fund invests in nonus assets and securities actions by the governments of foreign countries could have a significant effect on the economies of various countries which could adversely affect market conditions as well as prices and if applicable yields and the cost and availability of leverage political and economic instability in any of the foreign countries in which the fund invests could adversely affect the fund while the developed economies and many emerging economies have achieved relatively stable political economic and social structures it is possible that conditions could change materially during the lifetime of the fund investments in developing economies or emerging markets may be more subject than those in developed markets to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases also nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation currency blockage market disruption political changes security suspensions or diplomatic developments could adversely affect investments in foreign economies particularly emerging market countries   although developed countries generally recognize basic commercial relationships and rights some still lack the extensive body of law and practice normally encountered in western business environments laws and regulations in developing market countries affecting western business and investment particularly those involving taxation foreign investment and trade can change quickly and unpredictably in a more volatile manner than in the united states or other developed market economies additionally attempts at judicial enforcement of existing laws judgments or arbitral awards may encounter significant delay and difficulty and courts may not be totally impartial in adjudicating disputes between foreigners and local persons or companies in addition although substantial revisions have been made to the commercial law of some of the countries in which the fund may invest the judicial and civil procedures often have not been modernized to nearly the same extent as a result not only do courts lack experience in commercial dispute resolution but many of the procedural remedies for enforcement and protection of legal rights typically found in western jurisdictions are less available in particular the bankruptcy or receivership process in countries outside the united states may be less transparent or provide less protection to creditors than is the case in the united states  because nonus entities are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to us companies there may be different types of and lowerquality information available about companies in foreign markets than is the case for companies in the us this reduced transparency may make it more difficult to select and manage investments and makes the valuation of the securities of companies less reliable   changes in any jurisdiction’s policy with regard to taxation fiscal and monetary policies repatriation of profits and other economic regulations are possible any of which may have an adverse effect on investments in such jurisdiction any such changes may adversely affect the value of portfolio investments the economies of the foreign countries in which the fund makes investments may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy with regard to the rate of growth of gross domestic product the rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments   restrictions on repatriation of capital and profits some countries in which the fund may invest control in varying degrees the repatriation of capital and profits that result from foreign investment capital markets often opaque continue to be highly regulated and will likely be subject to continuing government restrictions there can be no assurance that the fund will be permitted to repatriate capital or profits if any from these countries   eurorelated risk the recent global economic crisis brought several small economies in europe to the brink of bankruptcy and many other economies into recession and weakened the banking and financial sectors of many european countries for example the governments of greece spain portugal and the republic of ireland have all recently experienced large public budget deficits the effects of which are still yet unknown and may slow the overall recovery of the european economies from the recent global economic crisis in addition due to large public deficits some european countries may be dependent on assistance from other european governments and institutions or multilateral agencies and offices assistance may be dependent on a country’s implementation of reforms or reaching a certain level of performance failure to reach those objectives or an insufficient level of assistance could result in a deep economic downturn which could significantly affect the value of european portfolio investments   the economic and monetary union of the european union “emu” is comprised of the european union members that have adopted the euro currency by adopting the euro as its currency a member state relinquishes control of its own monetary policies as a result european countries are significantly affected by fiscal and monetary controls implemented by the emu the euro currency may not fully reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the various economies that comprise the emu and europe generally   it is possible that emu member countries could abandon the euro and return to a national currency andor that the euro will cease to exist as a single currency in its current form the effects of such an abandonment or a country’s forced expulsion from the euro on that country the rest of the emu and global markets are impossible to predict but are likely to be negative the exit of any country out of the euro would likely have an extremely destabilizing effect on all eurozone countries and their economies and a negative effect on the global economy as a whole in addition under these circumstances it may be difficult to value investments denominated in euros or in a replacement currency  currency risk a portion of the portfolio investments may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly the value of such portfolio investments and the cash flow generated therefrom may decline due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between us dollars and such other currencies because such portfolio investments may require the fund to transact business in nonus dollar currencies during the completion of its investment program the fund may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency rates and in exchange control regulations and may incur transaction costs in connection with conversions between various currencies lender liability considerations and equitable subordination in recent years a number of judicial decisions in the united states have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender has violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or the borrower’s assets resulting in creation of a duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or interest holders in addition courts have in some cases applied the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim of a lending institution against a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when the lending institution or its assignor or predecessor in interest is found to have engaged in unfair inequitable or fraudulent conduct because of the nature of certain of the portfolio investments the fund could be subject to allegations of lender liability or to claims that such investments should be equitably subordinated   fraudulent conveyance and preference considerations various federal and state laws enacted for the protection of creditors may apply to the purchase of portfolio investments by virtue of the fund’s role as a creditor with respect to the borrowers under such investments or as a holder of equity interests in such borrowers if a court in a lawsuit brought by an unpaid creditor or representative of creditors of a borrower were to find that the borrower did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness evidenced by an investment and the grant of any security interest or other lien securing such investment such court could under certain circumstances invalidate in whole or in part such indebtedness and such security interest or other lien as fraudulent conveyances could subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of the borrower or could allow the borrower to recover amounts previously paid by the borrower to the creditor including to the fund in satisfaction of such indebtedness or the proceeds of such security interest or other lien previously applied in satisfaction of such indebtedness in addition in the event of the insolvency of an issuer of an investment payments made with respect to the portfolio investment could be subject to avoidance as a “preference” if made within a certain period of time which may be as long as one year before insolvency depending on a number of factors and such payments can be recaptured either from the initial recipient such as the fund or from subsequent transferees of such payments including limited partners   the investment manager does not intend to cause the fund to engage in conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon fraudulent conveyance preference or equitable subordination there can be no assurance however as to whether any portfolio company or lending institution or other party from which the fund may acquire such indebtedness engaged in any such conduct or any other conduct that would subject such indebtedness and the fund to insolvency laws and if it did as to whether such creditor claims could be asserted in a us court or in the courts of any other country against the fund   indebtedness consisting of obligations of nonus issuers may be subject to various laws enacted in the countries of their issuance for the protection of creditors these insolvency considerations and the levels of protection provided will differ depending on the country in which each issuer is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the issuer is a nonsovereign or a sovereign entity  uncertainties associated with the bankruptcy process issuers of the portfolio investments may file for bankruptcy bankruptcy proceedings generally are contested and adversarial and unanticipated adverse developments can occur that are often beyond the control of the creditors or the debtor while creditors generally are afforded an opportunity to object to significant actions there can be no assurance that a bankruptcy court would not approve actions that may be contrary to the interests of the fund these include the risks that one or more classes of securities could be deemed to have priority over the fund’s interest undue delays or expenses in resolving the bankruptcy use of the cash flow by the debtor during the bankruptcy process in a way that is adverse to its creditors and the possibility that to facilitate emergence from bankruptcy it may be necessary to provide some level of recovery to one or more classes of securities beyond what these classes are entitled to from a strict economic standpoint moreover the duration of a bankruptcy case can only be roughly estimated in some cases the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings can adversely affect a company’s business particularly if customers suppliers and employees lose confidence in the company’s viability as a going concern if a company in bankruptcy is forced to dispose of assets particularly in a chapter  liquidation proceeding the value realized on the disposition of those assets may be less than if the assets were disposed of outside the bankruptcy context   during the bankruptcy an automatic stay will prevent all creditors from taking action against the debtor to collect on amounts owed to such creditors unless a creditor’s claim in such case is secured by assets having a value in excess of such claim no interest will be permitted to accrue and therefore the creditor’s return on investment can be adversely affected by the passage of time during which the plan of reorganization of the debtor is being negotiated approved by the creditors and confirmed by the bankruptcy court   notwithstanding special purpose entities created to hold assets and to structure for bankruptcy remoteness such entities may in certain cases be consolidated in bankruptcy proceedings which can affect the outcome of such proceedings and the amounts ultimately received by creditors   the administrative costs in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and will generally be paid out of the debtor’s estate prior to any return to creditors other than out of assets or proceeds thereof which are subject to valid and enforceable liens and other security interests and equity holders in addition certain claims that have priority by law over the claims of certain creditors for example claims for taxes may be quite high   us bankruptcy law permits the classification of “substantially similar” claims in determining the classification of claims in a reorganization for purpose of voting on a plan of reorganization because the standard for classification is vague there exists a significant risk that the fund’s influence with respect to a class of securities can be lost by the inflation of the number and the amount of claims in or other gerrymandering of the class   claims in bankruptcy cases are often paid at less than par and depending on the debtor’s assets and liabilities there may be no recovery at all for some classes of creditors the claims of secured creditors are often paid out over time initially only the debtor may file and prosecute a plan of reorganization while the us bankruptcy code permits other partiesininterest to file and prosecute a plan of reorganization after the debtors’ “exclusive period” to do so ends bankruptcy courts often extend the debtor’s exclusive period which effectively permits only the debtor to file or prosecute a reorganization plan while creditors can vote on the plan of reorganization the unanimous consent of all creditor classes is not necessarily required for the bankruptcy court to confirm the plan therefore a plan can subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code be “crammed down” on dissenting classes of creditors   some of the portfolio investments may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws of nonus jurisdictions these laws may be substantially less favorable to creditors than or otherwise significantly different from us bankruptcy and insolvency laws  use of derivatives the fund may but is not required to use derivatives to seek to hedge the fund’s exposure to changes in value of one or more portfolio investments including hedging interest rate and currency risk to the extent the fund elects to engage in these transactions it will incur additional costs and there can be no assurance that any particular derivatives transaction will achieve its intended purpose or that suitable derivatives transactions will be available many derivative instruments are inherently leveraged and will expose the fund to the risks of leverage discussed elsewhere   unanticipated movements in markets may result in a poorer overall performance for the fund than if the fund had not engaged in any derivatives transaction in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a derivatives strategy and price movements in the underlying reference instrument eg securities of the portfolio investment being hedged may vary moreover for a variety of reasons the fund may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such derivatives instruments and the underlying reference instrument such imperfect correlation may prevent the fund from achieving the intended result or expose the fund to risk of loss finally the fund may simply not anticipate the occurrence of a particular risk or may deem the probability of such occurrence too low or the cost of hedging too high to warrant establishing a hedging position engaging in derivative transactions will also expose the fund to the risk that a counterparty will be unwilling or unable to meet its obligations and to the risks related to the relatively untested nature of the markets for certain derivative instruments see “counterparty risk” above   certain derivatives transactions used by the fund including certain interest rate swaps and certain credit default index swaps will be required to be centrally cleared in a cleared derivatives transaction the fund’s counterparty to the transaction is a central derivatives clearing organization or clearing house rather than a bank or broker since the fund is not a member of a clearing house and only members of a clearing house “clearing members” can participate directly in the clearing house the fund will hold cleared derivatives transactions through accounts at clearing members who are futures commission merchants who are members of the clearing houses the fund will make and receive payments owed under cleared derivatives transactions including margin payments through the fund’s accounts at clearing members such clearing members guarantee the fund’s performance of its obligations to the clearing house in contrast to bilateral derivatives transactions following a period of advance notice to the fund clearing members can generally require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time and increase the amount of margin required to be provided by the fund to the clearing member for any cleared derivatives transaction above the amount of margin that was required at the beginning of the transaction also the fund is subject to execution risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared or which the investment manager expects to be cleared and no clearing member is willing to clear the transaction on the fund’s behalf in that case the transaction may have to be terminated and the fund could lose some or all of the benefit of any increase in the value of the transaction after the time of the trade and will not be able to maintain the desired transaction   derivatives are also subject to a number of other risks described herein such as interest rate risk liquidity risk management risk and the risk of mispricing or improper or subjective valuation   the foregoing list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the fund no assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred  conflicts of interest   description of small buyout portfolios the investment manager serves as investment manager and affiliates of the investment manager serve as general partner to siguler guff small buyout opportunities fund lp siguler guff small buyout opportunities fund ii lp and their parallel funds the “sbof funds” the investment manager and its affiliates also serve as investment manager andor general partner to certain separate accounts with investment strategies that in whole or in part overlap with those of the sbof funds the sbof funds and such separate accounts are referred to collectively as the “small buyout portfolios” the small buyout portfolios invest in investment funds managed by other managers the “underlying funds” that acquire equity and equityrelated investments in lowermiddle market companies with characteristics similar to those of the companies to which the fund will make loans and equity investments the small buyout portfolios also invest a specified portion of their assets directly in equity and equityrelated investments in lowermiddle market companies typically as a “coinvestment” made alongside an investment by an underlying fund or potential underlying fund into some of the same portfolio companies investments by the small buyout portfolios into underlying funds are referred to as “fund investments” and investments by the small buyout portfolios directly into lowermiddle market companies are referred to as “direct investments” as of december   the small buyout portfolios had an aggregate investment capital of  billion of which  million had not yet been deployed the investment manager or its affiliates may manage additional entities in the future which would be considered small buyout portfolios   in general the small buyout portfolios invest in underlying funds as limited partners and as such do not have the power to direct the daytoday management of the underlying funds including selection of investments and management of portfolio companies in which the underlying funds invest in many cases however the small buyout portfolios are relatively large investors in the underlying funds which give rise to limited governance rights such as seats on advisory boards furthermore when the small buyout portfolios are among the largest investors in an underlying fund the investment manager may be able to influence the actions of the underlying fund’s general partner because the general partner appreciates the large investment and hopes that the small buyout portfolios will continue to invest in the general partner’s subsequent investment vehicles in certain cases the investment manager may obtain specific governance rights with respect to an underlying fund or its related entities such as the right to veto investments proposed to be made by the general partner   potential conflicts involving the small buyout portfolios the investment manager expects that the majority of the fund’s investments will be in companies in which an underlying fund or a fund in which a small buyout portfolio is considering investing holds or is about to acquire a significant and in most cases controlling equity investment accordingly the fund will frequently acquire loans and in most cases equity investments in companies in which the small buyout portfolios hold an indirect equity interest through a fund investment in underlying funds in some cases the small buyout portfolios may also own additional equity securities in a fund portfolio company through a direct investment a company in which an underlying fund or a small buyout portfolio owns securities or will own securities when the fund completes its investment is referred to as a “related company” a company in which a small buyout portfolio owns securities or will own securities as a direct investment when the fund completes its investment is referred to as a “direct related company”   investment by the fund in related companies can give rise to potential conflicts of interest as described below to the extent that the investment manager believes that successful investments by the small buyout portfolios will create a greater economic benefit to the investment manager than successful investments by the fund or vice versa the potential conflicts described would be aggravated because the investment manager would have an economic incentive to favor one party over the other this divergent economic benefit could occur for example because of different compensation arrangements between the investment manager and the clients in question the relative size of the investments involved or because the relative investment performance of the various vehicles has made it more likely that the investment manager or its affiliates will collect more incentive compensation from one client or the other in addition the restrictions on affiliated transactions described below as well as those described under the caption “regulation” could prevent the fund from making certain transactions even when siguler guff believes it would be beneficial for the fund to make such an investment  negotiation of terms and conditions portfolio investments will consist primarily of debt securities and the investments in the same companies by underlying funds and if applicable direct investments by small buyout portfolios will consist primarily of equity securities the interests of debt investors differ significantly from the interests of equity investors in the same company for example debt investors will seek to negotiate the highest interest rate and fees possible and negotiate restrictive covenants and events of default to protect their overriding interest in being repaid as scheduled equity investors in contrast seek the lowest possible interest rate and fees and less restrictive covenants and events of default in most cases however the general partner of the underlying fund as the “lead investor” takes primary responsibility for negotiating the terms of the portfolio company’s borrowings and the small buyout portfolios will have a limited ability to participate in such negotiations the investment manager generally will have broad discretion to negotiate terms and conditions with respect to the portfolio investments   use of proceeds the investment manager anticipates that the proceeds of most loans made by the fund will be used to finance the acquisition of a borrower by a financial sponsor to refinance existing debt or to expand the borrower’s business through acquisition or organic growth the proceeds of some loans however may be used in whole or in part to finance distributions to the borrower’s equity investors a “dividend recapitalization” transaction the investment manager would permit the proceeds of a loan to be used for a dividend recapitalization only if the investment manager believes that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt notwithstanding its distribution of the loan proceeds to the equity holders financing a dividend recapitalization by a related company would benefit the small buyout portfolios as they would receive a portion of the proceeds of the dividend recapitalization   allocation of equity investment opportunities the fund will frequently make its debt and if applicable equity investment in a portfolio company at the same time as an equity investment in that portfolio company by the underlying fund and if applicable a direct investment by a small buyout portfolio equity investors typically seek to limit the amount of equity to be acquired by debt investors like the fund while the debt investors seek to maximize that amount to the extent that the fund secures an equity investment as part of a financing the amount of equity available to the small buyout portfolios indirectly through its fund investment in the underlying fund andor directly through a direct investment could be reduced   investment at different levels of the capital structure the small buyout portfolios and the fund may invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure including investments in loans and debt securities preferred equity securities and common equity securities to the extent permitted by applicable law the small buyout portfolios and the fund may invest in a portfolio company at a level that is the same as senior to or subordinate to an investment in the same company made by another fund or account managed by siguler guff this may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts of interest in that regard actions may be taken for the small buyout portfolios that are adverse to the fund   for example if the fund were to invest in the debt of a portfolio company in which a small buyout portfolio holds equity or some other interest junior to the fund’s debt the interests of the fund and such small buyout portfolio would be adverse the fund would be senior to the small buyout portfolio in the capital structure of such company and in a distress or workout scenario the fund could recover on its investment while the small buyout portfolio may not it is also possible that the small buyout portfolios could hold securities that are senior to those owned by the fund although for the entities and accounts that presently comprise the small buyout portfolios this is unlikely to occur because the existing small buyout portfolios concentrate on equity investments these situations would present numerous conflicts or the appearance of conflicts and the furtherance by the fund or the small buyout portfolio of their respective interests could cause a decline in the value of the other’s investment  in a different example a borrower may default under a loan from the fund the fund generally would have the ability to pursue a number of remedies including acceleration of the outstanding principal and interest foreclosing on collateral in the case of a secured loan and pursuing recovery against the borrower through the civil or bankruptcy courts borrowers may at times request that the fund waive enforcement of a loan covenant or other provision and the fund may demand that the borrower compensate the fund for the waiver through a cash payment or modification of loan terms under certain circumstances the investment manager may conclude that restructuring a defaulted loan or otherwise forbearing from exercising all the remedies available to the fund as a lender would ultimately result in a better outcome for the fund such forbearance could benefit the owners of the borrower’s equity securities which may include the small buyout portfolios in the case of related companies   certain policies in light of these potential conflicts of interest the investment manager will seek prior approval by the fund’s board of directors including a majority of the disinterested directors if a the fund invests in a related company and b the investment manager proposes that the fund engage in any of the following transactions   · a loan to a direct related company other than a loan primarily intended to finance a dividend recapitalization – see below if the fund is not acquiring equity securities with a value equal to at least  of the loan amount or warrants with an exercise price equal to at least  of the loan value   · if in connection with a loan to a direct related company the amount of equity available in the aggregate to the fund and one or more small buyout portfolios is limited by the equity sponsor or borrower to less than the aggregate amount desired by the fund and such small buyout portfolios the equity securities available to the fund will be limited to a maximum of a  of the loan amount plus b such additional amounts as are available after all the small buyout portfolios have acquired their desired allocations of the available equity securities this policy could result in the fund receiving an allocation that is less favorable than desired   · a loan to a related company if  or more of the loan proceeds can be used to finance a dividend recapitalization   · following a default by a related company forbearance from exercising one or more material available remedies   · restructuring of an existing loan to a related company that changes the interest rate amortization terms or maturity or   · any investment into a related company in which the small buyout portfolios and any other persons affiliated with the investment manager own in the aggregate  or more of the outstanding voting securities   in addition the fund will not invest in a related company if   · a person who is an affiliate of the investment manager is a voting member of the related company’s board of directors  · the small buyout portfolios and any other persons affiliated with the investment manager own in the aggregate  or more of the related company’s outstanding voting securities or   · the small buyout portfolios and any other persons affiliated with the investment manager “control” the related company as that term is defined under the  act   in addition when the fund invests in a related company   · the investment manager will provide a detailed report to the fund’s board of directors at each regular meeting regarding the fund’s investments in related companies including the amount and general terms of such investment the identity of the parties that cause the company to be a related company and the related company’s relationship with such parties and any recent significant developments that could affect the fund’s ability to be paid on its loan and   · the investment manager and its affiliates will seek consistent with their duties to the small buyout portfolios to make arrangements with the related company and its controlling shareholders to reduce the likelihood that personnel of the investment manager or its affiliates will receive information that could inhibit the ability of the fund to enforce its rights against the related company   effect of borrowings the investment management fee will be based on a percentage of cost basis of the fund’s assets including assets acquired with borrowed funds therefore decisions by the investment manager to cause the fund to borrow additional funds may increase the quarterly fees payable to the investment manager the fund’s overall borrowing limits however are set by the fund’s board of directors in light of its fiduciary obligations   indemnification and exculpation the charter of the fund authorizes it and the bylaws of the fund the “bylaws” obligate it to indemnify its directors officers employees and agents including the investment manager among others of the fund to the full extent permitted by maryland law and the  act including the advance of expenses and reasonable counsel fees the charter of the fund also contains a provision eliminating personal liability of a fund director or officer to the fund or its stockholders for money damages subject to specified exceptions a successful claim for such indemnification including payment of any expenses and counsel fees would reduce the fund’s assets by the amounts paid for a more detailed discussion of such indemnification provisions see the discussion herein at item  “indemnification of directors and officers”   selection of disinterested directors initially at the time the fund is formed a majority of the fund’s directors will be interested directors the board of directors of the fund intends that prior to the commencement of the fund’s operations a majority of the fund’s directors will be disinterested directors although the continued service of all directors will be subject to periodic election by the fund’s stockholders the initial selection of directors including the disinterested directors will be made by the investment manager   although the fact that the fund has a board of directors a majority of whose members are disinterested may mitigate certain conflicts it will not necessarily prevent or mitigate all conflicts or prevent or mitigate them to the extent desired   item  financial
