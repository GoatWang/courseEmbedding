face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful visa consultancy companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected company description we are a company that seeks to provide visa consultancy services to individuals or groups of individuals and legal entities we intend to consult our customers on the terms of how to obtain a visa to a particular country what the requirements are for visafree countries for instance a maximum period of stay or countries issuing visa on arrival we seek to provide full and uptodate information regarding documents difficulties or any limitations in the process of receiving a visa we plan to assist in gathering documents and filling out the forms either printed or online as an embassy requires or providing step by step guidelines and instructions to a successful completion of the process we may also offer to send the document packages to embassies or other related services the company is currently at the developing stage which means we are able to provide basic operations seeking to improve our services and expand the list of services we wish to be provided despite that there is a relatively long list of visafree countries travelling abroad people might face various difficulties as it is not always clearly stated how a visa is obtained whether it is issued upon arrival in case if it is whether it is paid and what is the period of visafree stay these data may vary from country to country some countries may be visafree in case the application is submitted through the website of their embassy such complications may lead to rejection in visa obtaining process so we intend to to provide our services that may be described as consultation or guidance regarding the steps ought to be taken in order to receive different kinds of visas to a foreign country in case if the country is visafree but the visa term is short we may assist in prolonging the period of stay by providing all the information from legal issues to any kinds of fees payment procedures in cases where visa is required or electronic visa may be issued we plan to provide our customers with full and uptodate guidelines on what legal or banking documents shall be gathered prior to the filling out the application how to fill out the application forms correctly which sorts of visas require receiving in person after an interview in the embassy on the terms and time spent waiting for the documents to arrive previously mentioned are the main steps which we may split into smaller tasks and guide our customers through every step for instance we provide the information regarding the list of the documents and places where they may be received as well as the amount of fees paid if it is required so also we may offer to collect those documents which do not require being obtained personally but can be received by proxy on legal basis we also may assist in making requests to the officials on behalf of our customers in cases when it is possible as additional services we may look for and provide interpreters for the cases when the applicant must present in person we intend to provide information on legal procedures the applicant will have to go through in the country of their choice depending on the aim of their visit for instance if they have to be registered with an official representative shortly after arrival and the applicants fail to do so or if they fail to leave the country of their stay before the free term of stay expires we plan to organize meeting with immigration officers or deputies to conduct a meeting devoted to the procedures of receiving visa for different purposes and the documents appropriate to that kind of visa we plan to provide the full stepbystep guidance and assistance to our customers as well as we plan to execute small independent operations such as guide through filling out only an application or sending sealed documents to the embassy and handing them back to our customers if the business succeeds it may expand into related markets and the company might offer additional services such as hotel booking airline or boat tickets booking transportation booking in the country of arrival and other similar services we provide our consulting servce in thailand for thai citezens thai people need visa for many countries in the world we provide visa
