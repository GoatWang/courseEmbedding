search form search share on facebook tweet widget google plus one linkedin share button pinterest managed future funds fees  expenses class action lawsuit in november  bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managedfutures” funds  the conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled  of all the profit of that given fund a managedfutures fund  is an alternative investment which is often defined as an investment other than cash stocks or bonds  typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments  barcalyhedge estimates that over  billion was invested in managed accounts in mid  sec reporting requirements  one difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” the sec does however require that all managed futures funds with more than  investors and more than  million in assets file financial reports within  days of their fiscal year’s end  bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently  managedfutures funds that fit into this category the vast majority of managedfutures funds therefore have no reporting requirement as they are not subject to the  investor rule bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses bloomberg concluded that managedfutures funds can charge clients  to  each year of the investment amount in the fund plus  percent of the funds’ profits  hedge funds typically only charge a  management fee plus  of investor profits bloomberg next concluded that for the period from jan   to dec   a stunning  of the  billion of gains in these  managedfutures funds went to fees commissions and expenses
