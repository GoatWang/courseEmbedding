between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net

news contact us menu homeabout usinvestment strategiesinvestment researchincome investingmarket commentaryin the newscontact us about us horizon kinetics llc founded in  is an independently owned and operated investment adviser we adhere to a longterm contrarian fundamental value investment philosophy that the founders established in  at bankers trust company horizon kinetics has over  employees with primary offices in new york city and white plains new york philosophy horizon kinetics was founded on the belief that a shortterm investment approach widely adopted with the modernization of financial markets ultimately produces suboptimal returns we believe that investors are better served not by taking more risk but by extending their investment time horizon which affords far wider ranges of opportunity and valuation than are available to timeconstrained institutional investors  the startling degree of return possibility ignored by a shortterm focus is most easily seen in the equity yield curve a chart you will not find elsewhere and while all acknowledge the tremendous power of compounding practically speaking and by definition this benefit simply cannot be harnessed in a short time frame our investment strategies – supported entirely by our independent fundamental research – typically reflect contrarian views that seek to take advantage of the shortterm focus of the marketplace find out more investment research publishing research has been the cornerstone of our investment process we believe that requiring research analysts to frame their investment ideas in writing helps avoid the common behavioral finance error of adjusting one’s investment thesis in response to shortterm market price fluctuations our research team produces a variety of research publications for the institutional investment community covering undervalued and often systematically mispriced classes of securities ranging from global spinoffs to distressed debt find out more investment strategies with a longterm absolute return mindset and based on firsthand research our portfolios tend to be concentrated and avoid tracking or mimicking any benchmark or index an investment and research process that is delinked from the standard shortterm relativereturn benchmarking that leads to crowdinvesting behavior should be expected to produce returns that are generally less correlated with other managers and funds accordingly our strategies might be considered diversifying elements within broader asset allocations horizon kinetics offers separately managed accounts
