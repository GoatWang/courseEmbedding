the project they act like they are your partner and that is why i would continue to choose them” lisa zimmerman formerly vice president clinical operations pozen inc     “to this day i use this study a phase iii crohn’s as my example of the best managed clinical trial i have been a part of the monitors knew the protocol in detail interacted with the site and cro staff extremely well closely and accurately monitored the sites and contacted me as appropriate their questions or concerns were appropriate and they discussed with me succinctly and in an articulate manner by writing and phone i appreciated the fact that i was more free to function as a medical monitor and i could have confidence in the oversight of the sites it was literally the most enjoyable experience i have had in my  year pharmaceutical career and i hope that i have the opportunity to work with such a group again“ medical monitor biopharma     “had an excellent experience working with scot kristen and sylvia – very professional and they provided excellent turn around time and response to questions and study needs the monitors kim s and maria g were knowledgeable hardworking and wellliked by their sites”
