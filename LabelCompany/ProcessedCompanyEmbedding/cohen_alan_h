and author of  inspirational books offers ten common reasons for why maladaptive thinking saps peoples energy and undermines the quality of their lives with evangelical zeal he takes readers to task

diagrams teens more so than adults may find the book helpful urban lifes greatest lessons takes a different tack and highlights  areas of focus that can help anyone realize a more satisfying life in the chapter about forgiveness for example the author explains how that act can be learned providing life stories of people who have changed their lives by forgiving rather than act like an overzealous

you like people to remember mickey mantle pale and gaunt still sporting his yankee cap he replied i would like them to think that i finally made something of myself i was shocked one of the most loved and celebrated sports heroes of all timemy herodid not respect himself until he took back the power he had given to his addiction a few months later mickey mantle died soon afterward i saw a touching newspaper cartoon showing mickey meeting god depicted as a person as the two ambled down a long road in heaven god placed his arm around mickeys shoulder mickey turned to god and wistfully remarked i cant believe all the errors i made god turned to mickey and answered but you gave them a ninth inning theyll never forget we have all given our power away to somethingmany thingsand our lives have sucked for it we have bestowed undue power to lovers money bosses addictive substances fame dream homes religious dogma parents children doctors lawyers agents therapists psychics teachers policemen politicians sports heroes movie stars gorgeous men and women business moguls the news and occult sciences the list goes on you can add more of your own you give your power away when you make someone or something outside of you more important than what is inside of youif you do not value who and what you are you will seek to borrow worth from the outer world you will look for validation from people whom you believe know or have more than you but since everything you need is inside you and no one can know more about your path and purpose than you do any power you ascribe to external authorities must eventually explode in your face and leave you feeling worse than when you started the question is not have you given your power away the question is how can you get it back unsucking your life is an inside job you do not need to import power for you were born with it you just need to plug the holes in your bucket through which it is leaking the quest is about peeling away the lies and illusions you have been toldand went on to tell yourselfthat have kept you living smaller than you deserve when you do you will be amazed to realize how much you have settled for then you will have little patience for halfhearted living and reclaim your right to live from choice rather than default any experience that leaves you feeling empty lessthan or needy does so for only one reason you entered into it feeling empty lessthan or needy the illusion is that relationships will take away the pain that keeps you feeling small the reality is that relationships magnify the pain that keeps you feeling small and yet there is a gift in the process you remember that the source of your strength is inside youperhaps the final lines of woody allens classic movie annie hall sum up how we stay trapped in painful situations a man says to a psychiatrist my wife thinks shes a chicken and shes driving me crazy the psychiatrist asks him so why dont you leave her the man answers i canti need the eggsyou dont need the eggs anymore they are rotten taste horrible and dont nourish you when you elevate others at your expense nobody wins when you source your life from inside out everyone wins as you strike gold in your own self you will quit giving the people in your world a carbon copy of the terror that runs their lives and give them a ninth inningor a first or a fifththeyll never forgethow you give your power away and what you can doyou put people on a pedestalformer child movie star shirley temple black discovered a flaw in the pedestal game at a young age she recounts i stopped believing in santa claus when i was six mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph the savior she sought was also seeking a savior in heridols always fall on those who worship them the bigger the idol the harder it crashes if you think any person has the power wealth wisdom beauty talent or strength to rescue you from your deficits you set yourself up for trouble yes there are people who can help support and teach you no there is no one out there who can save you that is something you have to do yourself by recognizing you already own what you seekwhen you have a crush on someone you will be crushed thats why they call it a crush you crush reality out of the other person by seeing them through the eyes of fantasy while you crush your own selfworth face it crushes buy you a ticket to a wild emotional rollercoaster ride for every giddy rush you experience you will soon be plummeting mr right smiles at you and you are in heaven the next day he looks the other way and you are in hell and you call this a relationship you wrap your soul in a little package hand it to someone you dont even know and instruct them here do with this as you wish crushes stay in force only from a distance it is easy to make a god out of a movie star rock idol sports hero girl in the class above you executive across the hall someone elses spouse or amorphous cyberspace fantasy lover but if you spent time on a daily basis with your idol you would discover they are a real person just like you you would find things you like about them and things you dont like he compares you to his former lovers and picks his toenails at the kitchen table she has morning breath and unresolved father issues in a short time your fantasy lover crashes from mount olympus to brooklyn ah now you can have a real relationship built from the earth up instead of heaven down and along the way you will discover your own worth intrinsic in you rather than bestowed by them if you indulge someone else putting you on a pedestal be prepared for an insurrection when they discover you are not who they thought you were or they cannot have you out come the spears it takes just a sixinch fall for a halo to become a noose rock star selena was killed by the former president of her fan club to avoid such an untimely demise stand naked in your humanity and refuse to accept googooeyed adoration which always comes with a price tag in the course of my work i have occasionally received letters from women who believe i am their soul mate while i feel complimented there is one problem in the equation they dont really know me they read my book or attended my seminar and decided i am the one for them yes i have done the same kind of thing when this first happened i didnt know how to handle their expression of affection and gave them ambiguous responses or none but my nonplan backfired sooner or later i would receive an angry letter chastising me for letting them down and not being the person i claimed to be but i never claimed to be that person they claimed i was that person and were upended by their lofty expectations then six months later i would receive another letter saying please forgive me i was insane now i am very careful not to put others on a pedestal or encourage anyone to do the same to me i respond as one perfectly imperfect human being to another which honors them along with me and paves the way for true communication plato explained true friendship can occur only among equalscults are an extreme example of giving power away to a spiritual leader rather than projecting romantic fantasies followers project religious fantasies but the dynamics are the same selfeffacement always leads to anger depression and selfstrangling religious leaders with integrity do not accept such adoration but deflect their followers desire to idolize they demonstrate by example there is just as much god in the student as the teacher buddhists teach if you meet the buddha on the road kill him if you encounter someone who you believe embodies more divinity than you get rid of the notion immediately we are all equal expressions of the great spirit and you only hurt yourself by elevating someone above you why become a buddhist when you can become a buddha carl jung exclaimed thank god i am not a jungian i wonder if jesus might say something similar the cult mentality leads to aberrant behavior like mass suicides at jonestown and heavens gate bottom line if someone tells you what tennis shoes to wear run like hell its going to be tricky falling in love with yourself if you are fascinated with someone else you can love someone respect them learn from them have a fabulous time with them and honor them as a role model just dont diminish yourself in the process we are told that jesus said even greater things than i shall you do indicating he regarded his students as powerful in their own right recognize that power within you and you wont have any pedestals crashing on you dont just love the one youre withbe the one you loveyou imitate instead of createimitation is the sincerest form of flattery but selfsuffocating if you do not grow beyond it ralph waldo emerson declared imitation is suicide to those who do not recognize their unique worth imitation looms attractive to those who know their strength imitation represents an unacceptable compromisein the early stages of skill or character development imitation is helpful if you choose a good role model when i first learned to cook i used recipes and turned out some tasty dishes but after a while i grew bored why follow someone elses formula when i could create my own after that i never cooked the same dish twice cooking became a great adventure imitating role models is like using training wheels on a childs bicycle they help you get going but once you find your own rhythm and balance you fly faster and farther without leaning on themin relationships imitation can hurt us if we subconsciously hold poor role models if as a child you observed people whose lives sucked you may have accepted their fear and pain as normal and gone on to settle for what they did then you espouse your cultures prejudices recreate your parents marriage and become the parent your parents were to you if you were empowered by the models you observed you are good to go but if what you saw delivered heartache you cannot afford to perpetuate it if you do not make strong choices for yourself you will reap the results of the weak choices of othersin the field of entertainment our culture glorifies celebrities who are talented in one domain but have not come to terms with the deeper issues of their lives they look great onscreen run like lightning on the football field or boast impressive bottom lines on their financial statementsbut when they step offscreen or off the playing field their personal lives are disastrous then you read about them oding shooting someone or mucking through a colossal divorce battle they are great role models for talent but terrible models for character if you are going to emulate someone focus on their talent not their aberration or just pick someone who is happyimitation also backfires on us in education as sophisticated as our school system is it still rewards conformity far more than originality if you learn how to play the school game you can regurgitate your way through your doctorate and still live a million miles from joy many of my college psychology professors were neurotic confused and caught up in a gnarly rat race of performance competition and mind games meanwhile the custodian who cleaned their offices whistled smiled and had a kind word for everyone he met who was closer to winning the game of lifein many industries you can maintain a livelihood by executing the formula massmarket movies have a formula as do novels and marketing plans they work and they work for a reason but such creations are typically nonmemorable and do not make any significant contribution except to put money in the pockets of the producers blessed is the person who is willing to follow their gut impulse to create something unique beyond the known think of the movies books teachers and friends who have affected you most deeply and you will realize that they did not fit the mold they touched you because their creations were motivated by inspiration not desperation the world is changed not by those who do what has been done before them but by those who do what has been done inside them creativity is as much a muscle as the heart and no less vitalthe more creative you are the more creative you become deny your visions and they atrophy creative people are tapped into an endless resource of ideas a creators dilemma is not running out of material it is what to do with all the material knocking at the door of imagination bumper sticker reality is for people who cant deal with imagination you will not connect with your muse by following the herd most of them are rambling over a cliff a smaller flock will take off when they reach the edge if you have been hypnotized to believe you are a lemming you will plunge with the crowd if you remember you have wings you will soarfortune is not something that happens to you it is something you createyou can make anything work in your favor study your role models accept the gifts they have bestowed and leave behind what does not serve you then you can say like gary de rodriguez i stand on the shoulders of my ancestors tragedies and declare triumph and know that they are cheering me onyou dont listen to your intuitiongoethe proclaimed when you finally trust yourself you will know how to live if you look back on mistakes you have made you can usually identify a little voice inside your head that was nudging you otherwise i cant believe i overlooked all the red flags you may note we get into trouble not because we do not know what to do but because we do not pay attention to what we know while you might regret not heeding your inner voice the experience leaves you with an important lesson you have access to impeccable wisdom all the timeimagine a radio station that well call know broadcasting sound advice from somewhere deep inside you  hours a day then imagine you have a tuner capable of receiving its signal if you set your tuner to the right frequency you hear the broadcast and pick up vital information if your dial is set elsewhere you miss the message you were born with your tuner set to know children and animals have their tuners well set they know who they are and can sense people and situations that match their wellbeing or threaten it as you became socialized you were seduced away from know you were taught that you are selfish if you do what you really want to do wrong if you disobey your parents wish for the kind of mate they would choose for you or foolish if you pursued a career in the arts that did not net an income as lucrative as computer programming eventually externallygenerated signals drowned out the voice of know and you felt lost and confused but you are not stupid you just disregarded what you knew in deference to the outer voices shrieking at youignorance and errors are easily rectified by respecting your inner genius several years ago i was planning to meet my musician friend charley thweatt in los angeles for a seminar we were to copresent charleys flight was scheduled to arrive at  am but in order for me to arrive around that time i would have had to fly out of portland around  am although i could have done this something inside me told me to book a later flight i judged myself as being lazy and felt guilty for asking charley to wait hours for me but i decided to go with my gut and i booked a flight to land around  pm when i arrived charley was not there i phoned his airline and learned that his connecting flight through denver had been delayed by snow he finally arrived at  pm listening to my inner voice paid off big time show more meet the author alan h cohen is the author of  popular inspirational titles including the dragon doesnt lives here anymore and dare to be
