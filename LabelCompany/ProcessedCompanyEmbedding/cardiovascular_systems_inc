maker of systems used in treating narrowing arteries in the leg excitement over the companys latest generation devices helped drive shares up more than  last year csii total return price data by ycharts an opportunity opens in treating padcardiovascular systems has been around since  but it wasnt until it launched its latest generation of systems for peripheral artery disease or pad that investors really took notice the devices help surgeons more effectively treat the build up of plaque in leg arteries a lack of blood flow means patients suffer pain when walking significantly affecting the patients quality of life patients can successfully improve their condition by quitting smoking eating better and exercising but for those with more advanced cases surgery is likely in those cases a common approach is angioplasty a procedure in which a catheter is used to reach the blockage in the artery and a balloon attached to the catheter is inflated to flatten the blockage sometimes a bare metal coated or drug eluting stent is also inserted to help keep the artery open those catheters and stents are sold by big medical device players like abbott nyse abt and johnson  johnsons cordis nysejnj and medtronic nysemdt abbott bolstered its position in pad stents with the acquisition of idev last july and has about a quarter of the broader vascular market according to trefis idevs supera veritas stent system has been sold in the eu since  and the company has filed for fda approval for use in the main artery of the thigh and jjs cordis bought pad stent developer flexible stenting solutions in march  that deal boosted cordis pad product line including the smart stent which has received the fda nod for use in arteries both above and at the knee not to be left out medtronic won fda approval in september for use of its complete se stent in those two arteries too  medtronic is also studying the use of a drugeluting balloon in pad procedures  the interest in building up product lines addressing pad is tied to its widespread prevalence the risk of developing pad climbs steadily through your s s and s and more than  of men older than age  develop the condition overall pad affects  to  of americans over the age of  and as many as  million people worldwide   source centers for disease control and prevention spinning its way to successcardiovasculars  pad devices help reduce the inflation pressure of balloons used in angioplasty by removing more of the calcium buildup along the vascular wall that calcium buildup occurs in between  and  of all pad patients the device removes the calcium by using an orbital spin to break the buildup down into particles smaller than blood cells the approach has been used to treat above and below the knee buildup in more than  patients during clinical trials and more than  devices have been sold since winning approval from the fda in  that number is expected to climb following an approval for the use of the companys orbital approach in coronary arteries last october  its estimated that calcium buildup occurs in about  of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty since estimates peg the coronary procedure market at  billion a year investors appear willing to accept dilution  to advance the devices use in coronary patients the company raised nearly  million in a public stock offering in november the coronary market opportunity could prove significant given the companys sales which climbed  yearoveryear were just  million last quarter cardiovascular expects sales in its fiscal second quarter ending december to grow  to  to  million foolworthy final thoughtstrial costs and precoronary launch expenses pushed the company to a  million loss last quarter and the company is guiding for a loss of  million in fiscal q but margins are healthy at  suggesting uptake in the coronary indication may present profit opportunity over the coming years as higher unit volume is leveraged against fixed costs since the coronary indication could be so significant to the companys quest for profit investors should keep a close eye on the company to see if the device gains traction for the indication
