reading the main story photo jeffrey sprecher chief executive of intercontinentalexchange in its atlanta offices credit rich addicks for the new york times when nearly all else had failed jeffrey c sprecher flew to new york city and crashed at his sisters’ apartment a cramped walkup on the upper west side one flight above a noisy barit was january  and mr sprecher had been coldcalling wall street for weeks he was searching desperately for someone to back his small company in atlanta a business that was eating up his money and years of his lifethat’s when a black limousine pulled up in front of the bar jake’s dilemma the limo had been sent by the mighty goldman sachs to fetch mr sprecher and as he sank into the back seat that winter day he set off on an improbable journey that has since taken him to the pinnacle of american financetoday mr sprecher a man virtually unknown outside of financial circles is poised to buy the new york stock exchange not one of the  or so stocks traded on the new york stock exchange combined value of those shares about  trillion no jeff sprecher is buying the entire new york stock exchange advertisement continue reading the main story it sounds preposterous a businessman from atlanta blows into new york and walks off with the colonnaded high temple of american capitalism but if all goes according to plan his  billion acquisition announced a few days before christmas will close later this year and with that  years of wall street history will come to an end no more will new york be the master of the new york stock exchange instead from its bland headquarters  miles from wall street mr sprecher’s young company intercontinentalexchange will run the largest stock exchange in the nation and the world continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr sprecher  certainly plays the role of a wily upstart he may wear power suits and a patek philippe watch but he comes across as unusually casual and selfdeprecating for a man in his position he pokes fun at himself for his shortcomings — “i don’t know how to manage people” he says — and his love of obscure documentarieshow the new york stock exchange fell into mr sprecher’s hands is at heart a story of the disruptive power of innovation ice as intercontinentalexchange is known did not even exist  years ago it has no cavernous trading floor no gilded halls no sweaty brokers braying for money on the financial markets what it has is technologylike many young companies that are upending the old order in business ice has used computer power to do things faster and cheaper if not always better than people can its rapid ascent reflects a new wall street where highspeed computers now dominate trading sometimes with alarming consequences new electronic trading systems have greatly reduced the cost of buying and selling stocks thus saving mutual funds — and by extension ordinary investors — countless millions but they have also helped usher in a period of hairraising volatilitymr sprecher pronounced sprecker has probably done more than anyone else to dismantle the trading floors of old and replace human brokers with machines along the way he and ice have traced an arc through some of the defining business stories of our time — from the rise and fall of enron to the transformation of oldschool investment banks into vast trading operations to the wall street excesses that not long ago helped derail the entire economy now after a series of bold acquisitions he is about to become the big boss of the big boarddoes it really matter who owns the new york stock exchange and its parent company nyse euronext for most people stock exchanges are probably a bit like plumbing most of us don’t think much about them — until something goes wrong but lately some things have gone spectacularly wrongone sign of trouble came in  when an errant trade ricocheted through computer networks and touched off one of the most harrowing moments in stock market history the dow jones industrial average plunged  points in a matter of minutes and a new phrase entered the lexicon flash crashsince then flash crashes in individual stocks have been remarkably common as the centuriesold system of central exchanges has given way to a field of competing electronic systems advertisement continue reading the main story ice wasn’t involved in any of these problems in fact it has been praised as one of the first exchanges to put limits on lightningquick highfrequency trading this points to mr sprecher’s deftness in piloting his company through periods of regulation deregulation and now reregulationwhile many banking executives have clashed with washington mr sprecher has sensed the changing winds and tacked accordingly he also stays close — some say too close — to the powerful wall street firms that are his customersit is perhaps unsurprising that some of the people who make their living on the big board’s floor are a bit nervous about the exchange’s new boss but mr sprecher says they have nothing to fear his friends and business associates say he could actually turn out to be the best hope for restoring trust in the stock market after all he has beaten the odds before“there were a number of times when the odds were long but he wasn’t deterred from stepping in” says james newsome who was mr sprecher’s regulator at the commodity futures trading commission before becoming his competitor as chief executive of the new york mercantile exchange “a lot of people if they don’t think they will win they won’t participate jeff doesn’t operate like that”for now mr sprecher is still spending much of his time at ice’s headquarters in suburban atlanta the contrast with the new york stock exchange is striking behind its neoclassical face the big board is a sprawling labyrinth of historic oil paintings gilded leather chairs stained wood and elegant dining rooms — all set amid crowds of gawking touristsice meanwhile occupies a few floors of an anodyne blackglass cube surrounded by trees and parking lots the employees share their cafeteria with the building’s other tenants the walls are lined with dryerase boardson a recent weekday the whiteboard in mr sprecher’s modest corner office was filled with columns of scribbled numbers they were leftovers from the allnight sessions that led to the deal for the big boardone column was labeled “yankees” ice’s code name for the new york stock exchange another was labeled “braves” a shorthand for ice on the margins was a doodle of a tree with a cat hanging from one of the branches in a hangintherebaby vein it was done mr sprecher says by his wife kelly loeffler who also happens to be his director of investor relations advertisement continue reading the main story “this negotiation had fits and starts” mr sprecher says “there were days when we just wanted to throw each other out of the window”but mr sprecher didn’t blink not even at the billions of dollars lined up under the yankees column“it’s not about the value of what you paid for because you are going to change the underlying business to begin with” he says “you acquire companies at moments in time when there’s an inflection point and you can change the trajectory of the company and the industry”the new york taxi driver asked “what brings you to this concrete hellhole”he was talking to mr sprecher then a young man visiting new york for the first time from his home in wisconsin“i was terrified” mr sprecher recalls of that visit in the sat the time mr sprecher was still a smalltown kid the son of an insurance salesman and a medical technician in madison wis it was decades before ice existed before it owned exchanges on three continents and before it became a venue to trade everything from midwestern wheat to brazilian coffee to scandinavian oilback then he stayed with his sister jill sprecher who had come to new york to study filmmaking according to her mr sprecher was the archetype of the older brother confident competent and protective the type whom all the teachers remember and judge younger siblings against his most distinguishing trait was his knack for taking things apart and putting them back together — and for making money“everything he touched always made money where everything i touched lost money” says ms sprecher who writes and directs independent films with their sister karenbut not even jill sprecher would have guessed that her brother would one day stand atop the new york stock exchange advertisement continue reading the main story “what has happened to him since  is beyond my comprehension” she saysmr sprecher’s first job after college was as a salesman for the industrial company trane a job he says he got thanks to good grades and a reputation for being the life of the party at sigma alpha epsilon he accepted the job because it took him to southern california“it was the ticket to the beach and palm trees and girls on roller skates and i was like ‘that’s what i want to do in life’ ” he recallswhile at trane he made an early sales pitch to william prentice an entrepreneur who was developing power plants it was  and the nation’s electricity market had just been deregulated allowing entrepreneurs to start their own power plants which only utilities had been allowed to do in the past mr prentice impressed that mr sprecher recognized the industry was in the middle of big changes almost immediately offered him a job at his new company the western power group“he had already internalized the whole concept of creative destruction” mr prentice sayswestern power got off to a rocky start it almost failed when a canadian company threatened to corner its local energy supply cow manure others at the western power group grew despondent mr sprecher and mr prentice spent weeks in a motel in california’s imperial valley trying to persuade the suppliers to change their minds“we called it ‘the manure wars’ ” mr prentice says “neither myself nor jeff questioned the need to go and fight there was never any secondguessing — it was just go do it and win”win they did after mr prentice sold his stake in the company a few years later mr sprecher continued building the western power group until another round of electricity deregulation occurred in  then he

subscribed to this email view all new york times newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime previously power plant owners who wanted to buy and sell surplus electricity had to call one another and agree on a price mr sprecher saw opportunity in an atlanta company that provided an electronic trading network he bought that company the continental power exchange with his own money he ended up putting  million into italthough mr sprecher kept his company in california and his house in beverly hills he spent every spare hour trying aggressively to sign up utility companies for the atlanta exchange his team made many visits to enron where they met with top executives like jeffrey skilling who is now serving time in prison those meetings ended one day when the enron executives began asking a number of technical questions about mr sprecher’s system“we sat there in the meeting and we realized these guys are building this themselves and we are educating them” mr sprecher recalls advertisement continue reading the main story shortly thereafter enron started its own electricity trading platform which quickly came to dominate the industry it looked as if the continental power exchange was done but enron made one big mistake rather than providing a place for buyers and sellers to meet enron itself bought from every seller and sold to every buyerthis angered wall street banks that were among the biggest traders of energy products when mr sprecher showed up in new york to stay with his two sisters in  nearly ready to give up on his own system he didn’t know that morgan stanley and goldman sachs had been looking for someone just like him who could provide an alternative to enronas mr sprecher shuttled between meetings at the two banks the bankers were trading phone calls and buzzing“we were all thinking ‘this is the guy we want’ ” recalls john a shapiro who was involved in the talks at morgan stanley “we had already talked to a number of people and the difference was night and day”the difference wasn’t the atlanta exchange’s technology say people who were involved it was mr sprecher himself“at some point you said ‘ok this guy has got something going for him maybe it’s hard to put your finger on it but you know it when you see it’ ” mr shapiro recallson the other side it was the perfect time to be hooking up with wall street as banks were focusing increasingly on trading in the negotiations that followed mr sprecher used what would become a trademark strategy giving up part of the ownership of his company in exchange for a promise that the recipients would use his platform in this case he gave up  percent of the ownership to the two banks the banks soon turned around and gave part of their own stakes to several of the largest power companies including shell total and british petroleum which committed to using what was soon rechristened as intercontinentalexchangewhen enron collapsed in scandal the business began pouring inby their own account mr sprecher and his wife ms loeffler live for ice he has some hobbies and his sister jill wonders how he finds the time to watch cooking shows and reality television but he and his wife have no children ms loeffler the more serious of the two says the thing that brought them together was their willingness and desire to do their jobs around the clock advertisement continue reading the main story “we both just work all the time and enjoy work” ms loeffler saysboth revel in the brinkmanship that has marked ice’s climb two days before mr sprecher and his wall street backers announced the creation of ice in  they offered the new york mercantile exchange or nymex a  percent stake in the new business if nymex would share some of its backoffice serviceswhile mr sprecher was giving his presentation to the board a director said “who the hell brought this guy into our board meeting”mr sprecher recalled “then the room went silent” the next thing he knew a guard was escorting him out of the buildingice was confronting a trading world that had ossified into an almost ritualistic society the exchanges were owned by their traders who made the rules the traders themselves were roughandtumble men who used their fists as computers from the beginning of ice mr sprecher was seen by the oldtime traders as a tool of wall street banks that wanted to supplant local traders at the exchanges — a reputation he has never managed to shake fullyfor his part mr sprecher rarely showed deference to traditional powerswhen nymex was bidding for the international petroleum exchange in london in  ice doubled nymex’s offer and won within a few years ice had shut down the historic trading pits at the london exchange in favor of computerized tradingnext up in  was the new york board of trade where financial contracts tied to agricultural products like sugar and cocoa were bought and sold mr sprecher says people looked askance at him when he offered a billion dollars for it “i really believed there was a fundamental change going on in the globalization of commodities” he sayspeople involved in the deal say mr sprecher was initially attentive to the concerns of the floor traders“he had the capability to disarm people — you might even say charm people — into accepting his softspoken demeanor” says frederick w schoenhut who was the chairman of the new york board of trade advertisement continue reading the main story but as soon as the deal went through mr sprecher was seldom seen what’s more he put a manager in his s in charge of the new york operations mr sprecher says that was intentional“i wanted to show that market that there was a much younger aggressive guy here who really wanted to fundamentally change that company” he saysice didn’t have to do much to initiate that change it allowed customers to choose between trading on the floor or on ice’s electronic system within months most customers had migrated to the screen the situation caused so much job loss and unhappiness that when ice made its next takeover bid for the chicago board of trade a crew of new york board of trade traders took out newspaper ads warning the chicago traders to “watch their backs” ice ultimately lost that battle but only after almost derailing a rival bid by slipping an offer under a hotel room doorice also attracted the ire of a number of democratic senators who said it was encouraging speculation that caused fluctuations in the price of essential commodities like oil but mr sprecher proved adept at defanging his political opponents by bending to their will“tell me what the rules are and i’ll figure out how we can make money around them” is one of his common lines when talking to regulators in washingtonsince the financial crisis mr sprecher has used that attitude to position himself to take advantage of changes being brought by the doddfrank financial overhaul soon wall street firms will have to move trading in many opaque financial products to exchanges and ice is in a perfect position to profitthe clear attraction of the deal for nyse euronext is that it will create a global force in futures trading an area set to benefit from doddfrank reforms in the united states ice is now the secondmostimportant futures trading company after the chicago mercantile exchange nyse euronext owns one of the most important futures exchanges in europethe future of the new york stock exchange on the other hand is less clear for someone who is buying a stock exchange mr sprecher is very critical of the state of stock markets advertisement continue reading the main story “there are so many places where you say fundamentally something does not feel good to the average investor on what used to be the greatest capital markets in the world” he says but all of this is what makes stock trading an attractive industry for him — it is one that is ripe for change he is already speaking out about a need to reform the rules governing stock marketsat the exchange itself last wednesday the some men and women who work on the big board’s floor filed through the doors at  wall street in trading jackets of blue red and green over the years their number has dwindled steadily as computerized trading put many out of workeven before ice swooped in some wondered how long the big board’s floor the scene of so many triumphs and failures could enduremr sprecher says the floor will survive the american stock market and the nation need it“the pendulum of electronification of markets went too far in the case of us equities — to the point that people want to know there’s a human being watching over their trades” he saysbut that’s now and jeff sprecher hasn’t gotten to where he is by keeping things as they are
