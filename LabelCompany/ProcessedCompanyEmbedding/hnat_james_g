the melting of pulverized glass batch concurrent with the combustion of a fuel in a high temperature vortex melting system in presently available gas or oil fired glass melting operations the glass product is formed by melting mineral matter glass batch in an openhearth type furnace many design changes have been incorporated into these furnaces since the original patents obtained by the siemens family in the late s however the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms for melting the glass batch are still quite similar to those in the original furnaces because openhearth furnaces primarily rely on radiation from the flame and crown for heat transfer to the batch being melted the surface area of the melter is necessarily large this large surface area even with substantial insulation leads to wall heat transfer losses which are in the order of  per cent of the thermal input into the melter thses high wall heat transfer losses coupled with the heat losses associated with the stack gas and glass product sensible heat are the major factors contributing to the low operating efficiency of current furnace designs typical heat rates for current furnace designs range from  million btu to  million btu per ton of glass produced the heat rate for the vortex melting systems of the present invention using conventional heat recovery technology is projected to be in the range of  million to  million btuton without electric boosting projections are that heat rates as low as  million btuton are possible if advanced heat recovery technology is utilized numerous attempts have been made to improve furnace efficiency over the past  years descriptions of innovative glass melting concepts for which development has been attemped have been compiled by a g pincus in melting in the glass industry volumes books for industry new york  of particular note is the furnace invented by alexander ferguson in  which is reported to have melted  mesh glass batch in suspension in a refactory lined cyclone type furnace in addition a number of plasma arc furnaces have also been developed which incorporate suspension melting several of these furnace designs are described in the journal of minerals science engineering volume  no  july  plasma arc furnaces rely heaviy on the use of electric power for the melting process and although different in principle from the gas or oilfired vortex glass melting process do demonstrate the ability to melt glass and ceramic type products in suspension summary of the invention the primary purpose of this invention is to melt glass and glasslike products in a thermally efficient manner in a high temperature gas or oilfired vortex melting system the process invention assumes the vortex melter incorporates the essential combustion stabilization and particulate separation features of slagging coal combustors such as the avco toroidal vortex combustor the trw horizontal cyclone combustor the petc vertical reverse flow cyclone combustor and the ge axial swirl cyclone combustor developed for the us department of energy for magnetohydrodynamic mhd power generation applications andor conventional cyclone combustors such as those developed by babcock  wilcox for steam generation a second objective of the invention is to reduce the nox and sox flue gas emissions relative to those emissions typical for current gas or oilfired openhearth type glass furnaces a third objective is to provide operational flexibility in terms of improved startup and shutdown and product changeover capability a fourth objective is to reduce the furnace capital cost through the elimination or at least minimization of melter refractories the present vortex glass melting process relates to the melting of pulverized glass batch concurrent with the combustion of gas or oil or other fuels in a high temperature vortex melting system a primary distinction between the use of the vortex chamber for glass melting applications versus its use for mhd power generation or steam generation relates to the embodiment of the device as a method of conserving fuel through the reduction of heat losses for glass melting as opposed to the combustion of coal or other fuel for the production of a high temperature mhd plasma or steam the present process incorporates efficient heat transfer to pulverized glass ingredients and low wall heat losses in a high temperature vortex type reactor while providing additional process capabilities which cannot be achieved in current commercial glass melting systems specifically the use of the vortex melter provides for the potential control of nox formation via staged combustion and combustion product timetemperature control the vortex melter eliminates the use of expensive refractory bricks in the glass melting zone and the vortex melter allows for rapid startup and shutdown and product changeover due to reduced use of refractories and reduced glass inventory within the melter the production of reduced flint glass without the use of salt cake also appears feasible in one embodiment of the process of the present invention glass forming materials are melted in a vortex reactor by preheating first glass batch material or materials in an entrained flow gas or oilfired suspension preheater this entrained gassolids suspension is then mixed with a second glass forming material or materials along with oxidant andor fuel in an injector nozzle assembly thereby producing a second gassolids suspension the second gassolids suspension is introduced into the reaction chambr of a vortex reactor in such a manner as to produce a vortex flow the vortex flow within the reaction chamber provides for flame stabilization for a second stage of combustion provides additional suspension heating of the glass batch materials and disperses the preheated particulates to the walls of the reactor by fluid mechanically induced centrifugal forces the interdispersed preheated glass materials which are dispersed to the reactor chamber walls coalesce and react to form a molten liquid glass layer on the reacter chamber walls the motion of the liquid glass layer within the vortex reactor under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces and gravity rapidly refines and homogenizes the liquid formed glass the rapidly refined and homogenized glass then passes to a reservoir under the influence of these forces where final refining and homogenization occurs brief description of figures additional objectives and a more complete understanding of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the formal drawings wherein fig  is a process diagram depicting the primary process steps of the vortex melting process fig  is an isometric sketch of a suspension preheater assembly with a circular exit area fig  is an isometric sketch of a suspension preheater with a rectangular exit area fig  is an isometric sketch of a toroidal vortex reactor as

sketch of the wall zone of a vortex reactor showing the motion of the glass layer under the influence of active water cooling and gas dynamic shear forces detailed description of the invention to practice the method of this invention pulverized glassmaking materials and sequentially and segmentally preheated in a suspension preheater and injector assemblies such as nozzle or swirlvane injectors and subsequently introduced into a vortex reactor whereby additional combustion particle heating and particle mixing occurs with the batch ingredients being separated by fluid mechanical centrifugal separation forces to the reactor vessel walls where the preheated particulates coalesce and glass forming reactions occur homogenization and refining take place as the formed glass moves along the walls of the reaction vessel in a thin layer under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces and gravity the process invention sequentially and segmentally preheats three classes of glass batch ingredients class i batch ingredients are defined as glassmaking materials which do not decompose readiy upon heating and the oxides of these materials have relatively low vapor pressures ie less than about  of the species in the vapor phase at temperatures typically for glassmaking operations ie ° f° f examples of class i batch ingredients are sand cullet syenite and burned lime class ii batch ingredients are defined as glassmaking materials which decompose or offgas readily upon heating but the oxides of these materials have relatively low vapor pressures at glass melting temperatures examples of class ii batch materials are limestone caco and dolomite caomgoco for these class ii ingredients co is driven off upon heating to temperatures above about ° f the remaining oxides cao and mgo however have low vaor pressure and remain stable at temperatures to well above ° f class iii batch materials are ingredients which decompose readily upon heating and the remaining oxides have relatively high vapor pressures ie greater than about  of the species in the vapor phase at glass melting temperatures examples of class iii glass batch ingredients are soda ash na co and potassium carbonate k co for class iii materials temperature elevation drives off the co and can also substantially vaporize the remaining alkali oxide the relatively low melting points of some class iii ingredients can limit the extent of preheating of these materials prior to introduction into the vortex reactor since plugging of the nozzle or swirlvane injector assemblies can occur at temperatures in excess of about ° f in this regard the melting points of na co and k co are ° f and ° f respectively the process is designed to efficiently utilize liquid or gaseous fuels with gaseous fuels including low btu medium btu high btu and reformed gases the liquid fuels can include oil methanol ethanol and other liquid hydrocarbon fuels in this process invention the glass batch ingredients are sequentially and segmentally preheated to provide temperature control of the batch materials during preheating in order to minimize alkali oxide vapor loss and to minimize plugging problems during preheating staged combustion is utilized to limit nox formation a controlled reducing environment can be provided in the vortex reactor for the production of preferably reduced flint glass with minimal use of sulferbased refining agents the basic process steps of the invention are embodied in the process diagram depicted in fig  and are given physical perspective in figs  the basic process steps are preheating of pulverized class i and class ii batch ingredients  in a suspension preheater  to produce a first preheated gassolids suspension  introducing class iii batch ingredients  into a injector assembly  such as a nozzle or swirlvane injector introducing the first gassolids suspension  into the injector assembly  and mixing the first gassolids suspension  with the second batch ingredient  in the injector assembly  to produce a second gassolids suspension  providing a vortex reactor  where a second stage of fueloxidant reaction occurs the glass making materials being preheated and interdispersed in suspension and subsequently separated to the reactor walls from the gas stream by fluid mechanical centrifugal forces in a primary separationreaction section  of the vortex reactor  forming melted glass  in a thin layer along the reactor walls by the coalesence and reaction of the preheated batch materials producing a rapidly homogenized and refined glass  in a rapid refining section  of the vortex reactor  by mixing the glass layer along the reactor walls under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces collecting the hot product glass  in a distributor reservoir  wherein final homogenization and refining take place and removing the hot flue gas  through an exhaust duct  and preferably directing the hot gas to a waste heat recovery system the interface boundary a shown in fig  identifies the major process steps various means may be provided for recovering waste heat from the flue gas  delivering preferably preheated class i and class ii batch ingredients  to the suspension preheater  delivering preferably preheated fuel  to the suspension preheater  delivering preferably preheated oxidant  to the suspension preheater  delivering preferably preheated class iii batch ingredients  to the injector assembly  or  delivering preferably preheated fuel  to the injector assembly  delivering preferably preheated oxidant  to an injector assembly  or  delivering the flue gas  exiting the vortex reactor to a waste heat recovery system delivering the hot product glass  exiting the reservoir  to forehearths delivering cooling water not shown to the system and delivering the heated cooling water not shown to process or heat recovery facilities the suspension heater  is provided primarily to preheat the class i and class ii batch ingredients  in suspension without the initiation of glass forming reactions this is accomplished by either mixing the batch ingredients  with preheated oxidant  or by mixing the batch ingredients  with the combustion products resulting from the reaction of fuel  in a suspension type preheater  or by both methods the suspension preheater  can include recirculation zones for flame stabilization and enhanced heat transfer however separation of the glass ingredient particulates from the gas stream is not a necessary purpose of this preheating step the temperature of the batch ingredients  entering the suspension preheater  is typically on the order of ° f° f depending on the extent of preliminary batch preheating preliminary suspension preheating included as part of the waste heat recovery system shown in fig  will enhance the efficiency of the glass melting process however it is not essential the temperature of the preheated oxidant  delivered to the suspension preheater  is typically in the range of ° f to ° f depending to some extent on the type of heat recovery utilized and the level of oxygen enrichment with high levels of oxygen enrichment materials limitations and safety considerations will generally limit the oxidant preheat temperature to ° f or less the size distribution of the class i and class ii batch ingredients  delivered to the suspension preheater  are in the range of  percent mesh to  percent mesh which is finer than the  mesh batch ingredients which are typically used in glass melting operations in conventional open hearth furnaces the average temperature of the gassolids suspension  exiting the suspension preheater is approximately ° f to ° f depending on the oxidant used the level of preliminary batch preheating the solids loading and whether or not fuel combustion is used in the preheating step with fuel combustion stochiometries in the range of  percent to  percent are typical with substoichiometric opertion being preferred as a means of limiting nox formation the fuel  for the suspension preheater is preferably preheated gas or oil the oxidant  is preferably air oxygenenriched air or pure oxygen the class iii batch ingredients  such as soda ash na co and potassium carbonate k co are introduced into an injector assembly or assemblies  for distribution into the vortex reactor  the class iii ingredients are mixed with the preheated gassolids suspension  in the injector assembly however the primary heating for these species occurs within the reactor the objective of staging or segmenting the species injection is to limit and control the timetemperature history of the class iii batch ingredients so as to minimize alkali oxide vapor phase losses to the combustion products the injector assembly  which can be for example a nozzle or swirlvane injector can include provisions for introducing additional oxidant  and fuel  as a means of providing supplementary heat release for augmented batch preheating and controlling the stoichiometry and temperature within the vortex reaction chamber the temperature of the class iii batch ingredients  delivered to the injector assembly is typically in the range of ° f° f the oxidant  delivered to the injector assembly can be air oxygenenriched air or pure oxygen preheat temperatures typically are in the range of ° f to ° f depending on the type of heating utilized and the level of oxygen enrichment a separate injector  is an alternative means of introducing the oxidant into the reacter the fuel  delivered to the injector assembly is preferably gas oil reformed gas or any other gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon fuel the size distribution of the class iii ingredients is typically in the range of  percent mesh to  percent mesh selection of the size distribution provides a means of controlling the timetemperature history of the batch ingredients within the vortex reactor all of the total batch ingredients are heated in suspension within the vortex reactor by the combined effects of convective radiative and particleparticle heat transfer the ingredients introduced are separated from the gas stream within the reactor by fluid mechanically induced centrifugal forces produced by the confined vortex  and distributed to the inside walls  of the reactor  where coalescense of the batch ingredients and initial glass forming reactions occur by proper control of combustion tempertures particle size distributions and heat release rate the particulates collecting on the vortex reactor walls will be close to the glass melting temperature which is typically in the range of ° f° f depending on the type of glass being produced entrance velocities of the oxidants fuel and gassolids suspension entering the reactor coupled with the geometry and orientation of the injector assemblies and the geometry of the vortex reactor determine the particulate separation performance of the reacter injection velocities typically range from  ms to  ms and the process drops across the vortex milting system range from  psi to  psi depending primarily on the level of particulate separation efficiency pressurized operation of the melter up to  atm is possible however atmospheric operation is more compatible with conventional glass melting operations the preferably watercooled walls  of the reactor are of a wetting type design to ensure that bare hot sports do not occur metal wall construction similar to that developed for mhd slagging combustors has been found to be an effective wall construction design the initial glass  formed along the reactor walls  moves along the walls under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces and gravity the motion of the thin glass layer under the influence of these forces rapidly refines and homogenizes the glass to form a rapidly refined molten glass  the rapid homogenization and refining occurs in a section  of the reactor which is simply an extension of the primary vortex separation and glass forming section  of the reactor  the rapidly refined and homogenized glass  enters a reservoir  for final refining and homogenization the final refined and homogenized glass  exits the reservoir  and passes to forehearths or other devices for final glass manufacturing flue gas  exits the reactor through a preferably watercooled exhaust duct  the preferred location and geometry of the exhaust duct is dependent on the type of reactor being utilized for the melting process the hot flue gas  is preferably directed to a waste heat recovery system the flue gas temperatures are typically in the range of ° f° f depending primarily on the type of glass being produced toroidal vortex melting a preferred embodiment of the vortex melting process of this invention is the application to a toroidal vortex system as shown in figs  and  in fig  the force of gravity is in the negative z direction and the z axis is the axis of rotation of the vortex reactor vessel in this glass melting process the batch ingredients are separately preheated and staged combustion of the fuel is used as a means for controlling nox formation as well as the timetemperature history of the batch ingredient particulates preheating of the class i and ii batch ingredients  occurs in a suspension preheater  by mixing the batch ingredients with the combustion products  formed from the reaction of preferably preheated fuel  and preferably preheated oxidant  the stoichiometry of combustion ranges from  percent to  percent with substoichiometric fuel rich combustion being preferred as a means for controlling nox formation class ii batch ingredients may be injected along with the class i batch ingredients since flame quenching in the combustor is mitigated by injecting the batch ingredients downstream of the flame zone f the combustion products  formed from the combustion of the fuel are generally in the range of ° f to ° f depending on the type of fuel used oxidant used level of preheating and combustion stoichiometry if fuel is used in the preheating step the average temperature of the gassolids suspension  leaving the preheater  will generlly be in the range of ° f to ° f depending preliminary on the solidstogasloading ratio the stoichiometry of combustion and level of oxidant preheat if fuel  is not used in the suspension preheater the resuting gassolids mixture  will have an average temperature in the range of ° f to ° f depending primarily on the level of oxidant preheat and the solidstogas loading thegassolids suspension  exiting the suspension preheater is mixed with class iii batch ingredients  in a nozzle assembly  to form a mixture of class i ii and iii batch ingredients  which is injected into the vortex reactor  the nozle assembly is designed to receive an additional oxidant injection  and fuel injection  in order to control the combustion stoichiometry within the vortex reacter partial reaction of the fuel constituents of gassolids stream  if fuel rich with oxidant stream  or the reaction of the oxidants in stream  if oxidant rich with the fuel stream  may occur in the nozzle assembly  however the primary second stage combustion occurs in the vortex reactor  wherein the toroidal vortex  provides flame stabilization the final stoichiometry in the vortex reactor will be typically in the range of  percent to  percent with slightly reducing conditions preferred as a means of producing reduced flint glass in conjunction with constraining the level of nox emissions the dispersed and preheated glass making ingredients  leaving the nozzle assembly are introduced into the vortex reactor  through a plurality of nozzle assemblies    attached to the vortex chamber wall there are preferably three nozzle assemblies each nozzle assembly being an injector attached to an individual preheater assembly  and the reactor the exit area of each nozzle defines the velocity of the jet of the preheated ingredients  entering the vortex primary separation section  of the reactor typical injection velocities range from  msec to  msec the nozzle assemblies are oriented to provide an inclination of °° with the horizontal and are directed towards a common focal point  along the center line of the chamber and are approximately one diameter below the chamber dome an inclination angle of ° for the nozzle assemblies is nearby the optimum for vortex separation performance within the primary vortex section  the injector nozzles    are spaced at ° around the circumference of the primary vortex section  of the reactor within the primary vortex separation and glass forming section  combustion reactions occur and heat is transferred to the batch ingredients via wall radiation convective heat transfer from the combustion products and particleparticle heat transfer which includes both radiation and impact effects at the impingement point  the gas and glass ingredient jets impact and turn vertically upwards to form a central core  of a toroidal vortex  which encompasses the dome area and forms the primary vortex separation section  the toroidal motion of gas and particles within the dome area results in the centrifugal separation and dispersion of the glass ingredient particles toward the inside walls  of the reactor where the molten andor hot glass ingredient particles interact to form a molten glass layer  via reactions with the other batch ingredients the melt layer  is formed by the distribution and coalescence of the hot and molten particulates along the wall zone of the primary vortex section the distribution of particulates within the dome area is essentially homogeneous and leads to circumferential uniformity in the melt layer during the suspension heat up of the batch materials the partial liberation of co and h o reduces the refining requirements of the glass formed along the reactor walls the glass melting reactions occur at temperatures typically in the range of ° f° f the melting reactions in the melt layer are supported by heat transfer to the walls by radiation convection and particulate heat transfer the preferably metal reactor walls are designed to be wetted by the molten glass  to ensure that bare spots do not form along the chamber walls the grooved design shown in fig  which includes refractory wetting strips  is known to be an effective wall design the glass layer formed along the inside walls  of the reactor is typically on the order of  cm thick or less as shown at b in fig  the inside walls  are preferably constructed of mild steel or alloy and are watercooled  the glass layer a next to the watercooled walls  is solidified and provides thermal insulation as well as corrosion protection the glass layer b on the gas side however is inviscid and flows freely down the side of the reactor under the influence of gravity and gas dynamic forces  refining basically pertains to the elimination of co and h o bubbles which form in the glass melt during the glass forming reactions during the suspension heat up of the batch materials the liberation of h o and co reduces the refining requirements of the glass formed along the vortex chamber walls the state of oxidation in the glass is an important factor in controlling the rate of refining with somewhat reducing conditions being preferred in conventional melting practice salt cake is often used as a refining agent which involves the liberation of so gas a flue gas pollutant in this invention the state of oxidation in the reactor can be accurately controlled to be slightly reducing thus enhancing the refining potential for reduced flint glass production the liberation of co and h o in suspension and the motion of the thin glass layer under gas dynamic and gravity forces enhances the refining process and provides a high degree of chemical and thermal homogeniety the refining section  of the reactor chamber is essentially a physical extension of the primary vortex section  the length of the refining section  impacts the glass residence time as well as temperature and can be used as a means of controlling the refining and homogenization process the rapid refining process makes it possible to minimize the size of the refining section  and helps to reduce the amount of the salt cake required for reduced flint glass production after passing down the length of the refining section  the rapidly refined and homogenized glass flow  passes into a reservoir  located at the bottom of the reactor where final refining and homogenization occurs the size of the reservoir can be adjusted to provide variations in residence time for the final refining process a stirrer not shown can be utilized in the reservoir if additional homogenization is required typical glass temperatures in the reservoir are in the range of ° f° f hot glass  exits the reservoir through a throat  and is distributed to forehearths not shown or other equipment for final processing flue gas  exits the reactor through a preferably watercooled exhaust duct  located above the reservoir  typical flue gas temperatures are in the range of ° f° f depending to a large extent on the melt temperture of the glass being produced preferably arrangements are made for delivering the existing flue gas  to a waste heat recovery system not shown cyclonetype vortex reactors an alternate embodiment of the vortex melting process is the incorporation into a horizontal tangentially fired cyclone melting system as shown in figs  and  in fig  gravity is shown in the negative z direction the primary process steps in this system are the preheating of class i and class ii glass batch materials a in a suspension preheater a the introduction andor preheating of class iii batch ingredients a a into injector assemblies a a the introduction of the resulting gas solid suspensions a and a into the cyclone vortex reactor a via injector assemblies a a the suspension preheating mixing and dispersion of the preheated batch ingredients to the side walls of the vortex suspension reactor section a of a cyclonetype vortex reactor a glass formation a along the reactor walls a by the coalescence mixing and reaction of batch ingredients the rapid homogenization and refining of the formed glass in a thin molten glass layer under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces and gravity within a reactor homogenization and refining section a a final refining and homogenization of the glass in a reservoir a and distribution of the flue gas via an exhaust gas duct a to a waste heat recovery system not shown the process sequences are basically the same as those for the toroidal vortex reacter with the following configurational or operational variations in a tangentially fired cyclone vortex reactor the primary fluid mechanical separation forces are produced by the tangential or secant injection a of the combustion products fuel oxidants and gassolid suspension into a cyclone chamber along its circumferential periphery the tangentially fired cyclone allows the use of a single injector assembly a as opposed to the plurality of injector assemblies which may be required with a toroidal vortex reactor an optional location for the class iii ingredient injector a is at the reactor forward wall as shown in fig  the nature of the vortex is also substantially different the cyclone produces a rankinetype vortex a as opposed to the hilltype vortex  produced in the toroidal reactor a plurality of injector and preheater assemblies can be adapted to the cyclone configuration however design simplicity suggests the use of a single preheater and injector flow train typical injector assemblies are injector nozzles with slot or channeltype ducts fig  positioned so that the injector jet a orientation is nearly tangent to the circular crosssection of the cyclone chamber the use of a single injector nozzle produces an asymmetric circumferential flow field within the cyclone chamber this flow field however is quickly smoothed out as the gas and particulates move down towards the rearward portion of the vortex reactor the circumferential homogeniety of the glass formed along the walls of the cyclone reaction will not be as uniform as with the toroidal reactor due to the asymmetric flow field and the horizontal orientation of the cyclone reactor which results in an asymmetric gravitational force acting on the molten glass layer the asymmetric gravity force produces a molten glass puddle a along the bottom of the cyclone reactor the increased thickness of the glass layer in the puddle a tends to reduce the effectiveness of the rapid refining and homogenization process within the cyclone reactor the rapid homogenization and refining section a of the cyclone reactor is not as clearly defined as with the toroidal vortex reactor in as much as particle deposition tends to take place along the entire length of the reactor a majority of the particle deposition however occurs in the primary separation zone a of the cyclone reactor the length of the rapid refining and homogenization section a can be increased to provide additional homogenization and refining time at the expense of increased wall heat transfer losses and pressure drop across the reactor this type of reator has demonstrated high levels of particle separation efficiency and hence may provide some system advantages in terms of reduced particulate carryover into any heat recovery system that is used in conjunction with the reactor in the horizontal cyclone reactor configuration a tap hole or drainage duct a is used to deliver the hot glass a to a reservoir a where final homogenization and refining occurs a stirrer not shown can be used to improve the homogeniety of the hot glass within the said distributorreservoir the refined and homogenized hot product glass exits the reservoir through a throat a from the reservoir the product glass a moves to forehearths or other process apparatus the flue gas exhaust duct a is preferably located above the glass puddle and can either be a tangential exit as shown a secant exit along the side wall or an exhaust hole at the end wall a of the reactor the combustion products a are preferably connected to a heat recovery system not shown the size and geometry of the final refining and homogenization reservoir can be adjusted to accommodate the variations in refining and homogenization requirements for different types of glass being produced additional embodiments of the vortex melting process can be adapted to other configurations of tangentially fired cyclonetype vortex reactors these other configurations include the vertical downflow cyclone reactor shown in fig  and the vertical reverse flow cyclone reactor shown in fig  in the vertical cyclone orientations shown in figs  and  the force of gravity on the molten glass layer is symmetrical with respect to the circumferential position within the reactor thus providing a more uniform molten glass layer b c along the sidewalls of the reactor and eliminating the puddle a which develops in horizontal cyclone reactors in a vertical downflow cyclone reactor shown in fig  the gaseous products fuel oxidant and combustion products and batch ingredients b are introduced near the top of the reactor and both are withdrawn near the bottom of the reactor in the vertical configuration the final homogenization and refining reservoir b is located at the bottom of the reactor b and the flue gas distributor duct b is located above the reservoir as in the case of the toroidal vortex reactor in the reverse flow vertical cyclone reactor shown in fig  the gaseous products and batch ingredients c are introduced near the top of the reactor and the molten glass c exits at the bottom c of the cyclone reactor similar to the previously described vertical downflow cyclone reactor the gas flow however reverses direction near the bottom of the reactor in zone c and exits the reactor in a vortex core c through the exhaust duct c located at the top of the cyclone reactor chamber as in the previous process concepts it is preferred that the flue gas c be connected to a waste heat recovery system and that the hot product glass c be delivered to forehearths or other process apparatus still another embodiment of the vortex melting process is shown in fig  as it relates to a vertical downflow axial swirl cyclonetype vortex reactor the primary process steps applied to this system are the preheating of class i and class ii batch materials in a suspension preheater a the introduction of class iii batch ingredients d into an injector assembly d the suspension preheating and mixing of the glass batch ingredients in the primary separation and reaction section d of the cyclone reactor d with glass formation d taking place along the side walls of the reactor vessel rapid homogenization and refining of the formed glass in a molten glass layer under the influence of gas dynamic shear forces and gravity within a reactor homogenization and refining section d final refining and homogenization of the molten glass in a reservoir d and distribution of the flue gas via an exhaust duct d to a waste heat recovery system not shown in an axial swirl cyclone reactor the primary fluid mechanically induced centrifugal separation forces are produced by the injection of the fuel oxidant combustion products and gassolids suspension into the cyclone reactor by a swirlvane injector assembly d located at the top wall of the reactor d the swirlvane assembly d can be segmented to permit the separate injection of class i ii and iii batch ingredients into the reactor the class i and ii batch ingredients are preheated in a suspension preheater a as previously discussed the preheated gassolids suspension d is then either mixed with the class iii batch ingredients in a common swirlvane assembly or injected separately into the cyclone reactor and mixed therein the embodiment in fig  shows mixing of the preheated class i and ii suspension d and the class iii batch d in the injector assembly d prior to injection of the mixed gassolid suspension d provisions for oxidant d and fuel injection d can be included in the swirlvane assembly design to allow for additional heat release and stoichiometry control within the reactor as previously discussed fig  shows an alternative swirlvane assemby which allows separate injection of the first gassolid suspension e which contains class i and ii batch ingredients the class iii batch ingredients e the oxidant e and the fuel e the nature of the vortex produced by an axial swirl cyclone reactor is significantly different from that produced by tangentially driven cyclone reactors in that strong secondary recirculation zones are located near the swirlvane assembly the vortex flow field d fig  and e fig  is more three dimensional in nature than the vortex produced by a tangentially drive cyclone and particle separation tends to be more localized at the head or top end of the vortex reactor thus the primary vortex separation and reaction section of the axial swirl cyclone d and the rapid homogenization and refining section of the reactor d tend to be more discretely defined than in tangentially driven cyclone reactors another advantage of the axial swirl cyclone reactor design over the tangential cyclone reactor configuration is the circumferential uniformity of the vortex flow field which is produced this flow field tends to provide a uniform circumferential distribution of batch ingredients along the cyclone reactor side walls thus enhancing the homogeniety of the glass which is formed a disadvantage of the axial swirl cyclone reactor is the reduced separation efficiency for a fixed pressure drop relative to the tangentially fired cyclone in addition the construction materials and potential plugging problems can reduce the operating temperature range of this type vortex reactor in comparison to toroidal reactors and tangentially driven cyclone reactors as with the other vertical cyclone reactors the symmetrical gravity force tends to produce a circumferentially uniform glass layer d along the side walls of the reactor the reservoir d where final homogenization and refining occur is located at the bottom of the reactor the hot glass d exits the reservoir d through a throat d and preferably structure is provided for delivering the hot product glass d to forehearths or other glass making apparatus the flue gas exhaust duct d is preferably located above the reservoir d along the reactor sidewall the flue gas d is preferably delivered to a waste heat recovery system not shown a horizontal axial swirl cyclone reactor not shown can also be adapted to the vortex melting process a suspension preheater similar to preheater a shown in fig  and injector designs d or e as shown in figs  and injector design and gassolids flow patterns d and e in the vortex region will be similar to that shown in fig  and  however the horizontal orientation results in the formation of a puddle of molten glass on the bottom of the vortex reactor similar to that shown in fig  and similar reactor design changes as shown in fig  are necessary for reorientation of the exit duct similar a and the distributorreservoir  as was described for the horizontal tangentially driven cyclone hybrid combinations of axial swirl and tangentially driven cyclone reactors in conjunction with variations in flow patterns such as downflow reverse flow and tangential exit reactors can also be adapted to the vortex melting process these variations will not
