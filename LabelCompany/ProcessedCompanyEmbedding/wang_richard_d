feb  my daughter has been seeing him for removal of impacted tooth and implant he is very friendly and explains everything and his office staff are very helpful too john e schappert in hamilton va  jan  dr wang by my experiences with him is top notch i have had an extraction and several implants and he has been excellent he tells you what he is going to do and then performs the oral surgery making sure you are not in pain he also has a good sense of humor and personality no matter what questions i have asked he always gives me concise answers he spent much time with my regular dentist in consultation so they were both on the same page thank you dr wang jess smith in woodbridge va  oct  this practice was great i called to move my appointment up and they called back to offer me a cancellation spot dr wang was very good as well as the nurses definitely would recommend this practice to othersjohn in fredericksburg va  oct  i was quite anxious about having a surgical extraction and the sleep meds because of my problems with hbp anxiety atttacks and sleep apnea dr wang and his staff took excellent care of me and i truly appreciate all of their efforts to keep me comfortable throughout the process i felt completely fine when i came too and was told there were no complications while i was under this is a credit to their knowledge expertise and experience thanks again to everyone who got me through thisashwitha shetty in herndon va  sep  got my husbands wisdom tooth extraction done here last month was satisfied with the doctors work he seemed sweet and understanding even the assistant was a very sweet lady but the biggest turn off was the receptionist who was this older lady who reeked of arrogance there were some clarifications to be done on the insurance instead of being helpful and trying and sorting the issue she made rude faces and kept rolling her eye had a terrible experience would nvr wnt to see her face againreston va  jul  i recently got my wisdom teeth out and immediately regretted it im  years old and only brought my dad so he could drive me home but they decided that instead of giving me all of my needed paperwork and post op treatments they gave it to him and didnt explain to me what to do and not to do after surgery so i ended up with insanely painful dry socket the women at the front desk is beyond rude and was no help whatsoever overall dont recommend anyone to go there washington dc  jan  ive seen dr wang on two occasions i appreciate how they have made time for me both times however the main office woman is consistently rude without merit and id honestly rather not go just to avoid her confrontational attitude more commentshave you seen dr richard wang ddsleave a revieware you dr wangmake it easy for
