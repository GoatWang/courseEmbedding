mynfo inc an innovative new media platform for marketers and consumers announced today it has closed  million in series a financing led by almaz capital ross hangebrauck almaz capital managing director will join the mynfo board of directors the mynfo platform will launch this year in two top  media markets funds from the investment will be used to scale the platform to additional markets throughout the us“marketers spend billions of dollars every year trying to understand and influence millions of consumers through advertising distributed on television online and mobile networks yet an increasing number of those same consumers are choosing adfree content” said susan o’neal gear mynfo’s founder and ceo “consumers don’t hate advertising they dislike how the advertising is distributed”the broadcast media model first introduced in the 4’s was an efficient way to create brand equity because consumers had fewer content choices today technology has not only given consumers more choice about what content they consume they can also choose whether or not advertising is going to be part of the experience as a result media models built on the over seventy year old concept of impressions have lost value both to marketers and consumers according to an april  report by accenture 4 of digital consumers complain that advertising too frequently interrupts their content consumption 4 plan to remove these interruptions either via paid subscription or ad blocking software in the next twelve months frustration is even higher among younger consumers “consumers don’t want to be targets they want and expect to be valued partners” explained gear new mynfo board member hangebrauck concurs adding “we have been actively investing in entrepreneurs and startups that bring a unique competitive advantage to this sector mynfo has identified and addressed an important need for consumers and marketers alike and developed a platform that will deliver real value to both” gear’s passion for mynfo and its mission of transforming the consumer to marketer relationship is shared by her cofounders former quotient executive shachar “shock” torem serving as chief client officer and veteran startup technologist marvin scaff serving as chief technology officer about mynfoat mynfo we believe that every moment of every life has value honoring that truth creates a unique opportunity

experiences in the twentyfirst century we transform native mobile game advertising like banners and popups that distract from gameplay into engaging valuepacked experiences for end users and revenuegenerating opportunities for advertisers and developers with the power of adjoy we make ads feel less like ads and more like an integral interactive part of gameplay  because that’s exactly what they are our selfservice ad platform makes it possible to embed daily deals promotions and coupons into things like checkpoints powerups enemies and other collectible objects that function as part of native gameplay it’s our philosophy that mobile games should be fun free to play and actually reward the end user while ensuring developers benefit economically without having to sacrifice those fundamental values for their users  and that’s exactly what adjoy delivers read on to discover how adjoy is completely revolutionizing the mobile games industry by creating an all new standard in interactivebased monetization banner ads detract from a game’s intellectual property as a result they’re often only an option for the most simplistic games from indie developers video based reward ads are currently one successful alternative but these ads still remove the user from the immersive gaming experience popup ads… well what else is there to say about popups other than that everyone knows they’re the worst the bottom line current methods of advertising in video games are all extremely frustrating to the end user and this directly contributes to the roi advertisers see  or rather don’t see  on mobile game ads things have gotten so bleak that the only ads that advertisers are actually willing to spend money on in mobile games is other mobile games anything else like retail products that users actually want continually fall flat and drive away users the big takeaway users aren’t having fun  they’re losing interest advertisers are losing roi game developers are losing value in their intellectual property adjoy is on a quest to make monetization for game developers a much better experience a positive experience that carriers over to the gamers who are able to enjoy games while still being advertised to in a noninvasive yet much more effective way adjoy isn’t some farfetched idea about the future of mobile gaming and advertising we’ve already successful proven our concept with our working prototype the lowest cost per install when marketing our games we have only had to spend on average  per user install this means for every  users advertisers are only spending a marketing budget of around  this is nearly unheard of as the usual cost is closer to  per install with other games   user retention rates skyrocket one of our games jumped from a th day user retention rate average amount of people who still have the game download after  days of  to a whopping 4 once adjoy offers and rewards were enabled in the game 4 is huge major companies only get about  retention rate for even the gold standard of games users love the experience of winning real world prizes and they show it by going back for more and more rewards proven to drive traffic on average about  of the offers distributed in adjoy are redeemed this number might not sound high but it is revolutionary to any marketer who knows typical redemption rates are usually a paltry  with proven stats like this choosing adjoy for your mobile game advertising is a nobrainer because games are traditionally developed using numerous tools and development environments creating an api that allows any third party designer to build a game using our tech would normally pose some difficulties developers can now simply point and choose objects in their game wrap an image or logo around it and instantly make it an ingame ad that the user is able to interact with when the user interacts with the object during gameplay a coupon is distributed from the advertiser directly into the user’s digital wallet when the user is done playing they go to the wallet screen of the game view their outstanding offers select one and are guided to the participating redemption location via googleapple maps the user then receives even more ingame rewards for redeeming their coupon such as gems which can be spent on powerups thus perpetuating gameplay incentive and engagement our mvp was with  advertisers in redding california their ads were geographically placed within a game we made called “piggy bankz” we will be launching out of our private beta shortly during this time we’ve put together two amazing testimonial videos on our website one featuring a local papa johns owner and another featuring the owner of rare air a trampoline park note that these are the business owners ie the advertisers who target our users we are currently developing our advertiser network in sacramento we have  advertiser presignups for the area to whom we will give a onemonth free trial these advertisers represent pipelined revenue of  to  we should be able to convert them to paying customers by midlate november a significant portion of our gotomarket strategy involves partnerships we will target partnerships with companies such as yelp to white label our ad portal and get in front of established local advertiser platforms we have already established a relationship with yelp’s head of business development and he wants to integrate our platform once it is live gamifying advertising is the future we are currently launching our advertising platform in the simplest form possible –

round with an investment from local investment group shasta angels adjoy is raising a total of  and the fundraising round potentially values the company at  million although because adjoy is in an early stage of development investors have chosen to delay a firm valuation until a later more robust investment in the company can be made led by a team of ambitious entrepreneurs adjoy has set its sights on a lofty goal – removing banner ads from mobile games entirely instead of banners adjoy wants to see a world of ingame advertising where game objects become collectable real world coupons based in redding adjoy currently operates out of the shasta venture hub an incubator for emerging startups in the redding area the hub is excited to have adjoy as one of their resident companies “they are taking advertising that was once bothersome and turning it into something that is engaging and beneficial” says hope seth who is the marketing and entrepreneurial development director of the venture hub currently adjoy is in the production phase of building a suite of developer tools which will allow any unity d developer to select ingame objects to become adjoy enabled doing so will be a huge benefit to indie and midrange game studios who put up with banner ads as a way to pay their bills adjoy offers a competitive monetization platform that promises to enhance gameplay instead of detract from it as banner ads often do adjoy is aggressively pursuing a market release of their minimal viable product which they hope to see active in the sacramento area by the end of september  the private beta will give adjoy real world traction and help them hone in on user behavior as well as collect key metrics they will need as they integrate their software with much larger development
