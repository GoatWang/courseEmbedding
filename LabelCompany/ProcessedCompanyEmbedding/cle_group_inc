controversialclick for more for the past several years asset protection has been one of the fastest growing areas of law asset protection is also one of the most controversial because the goal is to shield assets from the reach of creditors asset protection should simply be about structuring the ownership of ones assets to safeguard them from potential future risks most asset protection structures are commonly used business and estate planning tools  such as limited liability companies family limited partnerships trusts and the like properly implemented asset protection planning should be legal and ethical it should not be based on hiding assets or on secrecy it is not a means or an excuse to avoid or evade u s taxes there is no one magic bullet in asset protection and the term asset protection encompasses a number of planning and structuring mechanisms that may be implemented by a practitioner to minimize a clients exposure to risk for each client the asset protection solution will be different depending on the identity of the debtor the nature of the claim the identity of the creditor and the nature of the assets these are four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case the analysis of these four factors determines what planning would be possible and effective for a specific client join jacob stein as he

to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion it is usually impossibleclick for more the goal of all asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion it is usually impossible to completely and absolutely protect assets and the focus is on making assets more difficult and more expensive to reach all asset protection planning is based on two principle premises creditors can generally reach any asset owned by a debtor and creditors cannot reach those assets that the debtor does not own in this obvious dichotomy trusts come to the rescue by splitting the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership this is the main reason that trusts are widely used in asset protection not all types of trusts are effective asset protection devices but a properly drafted and structured trust may be an almost impregnable form of asset protection if you would like to learn more about how trusts are used in advanced asset planning and protection please join jacob stein as he provides a thorough and practical overview of this important topic mr stein mainly discusses trusts specific

the past several years asset protection has been one of the fastest growing areas of law asset protection is also one of the most controversial because the goal is to shield assets from the reach of creditors asset protection should simply be about structuring the ownership of ones assets to safeguard them from potential future risks most asset protection structures are commonly used business and estate planning tools  such as limited liability companies family limited partnerships trusts and the like properly implemented asset protection planning should be legal and ethical it should not be based on hiding assets or on secrecy it is not a means or an excuse to avoid or evade u s taxes there is no one magic bullet in asset protection and the term asset protection encompasses a number of planning and structuring mechanisms that may be implemented by a practitioner to minimize a clients exposure to risk for each client the asset protection solution will be different depending on the identity of the debtor the nature of the claim the identity of the creditor and the nature of the assets these are four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset

evasion it is usually impossible to completely and absolutely protect assets and the focus is on making assets more difficult and more expensive to reach all asset protection planning is based on two principle premises creditors can generally reach any asset owned by a debtor and creditors cannot reach those assets that the debtor does not own in this obvious dichotomy trusts come to the rescue by splitting the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership this is the main reason that trusts are widely used in asset protection not all types of trusts are effective asset
