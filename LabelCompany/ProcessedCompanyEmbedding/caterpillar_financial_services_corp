manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime

federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty

permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all

states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for

caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness caterpillar company formed edit a horsepower caterpillar sixty being used for road work in the cibola national forest new mexico united states in  the banks who held the companys large debt forced the holt board of directors to accept their candidate thomas a baxter to succeed benjamin holt baxter initially cut the large tractors from the companys product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the caterpillar tractor co the new company was headquartered in san leandro until  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to peoria baxter had been removed as ceo earlier in  and clarence leo

a sharp downturn in product demand as competition with japanese rival komatsu increased at the time komatsu used the internal slogan encircle caterpillar caterpillar suffered further when the united states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for  months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in  caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  to  per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of  that was paid to workers at deere  company in  during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry analysts caterpillar began to execute a southern strategy this involved opening new smaller plants termed focus facilities in righttowork states caterpillar opened these new facilities in clayton and sanford north carolina greenville south carolina corinth mississippi dyersburg tennessee griffin and lagrange georgia seguin texas and north little rock arkansas in  the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in london ontario canada and demanded some accept up to a  cut in pay in order to become costcompetitive with comparable caterpillar manufacturing facilities in the united states

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal

reading  external links historyedit main article holt manufacturing company benjamin holt one of the founding fathers of holt manufacturing company originsedit the steam tractors of the s and early s were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness caterpillar company formed edit a horsepower caterpillar sixty being used for road work in the cibola national forest new mexico united states in  the banks who held the companys large debt forced the holt board of directors to accept their candidate thomas a baxter to succeed benjamin holt baxter initially cut the large tractors from the companys product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the caterpillar tractor co the new company was headquartered in san leandro until  when under the terms of the merger it was moved to peoria baxter had been removed as ceo earlier in  and clarence leo

states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for  months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in  caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  to  per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of  that was paid to workers at deere  company in  during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry analysts caterpillar began to execute a southern strategy this involved opening new smaller plants termed focus facilities in righttowork states caterpillar opened these new facilities in clayton and sanford north carolina greenville south carolina corinth mississippi dyersburg tennessee griffin and lagrange georgia seguin texas and north little rock arkansas in  the company locked out workers at a locomotive plant in london ontario canada and demanded some accept up to a  cut in pay in order to become costcompetitive with comparable caterpillar manufacturing facilities in the united states

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of

were extremely heavy sometimes weighing  pounds  kg per horsepower and often sank into the rich soft earth of the san joaquin valley delta farmland surrounding stockton california benjamin holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to  feet  m tall and  feet  m wide producing a tractor  feet  m wide but this also made the tractors increasingly complex expensive and difficult to maintain two holt  gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the mojave desert during construction of the los angeles aqueduct in  another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor but this was timeconsuming expensive and interfered with earthmoving holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels he replaced the wheels on a  horsepower  kw holt steamer no  with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains on thanksgiving day november   he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of roberts island company photographer charles clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar and holt seized on the metaphor caterpillar it is thats the name for it some sources though attribute this name to british soldiers in july  two years later holt sold his first steampowered tractor crawlers for us about us today each side featured a track frame measured  inches  mm high by  inches  mm wide and were  feet  m long the tracks were  inches  mm by  inches  mm redwood slats holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on december   for his improved traction engine improvement in vehicles and especially of the traction engine class and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried move to peoriaedit a postcard showing the caterpillar tractor co plant in peoria period – on february   holt opened up a plant in east peoria illinois led by his nephew pliny holt there pliny met farm implement dealer murray baker who knew of an empty factory that had been recently built to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines baker who later became the first executive vice president of what became caterpillar tractor company wrote to holt headquarters in stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt colean manufacturing co of east peoria illinois on october   pliny holt purchased the factory and immediately began operations with  employees holt incorporated it as the holt caterpillar company although he did not trademark the name caterpillar until august   the addition of a plant in the midwest despite the hefty capital needed to retool the plant proved so profitable that only two years later the company employed  people and was exporting tractors to argentina canada and mexico tractors were built in both stockton and east peoria on january   after more than  years of being headquartered in peoria illinois the company announced plans to move their headquarters from peoria to chicago illinois by the end of  the upper echelon of executives including newly installed ceo jim umpleby will begin relocating later this year with up to  employees total moving by years end about  employees will work in the new office at an asyet undecided location once the transition is complete the company indefinitely suspended planning for the new peoria headquarters in the fall of  after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to  jobs to be cut and about  facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated the changes contributed to  billion in savings in  but sales and revenue for last year still were more than  percent below peak levels of  umpleby said that decline is a fundamental reason the companys board of directors opted to move global headquarters to an area where the global marketplace is in easier reach use in world war iedit holts tracktype tractors played a support role in world war i even before the us formally entered wwi holt had shipped  tractors to england france and russia for agricultural purposes these governments however sent the tractors directly to the battlefront where the military put them to work hauling artillery and supplies when world war i broke out the british war office ordered a holt tractor and put it through trials at aldershot the war office was suitably impressed and chose it as a guntractor over the next four years the holt tractor became a major artillery tractor mainly used to haul medium guns like the inch howitzer the pounder and later the inch howitzer holt tractors were also the inspiration for the development of the british tank which profoundly altered ground warfare tactics major ernest swinton sent to france as an army war correspondent very soon saw the potential of a tracklaying tractor although the british later chose an english firm to build its first tanks the holt tractor became one of the most important military vehicles of all time a caterpillar d introduced in  at the serpentine vintage tractor museum serpentine western australia postwar challengesedit holt tractors had become well known during world war i military contracts formed the major part of the companys production when the war ended holts planned expansion to meet the militarys needs was abruptly terminated the heavyduty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers the companys situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from europe depressing prices for new equipment and holts unsold inventory of military tractors the company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust to keep the company afloat they borrowed heavily c l best gas tractor company formed by clarence leo best in  and holts primary competitor had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed as a result best had gained a considerable market advantage over holt by wars end best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion especially production of its new best model  tracklayer both companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy which contributed to a nationwide depression further inhibiting sales on december   yearold benjamin holt died after a monthlong illness

on the agricultural market when the federal aid highway act of  funded a us billion federal highway building program baxter began refocusing the company towards building road construction equipment both companies also faced fierce competition from the fordson company between  and  best and holt had spent about us million in legal fees fighting each other in a number of contractual trademark and patent infringement lawsuits harry h fair of the bond brokerage house of pierce fair  company of san francisco had helped to finance c l bests debt and holt shareholders approached him about their companys financial difficulty fair recommended that the two companies should merge in april and may  the financially stronger c l best merged with the market leader holt caterpillar to form the

states declared an embargo against the soviet union after the soviet invasion of afghanistan causing the company to be unable to sell us million worth of pipelaying machinery that had already been built due to the drastic drop in demand caterpillar initiated employee layoffs which led to strikes primarily by the members of the united auto workers against caterpillar facilities in illinois and pennsylvania several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations in  the united auto workers conducted a fivemonth strike against caterpillar in response caterpillar threatened to replace caterpillars entire unionized work force over ten thousand uaw members struck again in – for  months a record at that time the strike ended with the uaw deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by caterpillar in  caterpillar offered a contract to the uaw members that would have raised the salary of top workers from  to  per year however the uaw was seeking the same top wage of  that was paid to workers at deere  company in  during the strikes caterpillar used management employees in an attempt to maintain production it suspended research and development work sending thousands of engineers and other nonbargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members rather than continuing to fight the united auto workers caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor one way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms in another move according to uaw officials and industry

justice department and the state of california after governmental investigations revealed violations of the clean air act the violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with defeat devices devices that regulated emissions during presale tests but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving consequently these engines emit up to triple the permissible level of smogforming nitrogen oxides nox in  alone these violating vehicles emitted  million tons of additional nox — an amount equal to the emissions of  million cars for this reason caterpillar was named the clean air villain of the month for august  by the clean air trust the consent decree provided that  million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards caterpillar however was successful in lobbying for an extension of deadlines they considered too severe even so in october  caterpillar – the only diesel engine company of those that signed decrees to fail to meet the new emissions standards deadline – was forced to pay  million in perengine nonconformance penalties tax deferral techniquesedit in march  when us federal agents raided caterpillars headquarters in peoria ill it was already evident that the company engaged in aggressive measures to control tax costs since april  the companys tax policies have been

until the end of construction and rampup to full capacity with the exception of mining projects where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project projects must have a a start date b estimate for completion c initial investment estimate data for stateowned projects initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts along with addendums and annexes if original contracts cannot be obtained information is taken from public documents presentations news articles from bnamericas archives and external sources in cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval in the case of private projects information is taken from public sources such as stock exchange filings annual reports company presentations third party research and press releases in judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source the greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a likeforlike comparison in project costs insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature no attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money validation in the case of stateowned projects validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium epc contractor a relevant state agency or advisors to either party currency projects costs are measured in us dollars where project costs are measured in a local currency amounts are converted to us dollars at the date of the relevant announcement signature or report severity of deviation from original estimates the severity of deviation

success technology helps excavating contractor meet tight tolerances excavation is a precise business tolerances are tight many times inch or less to be successful contractors must utilize machines equipped to efficiently meet projects specs with no rework tec inc tatum excavating company texarkana texas utilizes cat® machines and services to help meet demanding tolerances and better measure machine operation and efficiency a cat m motor grader was purchased recently in part because the blade position is automatically controlled to help the operator meet each project’s exacting grade specifications utilization of a gps grade control system greatly improves the m’s accuracy and efficiency with the technology grade stakes are eliminated and fewer passes are needed to achieve target specifications sensors provide realtime blade position which is compared to a threedimensional electronic site plan the hydraulic system and operator are signaled to raise or lower the blade to achieve design requirements the m as well as a dk and a dk dozer used the gps grade control system for site prep work at a foot expansion of an existing rail spur in pittsburgh texas tec inc duties at the job included construction of  feet of new rail spur associated drainage earthwork ditches the installation of riprap as well as reconstruction of a section of existing rail “on another project we were running  grade tolerance on a onemile road a slipform paver came in right behind the m” says ross sarine vice president “it doesn’t get any better than that” high uptime the company has utilized s•o•ssm fluids sampling for the past  years to help keep its fleet operating at peak performance fluid sampling accurately charts machine performance prevents minor problems from escalating and keeps uptime high “when a component is out of spec we can immediately diagnose the source of the problem before we have a catastrophic failure” sarine says “or it can be as simple as an engine oil fuel cap not sealing properly and it’s letting dust in it gives us a heads up that the naked eye would never catch”  tec measures machine operation cost per hour including repairs and service costs to be sure that machines are working efficiently tracking costs tec inc management knows with certainty that the  cat machines the company owns are the least expensive to own and operate per hour compared to other brands in its mixed fleet “we code all repairs and operational expenses to each machine historically cat machines perform much better in longterm owning and operating costs than other brands cat machines have fewer repairs and better uptime” sarine says he cited a dk dozer purchased in  as an example of the highquality lowmaintenance cat machines in the company’s fleet “the dk had its first system  undercarriage replaced at  hours that’s a huge cost advantage  we replace undercarriages for other brands at  hours” sarine says the rotating bushings in the dozer’s undercarriage increase the component’s life in the highly abrasive sandy environment in which the machine works the dk’s high uptime and long life were key factors in the company’s decision to purchase a dk dozer in  helping hands outstanding support from caterpillar and their local dealer holt cat are important factors when purchasing new machines “having machines working on the job every day is essential the dealer provides the support to help us meet demanding schedules” sarine says “we use holt cat for key repairs and field service even some inshop repairs and service” parts delivery also keeps uptime high “caterpillar has without question the best parts network we can order a part and have it the same day or next morning cat support is ” sarine says tec inc uses its own machines approximately  percent of the time and rents a specialty piece or an additional piece from holt cat to supplement the fleet “that’s when we look to our cat dealer” sarine says “we commonly rent support equipment like compactors we also rent specialty equipment like longreach excavators that we don’t keep in the fleet” in a field where precision is of the utmost importance tec inc has built a reputation for highquality workmanship outstanding production and customer satisfaction “that’s what keeps customers coming back” sarine says tec inc completed construction of the first section of the rail spur in pittsburgh texas more than a decade ago the company was hired to do site prep for the update because the customer remembered the contractor’s skill precision and efficiency that is a legacy that would

product cat  gamechanging technology delivers confidence and cost savings  caterpillar gamechanging technology delivers confidence and cost savings don taylor project manager at mcaninch corp an iowa highway utility and heavy construction firm has seen some big breakthroughs in his day—from cable to hydraulics to gps now he’s ready to add another one to the list machine drive power mdp “it’s a gamechanger” he says mdp is a machineintegrated soil compaction measurement technology that evaluates rolling resistance that resistance provides an indication of soil stiffness and loadbearing strength—and whether compaction is adequate to hold the road parking lot building or whatever is planned for a site this proprietary technology is catching the attention of contractors because it works on all soil types including cohesives and can enable a compactor to act as a proof roller even when not vibrating plus mdp can eliminate the need for multiple passes of a compactor and deliver considerable cost savings in altoona iowa mcaninch is putting mdp to the test to determine proactively if compaction is adequate to support a new onoff ramp structure operators inside the mdpequipped cat® csb soil compactor can view realtime results on a monitor in the cab a green area on the display means the area was covered and targets were met a red area indicates troublespots and alerts the operator to make adjustments here’s an example realizing that one red area likely resulted from too much moisture one of mcaninch’s operators switched from the compactor to a tractor and disk and spent about  minutes turning the soil so it would dry more quickly then he took another pass with the csb and the screen turned green “it gives you confidence that you’ve reached density and can move on” taylor says he and others testing mdp say it is a more accurate indicator of stiffness and loadbearing strength than anything they have seen to date perhaps in part because of the high clay content of the iowa soil—though it works well in other materials too “you can add a lot of road life with uniformity” taylor says “states spend a lot of their transportation money on maintenance if the base has no weaknesses you’ll only have to replace a wear course from time to time that is a huge cost savings at a time when every dime is being watched” mcaninch estimates a  percent savings on pass count and a  percent reduction in testing costs using mdp on this project even better there was zero rework—because the company was able to identify potential problems while the base was still open “you can’t leave technology like this on the shelf” taylor says “you would have better measurements and better roads at a lower cost those are tough points to argue” cat® machine drive power cat

testing caterpillar technology for vessel monitoring  diagnostics  caterpillar engine product  service announcements crowley maritime testing caterpillar technology for vessel monitoring  diagnostics houston tx – calling it “the next logical step in marine technology” crowley maritime corporation is installing cat® asset intelligence software on one of its vessels the tugboat guide a shipassist vessel operating out of seattle is being fitted with a custom vessel monitoring and diagnostics solution which will keep watch over its main engines generators thrusters and critcal systems   while completely automated from data capture through analysis and advisory recommendations for each piece of equipment the caterpillar marine asset intelligence team will provide advisory and management reports including recommendations for individual equipment as well as additional ways crowley can save money and incrementaly improve operations “it’s a robust system that does all the key monitoring and analysis we need” said bill metcalf vice president of strategic engineering for crowley maritime “we’re looking at it as the next level of management and optimization and we want to see how it can help us increase reliability safety and efficiency onboard our vessels” unlike technologies that only monitor engine performance cat® asset intelligence services provide monitoring and diagnostics for an entire vessel including many of its critical operating systems dedicated fleet advisors then use the aggregated data and automated analytics to provide customers such as crowley with actionable advisories to increase vessel productivity and improve equipment management “it’s very scalable and customizable that’s one of the things we liked about this technology” metcalf said “plus cat® asset intelligence will monitor and analyze anything—not just cat® products that was a big selling point as we like many others have a wide variety of equipment that is critical to our success” with the software monitoring and analyzing guide’s key systems crowley maritime expects to see value in a number of areas “it can give us early warning of a catastrophic failure so we can schedule maintenance it can save us time and money during the inspection process it can help us keep our vessels and people out of harm’s way” metcalf said “we’re also looking at fuel savings that’s not likely to be a big issue on guide because of its size and application but it could be huge for our larger vessels” on smaller vessels like guide which operate with a limited crew cat®asset intelligence software’s remote monitoring capabilities play a critical role “guide is a fourman boat which means the chief engineer also serves as a deckhand when he’s on duty” metcalf said “this technology will make his job easier and as its accessable for our engineering staff adding  another set of eyes on the vessel another level of comfort for the captain and operations team”  crowley maritime has established a governance committee to analyze the software’s performance onboard guide and if it proves valuable hopes to expand vessel monitoring and diagnostics to other ships in its fleet “we consider crowley maritime an important partner and we’re working through the cat® asset intelligence journey together” said leslie bellfriedel global business manager for caterpillar marine asset intelligence “there’s a real team mentality in place to ensure they get as much value from this technology as possible” metcalf is confident the addition of cat® asset intelligence technology will help crowley maritime maintain and enhance its reputation as a leader in the areas of safety reliability and efficiency “caterpillar has been a good partner with crowley for many years and they’ve been at this for a long time” he said “this process is in place in mines and factories it’s the next logical step in marine technology and we want to be early adopters if it adds value” about crowley maritime corporation crowley maritime
