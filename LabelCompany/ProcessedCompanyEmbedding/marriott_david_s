family’s hotel empire david marriott stresses community to carry on the marriott brand by  carlo wolff carlowolffgmailcom ashburn virginia—born to the hotel life david marriott fits right in at the springhill suites ashburn in this northern virginia suburb of washington dc in april marriott visited the property to pump up the troops shaking the hand of each member of a group of marriott associates gathered in the lobby of this fresh selectservice hotel the only building with an identifying sign in an area slowly becoming a new city center “i feel like i started with the company the day they put a diaper on me” the boyish scion of the storied marriott brand told the group seated in one of two circular “communal centers” in the lobby as coo of marriott international’s americas eastern region marriott  leads  hotels stretching from south carolina to maine to west virginia including  selectservice properties and  ritzcarltons as of that thursday  april he had been in the job for only  days as coo of marriott internationals americas eastern region david marriott makes it a point to greet the companys associates in person meeting the people “you’ve gone through a lot in the last  months” marriott said his communication easygoing his manner far more relaxed than his attire what’s key to success in hospitality he said is “genuine care for people” making sure family relationships are strong and “day in and day out you’re giving your all” he said marriott is in a good position as the world emerges from recession marriott also noted that his favorite destination is camelback inn resort  spa in scottsdale arizona the marriott spread where he and his family recently visited his father yearold jw bill marriott jr and bill’s wife donna bill marriott has spent  birthdays at the scottsdale landmark which is where david and his wife carey became engaged the youngest of four children marriott ran global sales for marriott for four years decentralizing the operation into regional sales offices until january when he assumed his new position still acclimating to the greater responsibilities he was leery about discussing whether he someday will take over for his father as leader of the company but the question is inevitable debbie marriott harrison the oldest child is senior vp of government affairs for marriott stephen the next oldest is executive vp of culture john runs jw marriott family enterprises that leaves david the one marriott other than bill with his hands—literally—on hotels in his talk with associates marriott said springhill suites is “beautifully positioned” for business in the downturn and later ritzcarlton had a really difficult  but is getting back on track the fullservice jw marriott brand is becoming more relevant to the business traveler and the timing was bad to debut edition and nickelodeon respectively a luxury boutique hotel and a family resort but he stressed the silver lining “we’ve had a lot of really good learnings in the last yearandahalf” marriott said predicting robust growth in india as well as china where marriott expects to open  hotels during the next two years there are  already there casual charisma in an interview after the gathering marriott said he spends his day on reports from vps responsible for ritzcarltons the cres courtyard and residence hotels and for larger markets including new york city where marriott will launch a renovation of the room marriott marquis at the end of the year other imminent renovations the room philadelphia marriott downtown and the room marriott copley place in boston marriott visits gms to “talk through their challenges” and attempts to make sure owners are “investing in the product and staying on top of their renovation schedules” the hardest thing about the new job “finding the appropriate balance to pay attention to the competing priorities” issuing from customers associates owners and ownership groups “i’m still learning about the job” did he want the job “absolutely” he said “whenever you go into a big job it feels overwhelming at times but it’s a tremendous opportunity and i’m really enjoying it so far” he called his management style “really collaborative if you ask my team they would say i’m always looking for ideas and trying to create an environment where there’s a free flow of ideas”  early in his new post he organized a twoday retreat with an outside facilitator “to talk about what makes a highperforming team and what our priorities would be” trust was a hot topic it’s not always easy to share things with your boss particularly when the boss has the last name of marriott david marriott shares thoughts about hotels with marriott associates ‘extended family’ while no member of the marriott family would comment on david his boss did “his brother john introduced me to him when he was still in college” recalled david grissen president of the americas marriott international “he handles himself extremely well given he’s a younger guy when i tour hotels with him it’s kind of fun … he’s just charming with the associates he’s kind of iconic you walk in the place is abuzz the hourly staff the housekeepers the line staff in the kitchen they just pop to attention “we’re kind of unique in the industry in that we have someone with their name on the building walk into the hotel there isn’t a mr starwood and the hiltons are kind of gone” is it uncomfortable being his boss “there’s no downside” grissen said “the biggest downside would be if mr marriott found out i didn’t give david constructive feedback and criticism that’s when he might decide to find a new president of the americas” david hasn’t had a development or finance role in the company or as much operations experience as some other marriott executives grissen suggested so he needs “exposure to the right areas” he has conversations in which he asks david to list “three things that you go home and lose sleep over because you don’t know” then work on them “he’s going to build out his experience and credibility and business skills” grissen said “but the one thing i think he’s a natural at it is a leader he’s wonderful on stage he’s got great platform skills … he’s genuine he’s articulate he speaks well and he speaks from the heart” david “is a very normal guy” grissen said “he’s got a very balanced head on his shoulders for someone who grew up in the marriott family you could end up very different not a rollupyoursleeves kind of person he truly appreciates a lot of what we’ve built as a company from a culture standpoint—our associates mean a lot to us and he gets that” associates view their coworkers as “extended family” marriott said “i think it’s critical particularly now that that culture continues to grow and be strong you look at our turnover it’s extremely low look at our tenure it’s extremely high our gms are generally  to year associates with the company and the number of executives we have that are plus years is unheard of “there’s a lot of people unemployed right now more than in years” he said “we want to make sure we hold on to the best talent and attract the best talent make sure the people we hire have a passion for this industry” a field of hard work and long hours   “i’ve always believed you live in the moment and do the best you can with what you have on your plate” marriott said “if you do that the other things will take care of themselves if my family life isn’t successful and happy to me the rest of it who really cares” known as a huge grateful dead fan marriott abandons his blackberry on weekends “it’s all about the kids when i’m not working and it’s all about my wife trying to carve out a couple of hours a week for ourselves” no comments ronna l stephens may    am david

at his fathers company is the only one of the four marriott children who works in daytoday operations for their fathers company by ricky carioti  the washington post toolbox resize print email reprints by michael s rosenwald washington post staff writer monday october   there are moments for many parents when they look at their children and see themselves it happened to bill marriott a few weeks ago during breakfast in tokyo the hotel magnate now  and slower with his steps but not his drive was in japan with his youngest son david who is  and the head of global sales at the bethesda company that shares their last name they were meeting the local sales team david was a few minutes late so his father got things started bill marriott is famous for his folksy touch with his frontline employees but that morning uncharacteristically he went around the table very businesslike pressing the sales crew for details on their deals the employees were tense bill marriott could feel it then in walks david being mr funny cracking jokes asking about their families in a minute and a half everyone was laughing and feeling good bill marriott said and it got them all talking it was telling to me it was what i should have done and what i normally do its one thing for a parent to feel joy in spotting a likeness in a child but quite another thing to do so in the context of a  billion company when the largest shareholder is ones family more complications develop when dad is  and what people want to ask but fear doing so is who comes after you reading the tea leaves becomes something of a sport around the office its a fact of life for the marriotts that will loom larger as david radically reorganizes group and corporate bookings moving sales reps out of individual hotels and into regional centers though it may sound bureaucratic no one else does it that way it has the potential to irritate some hotel owners but its a move dad calls the most transformational event thats happened here in a long time with david making one of his first significant public decisions at marriott international the questions are inevitable is he the real deal and if he is will he one day run the company his dad built the questions follow david in a sort of silhouette i would be a complete liar if i would say there is no pressure there he said sitting on the couch of his office near a labyrinth of cubicles at the companys headquarters as a marriott you always live with the feeling that youre being looked at under a microscope there are four marriott children the oldest at age  is debbie who works on government affairs stephen  has a rare muscular disorder that has left him hearingimpaired and blind and he works on culture issues and special events john  was head of lodging but left the company two years ago to run his familys investments that leaves david as the only marriott offspring working on daytoday operations he has run global sales for three years overseeing a department that takes in roughly  percent of the business at marriotts fullservice hotels his first major initiative  called salesforce one  shifts salespeople out of the companys hotels and into regional sales offices where they will sell rooms at dozens of marriott properties not just the hotel where they were based the idea is to sell to customers the way they want to be sold to not by individual sales people calling from every hotel in a region but one point of contact offering rooms at a variety of properties it helps marriott which manages hotels please its deeppocketed corporate clients streamlining the booking process but the companys hotels have individual owners with their own economic interests until now owners could rest assured that salespeople were specifically focused on selling their property a regional sales approach will definitely have greater appeal to the clients who we must ultimately serve and therefore should increase brand preference said fred malek a former top executive at marriott who owns several of the companys hotels but it also has to be blended with consideration for the profitloss interest of individual general managers in a diverse
