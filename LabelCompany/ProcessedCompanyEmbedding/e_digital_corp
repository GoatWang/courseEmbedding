facility were sold to intel initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed dec to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them their pdp series of machines became popular in the s especially the pdp widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer looking to simplify and update their line dec replaced most of their smaller machines with the pdp in  eventually selling over  units and cementing decs position in the industry originally designed as a followon to the pdp decs vax series was the first widely used bit minicomputer sometimes referred to as superminis these systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers such as the ibm system the vax was a bestseller with over  sold and its sales through the s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late s and especially the introduction of powerful bit systems in the s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha bit risc instruction set architecture dec initially started work on alpha as a way to reimplement their vax series but also employed it in a range of highperformance workstations although the alpha processor family met both of these goals and for most of its lifetime was the fastest processor family on the market extremely

set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso  latin and by extension unicode the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp then the pdps which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os tops tops rstse rsx rt and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp systems more than  years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to decs oses including command names such as dir and help and the namedotextension file naming conventions vax and microvax computers very widespread in the s running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks decnet which linked business and research facilities the decnet protocols formed one of the first peertopeer networking standards with decnet phase i being released in the mids email file sharing and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market dec intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid  and raid  capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the la and la dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt or its more capable successor the vt the x window system the network transparent window system used on unix and linux and also available on other operating systems was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science dec was the primary sponsor for this project which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it in the period – linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering departmentdisputed – discuss compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules a wellknown linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat  another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux notes and its followon product vax notes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software a category that has become to be known as groupware len kawell one of the original notes developers later joined lotus development corporation and contributed to their lotus notes product dec was one of the first businesses connected to the internet with deccom registered in  being one of the first of the now ubiquitous com domains decs gatekeeperdeccom was a wellknown software repository during the preworld wide web days and dec was also the first computer vendor to open a public website on  october  the popular altavista created by dec was one of the first comprehensive internet search engines although lycos was earlier it was much more limited dec invented digital linear tape dlt formerly known as compactape which began as a compact backup medium for microvax systems and later grew to capacities of  gigabytes work on the first harddiskbased mpplayer the personal jukebox started at the dec systems research center the project was started about a month before the merger into compaq was completed decs western research lab created the itsy

 by compaq which subsequently merged with hewlettpackard hp in may  some parts of dec notably the compiler business and the hudson massachusetts facility were sold to intel initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed dec to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them their pdp series of machines became popular in the s especially the pdp widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer looking to simplify and update their line dec replaced most of their smaller machines with the pdp in  eventually selling over  units and cementing decs position in the industry originally designed as a followon to the pdp decs vax series was the first widely used bit minicomputer sometimes referred to as superminis these systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers such as the ibm system the vax was a bestseller with over  sold and its sales through the s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late s and especially the introduction of powerful bit systems in the s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha bit risc instruction set architecture dec initially started work on alpha as a way to reimplement their vax series but also employed it in a range of highperformance workstations although the

appropriate editing help is available august  dec supported the ansi standards especially the ascii character set which survives in unicode and the iso  character set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso  latin and by extension unicode the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp then the pdps which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os tops tops rstse rsx rt and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp systems more than  years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to decs oses including command names such as dir and help and the namedotextension file naming conventions vax and microvax computers very widespread in the s running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks decnet which linked business and research facilities the decnet protocols formed one of the first peertopeer networking standards with decnet phase i being released in the mids email file sharing and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market dec intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid  and raid  capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the la and la dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt or its more capable successor the vt the x window system the network transparent window system used on unix and linux and also available on other operating systems was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science dec was the primary sponsor for this project which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it in the period – linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering departmentdisputed –

industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late s and especially the introduction of powerful bit systems in the s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha bit risc instruction

august  dec supported the ansi standards especially the ascii character set which survives in unicode and the iso  character set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso  latin and by extension unicode the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp then the pdps which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os tops tops rstse rsx rt and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp systems more than  years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to decs oses including command names such as dir and help and the namedotextension file naming conventions vax and microvax computers very widespread in the s running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks decnet which linked business and research facilities the decnet protocols formed one of the first peertopeer networking standards with decnet phase i being released in the mids email file sharing and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market dec intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid  and raid  capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the la and la dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt or its more capable successor the vt the x window system the network transparent window system used on unix and linux and also available on other operating systems was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science dec was the primary sponsor for this project which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it in the period – linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering departmentdisputed – discuss compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules a wellknown linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat  another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux notes and its followon product vax notes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software a category that has become to be known as groupware len kawell one of the original notes developers later joined lotus development corporation and contributed to their lotus notes product dec was one of the first businesses connected to the internet with deccom registered in  being one of the first of the now ubiquitous com domains decs gatekeeperdeccom was a wellknown software repository during the preworld wide web days and dec was also the first computer vendor to open a public website on  october  the popular altavista created by dec was one of the first comprehensive internet search engines although lycos was earlier it was much more limited dec invented digital linear tape dlt formerly known as compactape which began as a compact backup medium for microvax systems and later grew to capacities of  gigabytes work on the first harddiskbased mpplayer the personal jukebox started at the dec systems research center the project was started about a month before the merger into compaq was completed decs western research lab created the itsy pocket computer this was developed into the compaq ipaq line of pdas which

the vax was a bestseller with over  sold and its sales through the s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late s and especially the introduction of powerful bit systems in the s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha bit risc instruction set architecture dec initially started work on alpha as a

set which survives in unicode and the iso  character set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso  latin and by extension unicode the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp then the pdps which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os tops tops rstse rsx rt and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp systems more than  years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family

create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid  and raid  capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the la and la dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt or its more capable successor the vt the x

alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering departmentdisputed – discuss compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules a wellknown linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat  another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux notes and its followon product vax notes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software a

with hewlettpackard hp in may  some parts of dec notably the compiler business and the hudson massachusetts facility were sold to intel initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed dec to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them their pdp series of machines became popular in the s especially the pdp widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer looking to simplify and update their line dec replaced most of their smaller machines with the pdp in  eventually selling over  units and cementing decs position in the industry originally designed as a followon to the pdp decs vax series was the first widely used bit minicomputer sometimes referred to as superminis these systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers such as the ibm system the vax was a bestseller with over  sold and its sales through the s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry at its peak dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts second only to the massachusetts state government the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late s and especially the introduction of powerful bit systems in the s quickly eroded the value of decs systems decs last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha bit risc instruction set architecture dec initially started work on alpha as a way to reimplement their vax series but also employed it in a range of highperformance workstations although the alpha processor family met both of these goals and for most of its lifetime was the fastest processor family on the market extremely high asking pricesbetter source needed were outsold by lower priced x chips from intel and

august  dec supported the ansi standards especially the ascii character set which survives in unicode and the iso  character set family decs own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso  latin and by extension unicode the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on decs pdp series of computers first on a pdp then the pdps which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers although for several years dec itself did not encourage the use of unix dec produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems including os tops tops rstse rsx rt and openvms pdp computers in particular the pdp model inspired a generation of programmers and software developers some pdp systems more than  years old software and hardware are still being used to control and monitor factories transportation systems and nuclear plants dec was an early champion of timesharing systems the commandline interfaces found in decs systems eventually codified as dcl would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis those used in earlier systems such as ctss ibms jcl or univacs timesharing systems would look utterly alien many features of the cpm and msdos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to decs oses including command names such as dir and help and the namedotextension file naming conventions vax and microvax computers very widespread in the s running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks decnet which linked business and research facilities the decnet protocols formed one of the first peertopeer networking standards with decnet phase i being released in the mids email file sharing and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market dec intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard were champions of ethernet but dec is the company that made ethernet commercially successful initially ethernetbased decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter multiple generations of ethernet hardware from dec were the de facto standard the ci computer interconnect adapter was the industrys first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive rings dec also invented clustering an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc and later series of hierarchical storage controllers hsc the hscs delivered the first hardware raid  and raid  capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as websearches and drug research the la and la dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation the vt computer terminal became the industry standard implementing a useful subset of the ansi x standard and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal putty and xterm still emulate a vt or its more capable successor the vt the x window system the network transparent window system used on unix and linux and also available on other operating systems was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science dec was the primary sponsor for this project which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it in the period – linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering departmentdisputed – discuss compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules a wellknown linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat  another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux notes and its followon product vax notes were two of the first examples of online collaboration software a category that has become to be known as groupware len kawell one of the original notes developers later joined lotus development corporation and contributed to their lotus notes product dec was one of the first businesses connected to the internet with deccom registered in  being one of the first of the now ubiquitous com domains decs gatekeeperdeccom was a wellknown software repository during the preworld wide web days and dec was also the first computer vendor to open a public website on  october  the popular altavista created by dec was one of the first comprehensive internet search engines although lycos was earlier it was much more limited dec invented digital linear tape dlt formerly known as compactape which began as a compact backup medium for microvax systems and later grew to capacities of  gigabytes work on the first harddiskbased mpplayer the personal jukebox started at the dec systems research center the

to say it wasnt reassigned and simply not noted yet but it would have to be somewhere in the process for licensing take place for pn to use his own creationyou own it or you license it i would further
