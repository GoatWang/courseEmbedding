cover star said the pair felt now was the time to part ways‘julien has a project to develop a new fund focused on equity and equitylike investments and stanhope is entirely independent and does not have inhouse products so he decided to do it outside of stanhope’ he said‘it makes sense he kept some role with us and the investment committee is a good forum and way of maintaining links while giving him the freedom to do his new project‘it is happening in a good and friendly atmosphere’sevaux added ‘i believe now is a prime moment for me to carve out some time for a new entrepreneurial effort which will be complementary to stanhope’meanwhile the firm has promoted senior director charles franklin to partner within its charities team and pinto said the company will also shortly be announcing a ‘high profile’ addition to its advisory board to help spearhead its push in latin america the board which is chaired by former bp chairman lord browne also includes wpp chief executive sir martin sorrell christie’s americas chairman emeritus stephen lash and m shafik gabr chairman and managing director of the artoc group‘we have the commitment of a high profile individual in latin

india but has no imminent plans to open a branch thereelsewhere pinto said stanhope raised  million for new feeder funds to access vehicles across three asset classes – private equity real estate and private finance‘the minimum requirement for the best funds is often  million and by pooling client assets we can provide access it’s an important development for us and something we will continue to pursue’ he said   email a friend pinto why stanhopes cofounders parted ways there was an error sending your email please try again email addresses to send to your email address your name email sent

on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ucits this includes hedge funds funds of hedge funds venture capital and private equity funds and real estate funds such alternative investment funds aifs are for “wellinformed” investors institutional professional and qualified investorsas one of the first european countries the luxembourg parliament adopted the law transposing the alternative investment fund manager directive aifmd into luxembourg law on  july  the law relating to investment managers of alternative investment funds was published in the memorial a n°  on  july  this presented an opportunity for luxembourg to create a brand in the alternative investment market similar to the global brand it previously created with ucits the aifmd introduced a european passport for alternative investment fund managers who wish to access the entire european market through the aifmd the european union created the first regulated environment for alternative investment funds worldwidemoreover the european union acknowledged the need to overcome the existence of multiple fragmented national regimes by introducing a separate marketing passport regime under the regulation on european venture capital funds euveca and the regulation on european social entrepreneurship funds eusef respectivelytype of fundsthe four main professional investmentstructuring solutions in luxembourg arethe sif which provides an operationally flexible and fiscally efficient multipurpose vehicle that can be used for all asset classesthe sicar which is specifically designed for private equity investment and venture capitalthe uci part ii a flexible but more regulated pooled vehiclethe raif a nonregulated fund with quick time to market due to no regulatory approval necessarythe sif sicar and the uci part ii are lightly regulated investment vehicles subject to approval and ongoing supervision by the cssf the raif offers many of the same features as the sif and the sicar but removes the double layer of regulation only the manager is regulated  the fund itself is not from a legal perspective aifs may take the legal form ofa public limited company saa private limited company sà rla partnership limited by shares scaa limited partnership scsa special limited partnership scspa common investment fund fcptype of assetsneither sifs nor sicars are required to comply with detailed asset limitations investment restrictions or leverage rules nevertheless a sif must adhere to the principle of risk diversification however the cssf may allow derogations on the basis of appropriate justificationby contrast a sicar may concentrate its holdings into one project the only requirement being to invest in risk capitalthe most recent addition to the luxembourg fund toolbox is the raif which is not subject to any regulatory approval by the cssf permitting a significantly enhanced timetomarket for new fund launches a feat especially appreciated by private equity and venture capital fund initiatorsthe uci part ii exists for promoters of funds that do not meet all the criteria for a ucits but which are substantially regulated and therefore also accessible to retail investors in luxembourgall these vehicles can be structured either as a stand alone fund with a single portfolio investment or as a multiple compartment fund which within a single legal entity creates separate subfunds compartments with different investment policieseach legal entity and each fund compartment can issue an unlimited number of share classes based on the needs of the specific clients to whom the shares must be solda luxembourg fund which qualifies as aif under the aifm law and is managed by an aifm based in the eu is eligible for a passport for sale in europe related
