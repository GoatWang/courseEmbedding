these risk factors together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected   our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern which may hinder our ability to continue as a going concern and our ability to obtain future financing   in their report dated march   our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the period ended december   were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern and they expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this doubt is based entirely upon the company’s current lack of resources to execute its business plan in our early stages of development and operation we expect to experience net losses our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit andor obtain necessary funding from outside sources including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible if we are unable to continue as a going concern you may lose your entire investment   without taking into account the offering we will run out of funds approximately october   following this offering we will additionally incur public company reporting costs of approximately  per year or  per quarter to fund the company’s operating expenses following october   the company will clearly require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance such additional business it may

to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the company in that case the company may need to suspend its operations and reevaluate and revise its plan of operations   we commenced initial operations in may  and have a limited operating history and accordingly you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives   we are an early stage emerging growth company with no sales to date since we do not have an established operating history or regular sales yet you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives   the absence of any significant operating history for us makes forecasting our revenue and expenses difficult and we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls or unexpected expenses   as a result of the absence of any operating history for us it is difficult to accurately forecast our future revenue in addition we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses current and future expense levels are based on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on our ability to promote and sell our services as a result we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which would result in further substantial losses we may also be unable to expand our operations in a timely manner to adequately meet demand to the extent it exceeds expectations          our limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision   we are currently in the early stages of developing our business there can be no assurance that at this time that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due   investors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies particularly in rapidly evolving markets such risks include the following     ● competition         ● ability to anticipate and adapt to a competitive market         ● ability to effectively manage expanding operations amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business operations and infrastructure and         ● dependence upon key personnel to market and sell our services and the loss of one of our key managers may adversely affect the marketing of our services   we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks in the event that we do not successfully address these risks our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations          we have no profitable operating history and may never achieve profitability   from inception xtribe plc the “company” was organized to develop free smartphone applications which allow the user to sell buy swap and rent objects and services utilizing an active geolocation tool which locates all potential customers within any specified geographic target the company will derive revenues by through its bb division xtribe store in this regard the company seeks to reshape smartphone ecommerce by delivering a new easytouse application providing added value to the user as of the date of this prospectus the company has yet to engage in any meaningful business activities through december   the company has not generated any revenues and the company has operated with minimal overhead we are faced with all of the risks associated with a company in the early stages of development our business is subject to numerous risks associated with a relatively new lowcapitalized company engaged in our business sector such risks include but are not limited to competition from wellestablished and wellcapitalized companies and unanticipated difficulties regarding the marketing and sale of our applications there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability should this be the case our ordinary shares could become worthless and investors in our ordinary shares or other securities could lose their entire investment   the inability to obtain this funding either in the near term andor longer term will materially affect the ability of the company to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the company in that case the company may need to suspend its operations and reevaluate and revise its plan of operations   the company may be unable to complete its expansion plans if it does not raise sufficient funds in the offering   taking into account financial resources on hand which will permit the company to operate through october  the company needs to raise at least  in its offering in order to complete the rollout of its products in italy the company will need to raise at least  or more in its offering in order to expand to other markets including the united states see use of proceeds if the company is not able to raise sufficient funding it may need to scale back operations andor defer entry into more lucrative markets this inability may significantly hamper the growth prospects of the company and impair shareholder value   dependence on our management without whose services company business operations could cease   at this time our management is wholly responsible for the development and execution of our business plan our management is under no contractual obligation to remain employed by us although they have no present intent to leave if our management should choose to leave us for any reason before we have hired additional personnel our operations may fail even if we are able to find additional personnel it is uncertain whether we could find qualified management who could develop our business along the lines described herein or would be willing to work for compensation the company could afford without such management the company could be forced to cease operations and investors in our ordinary shares or other securities could lose their entire investment   our officers and directors devote limited time to the company’s business and are engaged in other business activities   at this time only our chief executive officer devotes full time to the business and the chairman and chief financial officer devote approximately onehalf of their time to the business without fulltime devoted management the company could be forced to cease operations and investors in our ordinary shares or other securities could lose their entire investment   our officers and directors may not be subject to service of process or the subject to the bringing of or enforcement of actions against them due to their residency outside the united states   the officers and directors of the company are all resident outside the united states as a result it may be difficult or impossible a to effect service of process within the united states on the company’s officers and directors b to enforce judgments obtained in us courts based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws against the officers and directors c to enforce judgments of us courts based on civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in foreign courts against the company’s officers and directors and d to bring an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the us federal securities laws against the company’s officers and directors as a result company shareholders and investors may find themselves without effective recourse against any of the company’s officers and directors   concentrated control risks shareholders could be unable to control or influence key corporate actions or effect changes in the company’s board of directors or management   our current officers and directors currently own approximately  ordinary shares including shares held by entities of which they are a beneficial owner representing approximately  of the voting control of the company our current officers and directors therefore have the power to make all major decisions regarding our affairs including decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what consideration whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration and whether or not to authorize more stock for issuance or otherwise amend our charter or bylaws          lack of additional working capital may cause curtailment of any expansion plans while raising of capital through sale of equity securities would dilute existing shareholders’ percentage of ownership   without taking into account the offering we will run out of funds approximately october   following this offering we will additionally incur public company reporting costs of approximately  per year or  per quarter to fund the company’s operating expenses following october   the company will clearly require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance additional applications and services it may identify there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and have no current arrangements for any such financing a shortage of capital would affect our ability to fund our working capital requirements if we require additional capital funds may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of these securities could dilute existing shareholders if funds are not available we could be placed in the position of having to cease all operations   we do not presently have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution this absence may adversely affect our operations   we are authorized to issue unlimited ordinary shares of which as of december    were issued and outstanding no preference shares are issued and outstanding as of december   additional shares may be issued by our board of directors without further shareholder approval the issuance of large numbers of shares possibly at below market prices is likely to result in substantial dilution to the interests of other shareholders in addition issuances of large numbers of shares may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares   our inability to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenues could adversely affect our financial condition   no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenue in order to cover our operating expenses and achieve sustainable profitability without such critical mass of revenues the company could be forced to cease operations   our success is substantially dependent on general economic conditions and business trends a downturn of which could adversely affect our operations   the success of our operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending these factors include economic conditions activity in the financial markets general business conditions personnel cost inflation interest rates and taxation our business is affected by the general condition and economic stability of our consumers and their continued willingness to accept our products and services an overall decline in the economy could cause a reduction in our sales and the company could face a situation where it never achieves a critical mass of revenues and thereby be forced to cease operations          the company’s business is subject to the risk of foreign currency exchange losses due to fluctuations in various currencies in the markets where it operates   the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings on the other hand strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of products and services denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company has not yet adopted a strategy to deal with these issues which could have a material impact on the company’s operating results   changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows revenue and results of operations   we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance principles or concepts issued by among other authorities the american institute of certified public accountants the financial accounting standards board and the united states securities and exchange commission our management believes that our current contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported however there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the industries in which we operate future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition andor other accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows revenue and results of operations   we will need to increase the size of our organization and may experience difficulties in managing growth   we are a small company with no current fulltime employees we expect to experience a period of significant expansion in headcount facilities infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth and market opportunities future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management including the need to identify recruit maintain and integrate managers our future financial performance and its ability to compete effectively will depend in part on its ability to manage any future growth effectively   we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   we have offered and sold our ordinary shares to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we have not received a legal opinion to the effect that any of our prior offerings were exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we have relied upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemptions including information provided by investors themselves   if any prior offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies          we incur costs associated with sec reporting compliance   the company made the decision to become an sec “reporting company” in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations we incur certain costs of compliance with applicable sec reporting rules and regulations including but not limited to attorneys fees accounting and auditing fees other professional fees financial printing costs and sarbanesoxley compliance costs in an amount estimated at approximately  per year on balance the company determined that the incurrence of such costs and expenses was preferable to the company being in a position where it had very limited access to additional capital funding   the availability of a large number of authorized but unissued shares of ordinary stock may upon their issuance lead to dilution of existing shareholders   we are authorized to issue unlimited ordinary shares of which as of december    were issued and outstanding no preference shares are issued and outstanding as of october   additional shares may be issued by our board of directors without further shareholder approval the issuance of large numbers of shares possibly at below market prices is likely to result in substantial dilution to the interests of other shareholders in addition issuances of large numbers of shares may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares   our need for additional capital that could dilute the ownership interest of investors   we require substantial working capital to fund our business if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or convertible debt securities these securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and they may experience additional dilution we cannot predict whether additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all since our inception we have experienced negative cash flow from operations and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future the issuance of additional ordinary shares or preference shares by the company may have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our ordinary shares   we may not have adequate internal accounting controls while we have certain internal procedures in our budgeting forecasting and in the management and allocation of funds our internal controls may not be adequate   we are constantly striving to improve our internal accounting controls our board of directors has not designated an audit committee and we do not have any outside directors we do not have a dedicated full time chief financial officer we hope to develop an adequate internal accounting control to budget forecast manage and allocate our funds and account for them there is no guarantee that such improvements will be adequate or successful or that such improvements will be carried out on a timely basis if we do not have adequate internal accounting controls we may not be able to appropriately budget forecast and manage our funds we may also be unable to prepare accurate accounts on a timely basis to meet our continuing financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under us securities laws          we may not have adequate insurance coverage   we currently have only general liability insurance and we cannot assure you that we would not face liability upon the occurrence of any uninsured event which could result in any loss or damages being assessed against the company   we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business   our operations are subject to extensive national state and local laws and regulations relating to the financial markets future laws or regulations any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business results of operations and financial condition we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations our operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations   we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future   we currently intend to retain all future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate   there is currently no market for our securities and there can be no assurance that any market will ever develop or that our ordinary shares will be listed for trading   there has not been any established trading market for our ordinary shares and there is currently no market for our securities even if we are ultimately approved for trading on the nyse mkt or other markets there can be no assurance as the prices at which our ordinary shares will trade if a trading market develops of which there can be no assurance until our ordinary shares are fully distributed and an orderly market develops if ever in our ordinary shares the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly   prices for our ordinary shares will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors including the depth and liquidity of the market for the ordinary shares developments affecting our business including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere in these risk factors investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions no assurances can be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for our ordinary shares due to the anticipated low price of the securities many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities   our ordinary shares are subject to the penny stock regulations   our ordinary shares will likely be subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules to the extent that the price remains less than  those rules which require delivery of a schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks before any sale may further limit your ability to sell your shares   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less than  per share our ordinary shares when and if a trading market develops may fall within the definition of penny stock and subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally those with assets in excess of  or annual incomes exceeding  or  together with their spouse   for transactions covered by these rules the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser’s prior written consent to the transaction additionally for any transaction other than exempt transactions involving a penny stock the rules require the delivery prior to the transaction of a risk disclosure document mandated by the commission relating to the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative current quotations for the securities and if the brokerdealer is the sole marketmaker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market finally monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks consequently the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our ordinary shares and may affect the ability of investors to sell their ordinary shares in the secondary market          our ordinary shares are illiquid and subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations   the market price of our ordinary shares could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry trading volume in our ordinary shares changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us in addition the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our ordinary shares sales of substantial amounts of ordinary shares or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities   management will have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering and we may not use the proceeds effectively   our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our shares our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business stunt the growth of our business domestically and in foreign markets and cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline          you will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value per share of the ordinary shares you purchase   since the price per ordinary share being offered is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per ordinary share you will suffer substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the ordinary shares you purchase in this offering based on the public offering price of  per share if you purchase ordinary shares in this offering you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of  per share in the net tangible book value of the ordinary shares assuming  of the shares offered are sold  per share if  of the shares offered are sold  if  of the shares offered are sold and  per share is  of the shares offered are sold see the section entitled “dilution” below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase ordinary shares in this offering   you may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings and other issuances of our ordinary shares or other securities in addition this offering and future equity offerings and other issuances of our ordinary shares or other securities may adversely affect our ordinary share price   in order to raise additional capital we may in the future offer additional shares of our ordinary shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our ordinary shares including but not limited to preference shares and convertible debt we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders the price per share at which we sell additional ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering in addition the sale of shares in this offering and any future sales of a substantial number of ordinary shares in the public market or the perception that such sales may occur could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of those shares of ordinary shares or the availability of those ordinary shares for sale will have on the market price of our ordinary shares   we have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures in the absence of which shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters   recent federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics we have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange we are not required to do so it is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions   we may be deemed to be a “shell company”   rule  promulgated under the securities act of  defines a “shell company” as a registrant…that has no or nominal operations and either a no or nominal assets b assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or c assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets while the company does not believe that it is a “shell company” designation as a “shell company” could result in the application of rule i which would limit the availability of the exemption from registration provided in rule  for certain shares of company ordinary shares and could result in certain persons affiliated with the company being deemed “statutory underwriters under rule c          for as long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation that apply to other public companies   in april  president obama signed into law the jumpstart our business startups act or the jobs act the jobs act contains provisions that among other things relax certain reporting requirements for “emerging growth companies” including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure we are classified as an emerging growth company for as long as we are an emerging growth company which may be up to five full fiscal years unlike other public companies we will not be required to among other things  provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanes oxley act of   comply with any new requirements adopted by the public company accounting oversight board or the pcaob requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer  comply with any new audit rules adopted by the pcaob after april   unless the sec determines otherwise  provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or  hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation   further our independent registered public accounting firm is not yet required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and will not be required to do so for as long as we are an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act   under the jobs act we have elected to use an extended period for complying with new or revised accounting standards   we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b which allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates          risks related to our business and industry   if the market does not accept or embrace our applications and services our business may fail   the applications and services we are offering have not been tested in the market on a largescale basis as a result we can only speculate as to the market acceptance of these products and services no assurance can be given that the market will accept our products and services or any of them if the public fails to accept our products and services to a satisfactory degree our business may fail   our market is highly competitive   the market for smartphone applications is highly competitive and most competitive companies and products will be far better financed and capitalized and have substantially greater resources than ours while we believe that our applications and services are competitive with applications and services provided by other companies there is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively compete against them and if we do not effectively compete our business may fail   if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately our business could be adversely affected   we seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets copyrights confidentiality noncompete and nondisclosure agreements trademarks domain names and other measures some of which afford only limited protection despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states intellectual property protections may also be unavailable limited or difficult to enforce in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   an assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and timeconsuming litigation or expensive licenses and our business might be harmed   we might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation defending such claims regardless of their merit could be timeconsuming and distracting to management result in costly litigation or settlement cause development delays or require us to enter into licensing agreements          special note regarding

proceeds   if the company’s offering of  new ordinary shares is fully subscribed the company will raise the gross amount of  the following shows use of the proceeds of the company offering at various

such shares will go to the selling shareholders as described below in the sections entitled “selling security holders” and “plan of distribution” we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the ordinary shares for the selling shareholders          determination of offering price   since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system the offering price of the shares was arbitrarily determined   the offering price of the company’s shares has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value assets past operating results financial condition or any other established criteria of value the facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market although our ordinary shares is not listed on a public exchange we intend to apply for listing on the nyse mkt or other markets prior to completion of the offering in order to be quoted on the nyse mkt or other trading markets a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our ordinary shares there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with finra nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved   in addition there is no assurance that our ordinary shares will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the ordinary shares in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors including the depth and liquidity   the selling shareholders may sell their shares in the overthecounter market or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to the prevailing market price or at negotiated prices we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares by the selling shareholders   dilution   our historical net tangible book value as of december   was approximately  or approximately  per share of ordinary stock after adjusting for all forward stock splits our historical net tangible book value is the amount of our total tangible assets less our liabilities historical net tangible book value per common share is our historical net tangible book value divided by the number of shares of ordinary stock outstanding as of december     after giving effect to the sale of  shares of our ordinary stock in this offering at the public offering price of  per share of ordinary shares and after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us our asadjusted net tangible book value as of december   would have been approximately  or  per share of ordinary stock after adjusting for all forward stock splits this represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of approximately  per share to our existing ordinary stockholders and an immediate dilution of approximately  per ordinary share to new investors purchasing securities in this offering at the assumed public offering price     the following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis   assuming  shares sold in offering  of shares offered with gross proceeds of        assumed public offering price per share    historical net tangible

shareholder matters   holders   as of december   there were approximately  record holders of our ordinary shares as of december   there were  ordinary shares issued and outstanding no public market currently exists for our ordinary shares or preference shares we intend to apply to have our shares initially listed for quotation on the nyse mkt andor other trading markets   the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of    the securities and exchange commission has also adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock the shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the securities and exchange act the shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate hisher investment any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to rules g through g of the securities and exchange act rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the commission which     ● contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading         ● contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the securities act of  as amended         ● contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price         ● contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions         ● defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and         ● contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the securities and exchange commission shall require by rule or regulation          the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock to the customer     ● the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock         ● the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction         ● the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and         ● monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules

for application development with a company in which the chief executive officer has a material interest as of december   and  this company was owed  and  during the years ended december   and  the company paid  and  to this company there is no written agreement between the parties   strategic outlook   we believe that the connectivity between by buyers and sellers the geolocation attributes and the multilingual capabilities of our application will provide the source for our success in a currently underutilized market   as our registered user base grows we intend to hire additional information technology staff to maintain our product offerings and develop new products to increase our market share   we believe that our nearterm success will depend particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our application  since we have limited capital resources we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets that we have limited financial resources and face an uncertain economic environment we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties   results of operations   comparison of the year ended december   and    the following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  the following information should be considered together with our condensed financial statements for such period and the accompanying notes thereto   net revenuenet loss   we have not generated significant revenue since our inception for the years ended december   and  we have not generated any sales for the years ended december   and  we had a net loss of  and    general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   the increase resulted primarily from increases in consulting costs of  and management fees of    sales and marketing   sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   were  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this is a result of its continuing marketing campaign during the year ended december   to increase market awareness           research and development   research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  an increase of  the increase is related to enhancements and updates to the application software   liquidity and capital resources   as of march   the company has a cash position of approximately  based upon the current cash position and the company’s planned expense run rate management believes the company has funds currently to finance its operations through october    net cash used in operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   the increase resulted primarily from other receivables related to the reimbursement of software development costs and the net loss described above   net cash provided by financing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended

loans payable – shareholders of approximately  compared to  during the year ended december   and the repayment of loans payable shareholders of approximately  compared to  during the year ended december            as we have not realized any revenues since our inception we have financed our operations through private offerings of debt and equity securities we do not currently maintain a line of credit or term loan with any commercial bank or other financial institution   since our inception we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan we believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations during the next twelve months we currently need to generate sufficient revenues to support our cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred finance the development of our platform and execute the business plan if we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan we intend to seek to raise such financing through the sale of debt andor equity securities the issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders if we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us we will be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   even if we are successful in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to complete the platform our ability to continue in business as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains our business operations there can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient proceeds or any proceeds for us to implement fully our proposed business plan moreover there can be no assurance we will generate revenues sufficient to fund our operations in either such situation we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail    offbalance sheet arrangements   as of december   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

par value of the ordinary shares from  to  the accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization for all periods presented unless otherwise specified   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates   concentration of credit risk   the company is exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business primarily related to accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents substantially all of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with a financial institution in england namely hsbc which are not insured or otherwise protected the company maintained balances of  and  with this institution as of december   and  respectively the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts in england    f      comprehensive income   the company follows financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification “fasb asc”  “comprehensive income” in reporting comprehensive income comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income the company has one item of other comprehensive income consisting of a foreign translation adjustment   foreign currency transactions and translation   the functional currency of the operations of the company is the euro the capitalization of the company is provided in british pounds “gbp” while the company transacts a majority of its other transactions including loans from shareholders in euros which makes the euro the functional currency gains and losses resulting from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the company are recorded in the statement of operations for the reporting periods as part of general and administrative expense included in general and administrative expense were foreign currency transaction losses of  and  for the years ended december   and    the reporting currency of the company is the united states us dollar the financial statements in functional currency are translated to us dollars using the closing rate of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rate of exchange for the statement of operations the capital accounts are translated at historical rate translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses and loans payable the carrying value of accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of their short maturities the company believes the carrying amount of its loans payable approximate fair value based on rates and other terms currently available to the company for similar debt instruments   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of reporting cash flows the company considers all cash accounts which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties and certificates of deposit and commercial paper with original maturities of  days or less to be cash or cash equivalents   software   software is stated at cost amortization is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets principally five years maintenance and upgrades to the software are charged to operations upon retirement sale or other disposition of software the costs and accumulated amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations   longlived assets   the company evaluates the recoverability of its longlived assets in accordance with fasb asc  “property plant and equipment” the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of longlived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset undiscounted and without interest or independent appraisals if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets    f      revenue recognition   in accordance with fasb asc  “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement exists ii a retailer distributor or wholesaler receives the goods and acceptance occurs iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured subject to these criteria the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon the application initialization on the xtribe store by the customer     income taxes   the company follows fasb asc  when accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities tax years from  through  remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions   advertising costs   advertising costs are expensed as incurred advertising costs were  and  for the years ended december   and  and are included in sales and marketing expenses   research and development costs   in accordance with fasb asc  research and development costs are expensed when incurred research and development costs for the years ended december   and  were  and    on june   the company entered into an agency agreement whereby the agent would receive five percent of all sales that the agent introduced to the company in addition the agent would reimburse the company  percent of the software development costs that the company had expended which were  as of june   therefore the amount of  was billed to the agent in british pounds £ and was to be paid by december   and has been recorded as other receivable as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates the other receivable was  as of december   the company has extended the payment terms of the receivable as the amounts due are from a vendor in  the company began offsetting amounts owed to the vendor against payments due on the receivable as of the date of this report the amounts offset totaled    software development costs that were incurred during six months ended june   amounting to  have been completely offset by the agent’s reimbursement with the remaining reimbursement balance of  reflected as other income for the year ended december     software development costs that were incurred during the year ended december   have been expensed as incurred and recorded in research and development costs in the statement of operations   basic and diluted net income per share of ordinary shares   the company follows fasb asc  “earnings per share” when reporting earnings per share resulting in the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share because the company reported a net loss for each of the years presented and because the company has no ordinary share equivalents the amounts reported for basic and diluted loss per share were the same   recently adopted accounting pronouncements   in august  the fasb issued asu  presentation of financial statements – going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the amendments in this update provide guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events considered in the aggregate indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued the amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the amendments were adopted as of december   see note  for management’s evaluation and disclosure    f      recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted   in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services   in august  the fasb issued asu  which deferred the effective date of update  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   the company anticipates that the impact of this guidance on the financial statements will not be material   in november  the fasb issued asu no  income taxes topic  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on the financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases topic  the amendments in this update specify the accounting for leases the core principle of topic  is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company anticipates that the impact of this guidance on the financial statements will not be material   in march  the fasb issued asu no  compensation – stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions including  income tax consequences  classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and  classification on the statement of cash flows for public companies the amendments in the asu are effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods the company currently does not have employee sharebased payments and therefore the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on the financial statements   note  – management plans   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   since inception the company has focused on developing and implementing its business plan the company believes that its existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain operations during the next twelve months the company currently needs to generate revenue in order to sustain its operations in the event that the company cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations the company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt andor equity securities the issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders if the company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the company the company would likely be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred which would have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations    f      based upon the current cash position and the company’s planned expense run rate management believes the company has funds currently to finance its operations through october    note  – loans payable – shareholders   during the year ended december   the company received loans in the amount of  from two shareholders in which one of them is the chief executive officer of the company see note    during the year ended december   the company received loans in the amount of  from four shareholders of which one of them was the same as in the december   loan transactions   during the year ended december   the company repaid  of the loan payable – shareholders to its chief executive officer   the loans are interestfree and unsecured with no formal repayment terms   note  – income taxes   the company follows fasb asc  whereby an entity recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences or events that have been previously recognized in the company’s financial statements or tax returns the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax law the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated   at december   the company has trading losses in the united kingdom which is similar to net operating losses in the united states of approximately  these losses can be carried forward to offset future taxable income indefinitely deferred tax assets would arise from the recognition of anticipated utilization of these net operating losses to offset future taxable income   the income tax benefit provision consists of the following      december        current     deferred     change in valuation allowance                                f      the following is a reconciliation of the tax derived by applying the

costs     valuation allowance                     net         management determined that realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured and recorded a valuation allowance for the amount of such benefits   as of january   the company had no unrecognized tax benefits and accordingly the company did not recognize interest or penalties during  and  related to unrecognized tax benefits there has been no change in unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended december   and  and there was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of december   and  tax years from  through  remain subject to

shareholders who is also the chief executive officer of the company see note    as of december   and  the company owed shareholders other than those described above  and     f      item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   none     item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedure include without limitations controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   in accordance with exchange act rules a and d an evaluation was completed by the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this prospectus based on that evaluation as of december   the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed or submitted under the exchange act was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that   ● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company     ● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and     ● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk          as of december   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the period ended december     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items  and  above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   management’s remediation initiatives   given the financial resources available to the company the company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controlsa s such time as the company commences operations and has the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses we intend to take action to do so unfortunately until the company has such financial resources the identified weaknesses will continue to exist   changes in internal control over financial reporting during the period from inception december   through december   there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of controls a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within a company have been detected          prospectus    ordinary shares of   xtribe plc        dealer prospectus
