equidate investment why should i consider this asset class diversification and exposurethe private tech market is quickly becoming a meaningful portion of the suite of asset classes available in today’s financial markets assuming you already have a sufficiently diversified portfolio across a range of safe and moderately safe securities it is certainly worth considering for inclusion in a balanced portfolioof course each investors situation is different and suitability is a casebycase conversation but for many accredited investors latestage private market investments can certainly offer compelling investment opportunities while the companies are in the rapid value creation phase havent found the answer youre looking for contact support i am an accredited individual or family office why is equidate a good fit in public and liquid markets strategic advantages and inefficiencies have been squeezed out through greater automation highfrequency trading and increasing

be  million which may not be the right bite size for smaller or medium sized funds we help provide access to the underlying companys stock in such situations havent found the answer youre looking for contact support i run a longterm conservative fund such as an endowment pension fund or sovereign wealth fund why is equidate a good fit for a sufficiently large pool of capital exposure to as many asset classes as possible is crucial as one of our advisors reminds us diversification is the most conservative strategy of all this is especially true when that asset class is uncorrelated to the rest of your portfolioprivate technology investments are compelling because• diversification amongst conventional asset classes is rapidly rising equity markets commodities corporate debt are all moving in lock step• private tech companies are growing rapidly by disrupting massive addressable markets while traditional industries have stagnated• their eccentric growth produces compelling returns that are frequently orthogonal to conventional assets                                       source charles schwab investment advisory inc with data from morningstar directmost large funds

to a liquidity event such as a company acquisition or ipo or any other reason the the shares become transferableour structure brings greater speed reliability and efficiency to the secondary market havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what if i only want to buy shares outright and get on the cap table while a startup is private realistically direct transfers typically cannot happen below a minimum check size of  million for our target companies which as mentioned are often valued at more than  billion since boards and management of private companies are naturally protectiveif you’d like more information on casebycase details with transactions above this size please email us at email protected havent found the answer youre looking for contact support are your investments in preferred or common shares we work with everyone from global asset managers to angel investors to employees who are looking for liquidity and diversification and our funds reflect this through a mix of preferred and common shares there’s no single answer to this because the funds are constantly executing additional investmentsit’s worth noting that some of our investors view common shares and early round preferred shares as being quite similar in behavior and economic outcome recent preferred investors don’t usually liquidate so soon after their investment and if they do it will likely be treated as a separate asset in a separate fund with different pricing to account for different economic outcome from common or may be handled as a direct transfer havent found the answer youre looking for contact support after the transaction in cases where the shares are purchased for deferred delivery under a forward contract how do you secure the investment we run identity verification and background checks to ensure the shareholders on the other side are legitimate we acquire credit information and place caps on how much each shareholder can liquidate to limit riskwe conduct a thorough legal review of every shareholders document set with our partnerlevel venture law team assessing whether they own the shares and the compliance with transfer restrictionswe’ve put in place various backup enforcement provisions – with multiple recourses and protections for the investor in the unlikely case of a default eg power of attorney to enforce the contracts we further

after this equidate munich re and other relevant affiliates will pursue enforcement of the contract through the legal process for more information please see our partnership announcement and the insurance overview documentequidate has had a  followthrough rate to date on such transactions havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what happens once the company goes public or gets acquired our investment entity distributes the shares in each fund to investors once it determines that the shares become freely practically and feasibly transferable for any reason a typical case is that the company has gone public or been acquired in exchange for cash andor transferable shares in another company after any lockup or holdback periods havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what happens if the company doesn’t go public our platform typically offers investments in latestage companies in the socalled “preipo” phase these companies often face expectations from employees and investors that they will go public sell or otherwise find liquidity within a reasonable timeframe if not there may be other occasions for company shares to become transferableour funds are set up to operate for  years we expect that to be sufficient in the event that there is no event leading to company share transferability and subsequent distribution of shares in that time there is a provision for a liquidation trust similar to the provision in other private equity or venture capital funds through which we would take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that investors’ interests in the fund are redeemable as expected havent found the answer youre looking for contact support shareholders getting started what is equidate in an environment when companies are staying private indefinitely employees and early investors suffer from a lack of liquidity diversification and transparency we help fix this by providing an online trading and information platform for brokering the offering sale and purchase of private company securities in addition to providing tools to help you learn about track and manage your equitywe collect asks from shareholders such as yourselves who are expressing good faith interest in liquidity these are nonbinding private offers to sell your shares your name and details are not tied to the listing this helps us get an accurate picture of price and volume in each company we gather appropriate investor interest and help put together a transaction our goal at every stage is to do this in a company – and shareholder – friendly manner havent found the answer youre looking for contact support which companies’ shares do you work with here are a few conditions that indicate a high likelihood that we’ll be able to help• venturebacked technology companies• latestage companies typically series e or later  billion valuation or higher or midstage companies typically series b through series d  million –  billion valuation as a general rule of thumb the later the company and closer to ipo the more likely investors are to be interested• rapidly growing companies andor business models with proven unit economics with sufficient presence in the press so that investors are able to make a more informed investing decision• incorporated in the us or one of a handful of international companies that are proactive in facilitating secondary transactionsresource constraints prevent us from doing full justice to more companies at the moment but we are continually expanding further into the midstage space and working on adding international companies please feel free to express interest by placing an ask and we’ll be happy to contact you once we’re able to help havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what kinds of equity do you work with we work with owners of shares in mid and latestage private companies in the case of employees and advisors this is typically common stock for investors this is preferred stock purchased in a prior funding roundsome examples we of equity we have worked with common stock acquired through a stock grant stock acquired through exercise of vested options advisor shares preferred shares purchased in an equity financing round etcsome examples of usually ineligible equity unexercised options unvested options unvested stock convertible debt restricted stock units rsus havent found the answer youre looking for contact support i’m located abroad can you help with my shares sure as long as your company is one we can work with and various compliance requirements can be fulfilled eg background checks your location should not be an issue havent found the answer youre looking for contact support preparing for the transaction i’ve submitted my documents for review what are the next steps the document review only happens when the transaction is ready for a match and entering the closing process if you have placed an ask along with the documents please rest assured that you are in our system and investors are able to express interest in shares of your companyas soon as were able to include you in our next round we’ll definitely follow up with you havent found the answer youre looking for contact support how often do you hold roundshow long will it be until i get liquidity for mature latestage private tech companies we typically hold a closing a few times a month however please note that the frequency of closings for any given company does depend on investor demandwe assemble the participants for each closing on the basis of asking price date of the ask and the volume we expect to execute if there is a deadline you are facing option exercise deadline tax payments etc please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you in the next closing havent found the answer youre looking for contact support how can i increase my chances of receiving liquidity as soon as possible we bring together both the buyers and sellers of securities on price and volume to determine who will participate in each closing and then we confirm the goahead generally speaking lower asking prices flexibility on volume and expressing interest with an early ask all make it more likely we can include you sooner havent found the answer youre looking for contact support at what point am i committed can i change my asking price or number of shares early steps in the process are just indicators of interest and aren’t binding however if there is something we should know please let us know so that we can manage the pipeline accordingly unlike other platforms we don’t impose exclusive engagements or restrictions on our clients we simply function on the basis of transparent and open communication and we ask that you do the sameby the point the transaction documents or rofr right of first refusal notice are triggered or if we’ve had conversations and we are ready to move forward the interest becomes a good faith commitment even if you haven’t signed it yet please note that during the rofrtransfer process there may also be relevant clauses within your company’s agreements to consider if you back out at this stage there are no legal obligations to equidate but it puts us in an awkward position since there are usually other investors and shareholders involved in the same round which creates significant process and relationship issues for us if someone backs out of their good faith commitments we may decide it is not prudent to work with them in the future and may restrict access to the platform altogetheryour commitment is binding after you sign the relevant transaction documents stock transfer agreement forward agreement etc and the funds transfer process is completed the transaction is considered complete at this point and cannot be reversed except in a short list of extraordinary circumstances havent found the answer youre looking for contact support how do i price this we believe in free fair and open markets equidate relies on market pricing established by investors and shareholders the end prices vary from company to company based on funding stage time since last raise performance growth potential etc we are happy to provide the estimated closing price where known based on recent transactions demand and supply market events such as financing rounds etc but ultimately demand and supply set the priceas of mid for latestage companies that recently raised a financing round we have recently seen shares transacting at a slight discount to the known valuation havent found the answer youre looking for contact support my company is growing rapidly and i’m bullish on our stock what if i think it’s worth more than the estimated price if you are seeking a price above the current estimated round price please feel free to submit it and we’ll notify you ifwhen it’s reached however other interest at lower prices would be filled first and it’s possible that your price will never be reachedit’s not a surprise that you’re bullish on the company most of our shareholders are but a few factors are worth considering as you think about an appropriate price• venture capital valuations are based on the most recent price for preferred stock which carry significant additional protections and more favorable economic outcomes – liquidation preference antidilution protections access to company information etc common stock and early stage preferred stock often merit a discount from the current valuation• funding rounds are usually forward looking and factor in expected future growth over the short term so for example a company whose metrics have xed since a financing event wouldn’t justify a x price since that financing probably already priced in significant growthwe’ve had many many conversations where shareholders expected a high price even for a small fraction of their shares which would have helped them pay off debt or cover tax bills in some cases this worked out but in other cases we saw the market change for example in late  and early  and there was no longer enough investor interest around the company to sustain the earlier price much less a premiumit is of course ultimately your decision and past market experience is no guarantee of future performance but we recommend you consult with a financial advisor if you’re mulling over such a decision havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what fees do you charge each side of the transaction incurs a fee of  on the transaction amount paid to

forward contract some other transaction structure or in some cases a decision that a transaction is not feasible with a direct sale we would follow on the company’s established processes for transferring ownership from you to the buyer usually our holding company this process is usually known as the right of first refusal rofr process for common stock or transfer process for preferred stock please note that we would first get your explicit permission before contacting the company beginning this process or disclosing any of your information or indications of interest with a forward contract equidate’s holding company would sign a forward purchase agreement with you where the contract terms and liquidity occur immediately but the delivery of shares occurs in the future after the shares become freely transferable which would happen in an ipo certain forms of acquisition or any instance of liquidity for the shares the company’s cap table is not affected any voting and information rights stay with you as the shareholder of record and the process is greatly expedited  weeks from confirming terms rather than  weeks for the rofrtransfer process there are some special cases from time to time for example if you own an interest in a fund or a holding company that owns company shares depending on circumstances or your relationship with the company we may be able to tailor a special liquidity solution so please contact us with details of your specific situation in other cases the stockholder documentation prevents any of the above approaches in such situations unfortunately we usually cannot help havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what if i have transfer restrictions on my stock we are completely committed to ensuring that we are compliant with transfer restrictions for every transaction that we facilitatein each case once we have the terms of a transaction agreed upon in principle we conduct a comprehensive review of all relevant documents before confirmation or execution we do this whether it’s a former employee or investor even when we’ve worked with the company’s shares before since transfer restrictions for a given company do change over time we want to pursue the smartest and most prudent decision in every casein the majority of cases we have encountered we have been able to help with either a direct sale or forward contract in the minority of cases where the restrictions are too onerous and prevent a transaction we regret that we cannot proceed havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what is the typical process for a direct sale the first step is to gather and confirm investor interest depending on the company this can take just days for commonly transacted companies or several weeks for companies where we have infrequent transactions or when there happens to be a dip in investor interest in the companyafter terms are confirmed the process usually takes  weeks• we’ll work with you and your company’s lawyers to gather and finalize the required documents relevant shareholder documents rofr template and any template stock transfer agreement• you would submit the notice of rofrtransfer with the transaction terms to the company• at the end of the required period if applicable often  days or longer the company would notify you whether the rofr is waived or the rofr is exerciseda if waived or if it’s a transfer with no rofr then we would sign a stock transfer agreement accepted and acknowledged by the company once our brokerdealer reviews the details for compliance and completeness the transaction would enter closing and you would receive the wire with the appropriate amountb if exercised you would receive the proceeds from the sale from the company instead havent found the answer youre looking for contact support what is the typical process for a forward contract transaction the first step is to gather and confirm investor interest depending on the company this can take just days for commonly transacted companies or several weeks when there is a dip in investor interest in the company or for companies where we have infrequent transactionsafter terms are confirmed the process usually takes  weeks we’ll review your shareholder documents to make sure our documents are compliant please submit all the documents requested on the platform that you have and any others that are relevant as well we need to complete a thorough review for compliance and risk purposes and incomplete document sets can be a significant bottleneck in the process assuming the documents have been reviewed and approved by our legal team we will trigger the transaction documents on the platform shortly after the signatures are completed our brokerdealer reviews the details of the transaction for compliance and completeness we confirm receipt of the funds from the investors and deposit them in your account to close the forward contract transaction finally once we learn or you inform us that the shares have become transferable for example if there is news of an ipo or acquisition we and our independent fund administratorservicer will contact you towards the end of any lockup process to facilitate the delivery of the shares this is relatively quick and will complete the process havent found the answer youre looking for contact support after the transaction if we have a forward contract what happens once the company goes public or gets acquired your obligation to deliver shares is based on the transferability of the shares themselves without regard to events affecting the company two of the most common things that result in transferability are a company’s first public offering after a lockup period typically  months or else acquisition for cash or by a public company once your shares become transferable our operations team will reach out to you to facilitate the transfer of your shares to fulfill the forward contract this is a relatively simple process and well be happy to help you navigate it havent found the answer youre looking for contact support if we have a forward contract what happens there is no ipo or other liquidity event our forward contracts are executed for a year term which is designed to be sufficiently long for a typical venturebacked company our agreements renew one year at a time after that if the shares are not yet transferrable havent found the answer youre looking for contact support if we have a forward contract am i liable for compensating the investor if the shares decrease in value by ipo no you are only responsible for delivery of the agreedupon number of shares to conclude the transaction our investors understand that investments in private companies can be risky and an equity investment can rise or fall in value based on the underlying company’s performance havent found the answer youre looking for contact support if we have a forward contract what happens if i have the opportunity to participate in an internal tender offerbuyback at the company the agreement requires you to transfer an agreedupon number of shares in the future so you will have to own at least that many shares on the date in question to fulfill the agreement please make sure you’re in a position to fulfill this obligation havent found the answer youre looking for contact support fund eq  rra a
