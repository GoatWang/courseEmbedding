financial customer newfocus financial group llc is an independent firm providing comprehensive financial planning and investment management services such as trusts retirements and pension plans to individuals families business owners and professionals as a fiduciary for their clients the company offers services on a fee basis rather than commission led by chief executive officer and cofounder chad burton newfocus was formed in  currently manages over  million in assets and is growing at a rate of  million per month it employs  people with six of its employees holding the certified financial planner cfp designation challenge when newfocus financial was formed it used the help of a local bank however during the financial crisis of  the bank went out of business and the group’s notes were sold to investors faced with looming balloon payments newfocus financial looked to refinance  a major obstacle given the impact the declining economy had on the value of their commercial real estate after the first lender newfocus approached was unable to find a solution for their unique situation chad struck up a conversation with the keybank relationship manager who had helped him finance his personal watercraft their discussion opened doors for both keybank and newfocus allowing the two to start forging a business banking relationship solution since conventional financing wasn’t an option with the collateral shortfall caused by the devaluation of the real estate chad’s relationship manager suggested an sba a loan to help with his business’s needs initially reluctant to apply for such a loan due to the “horror stories” he had heard about the process he soon learned his fears were unfounded keybank’s extensive experience as one of the largest small business administration sba preferred loan lenders enabled chad’s relationship manager to walk him seamlessly through the application the ease with which everything happened impressed chad but not as much as the solution itself keybank’s revised payment plan would actually save newfocus a substantial amount of money what’s more keybank was able to provide newfocus with additional valueadded benefits such as downloadable quickbooks software flexible spending accounts and more results chad and the team at newfocus have been completely satisfied with the level of service and responsiveness they’ve received from keybank and applaud the bank’s ability to move quickly and keep pace with the company’s needs even better the sba a loans did more than just reduce payments for newfocus they actually improved the company’s cash flow  enabling the company to hire four new employees there are even plans to add at least one more person in the near future which will fill their current office space to capacity chad is also excited about the fact that the loans will help with launching two new technology initiatives for the company and allow them to find a new location to support future growth keybank is fully aware of the company’s upcoming needs and is already part of the planning process since keybank is an expert with sba loans they were able to offer a solution and a customer experience that other banks could not pull off keybank knew how to make the process go smoothly for newfocus providing the muchneeded guidance to complete the application process newfocus is now projecting over  million in revenue over the next  months “i heard horror stories from clients about getting an sba a loan but keybank really made the process easy and the fact that they saved us
