made to the nsw dust diseases tribunal in  were brought against companies in the james hardie group prince et al claim that this is due to the range of mining and manufacturing interests that james hardie had throughout its long operating history the australian council of trade unions has estimated that  claims for mesothelioma would be made against james hardie from  onwards with claims expected to peak in  or  at  per year the total number of past and future claims made against james hardie for asbestosrelated diseases is estimated to be more than  of which  will be claimed after  bernie banton am was the widely recognised face of the legal and political campaign to achieve compensation for the many sufferers of asbestosrelated conditions which they contracted after working for james hardie bernie banton suffered from asbestosis pleural mesothelioma and asbestosrelated pleural disease arpd which required him to carry an oxygen tank wherever he went james hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the s though some earlier claims had arisen the proliferation of cases from the s onwards forced james hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous james hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers in  the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer and in march  james hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities as concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos in the mids james hardie developed an asbestosfree fibre cement technology without the dangers associated with asbestos the mrcf and move to the netherlandsedit james hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the s all asbestos operations including the provision of compensation were undertaken by james hardies subsidiaries principally james hardie and coy and hardieferodo later known as jsekarb between  and  james hardie the parent company began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries since renamed amaca and amaba respectively whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the james hardie group in  these two companies were separated from james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry in  prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the ceo and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the mrcf in february  every member of the  board and some

range of mining and manufacturing interests that james hardie had throughout its long operating history the australian council of trade unions has estimated that  claims for mesothelioma would be made against james hardie from  onwards with claims expected to peak in  or  at  per year the total number of past and future claims made against james hardie for asbestosrelated diseases is estimated to be more than  of which  will be claimed after  bernie banton am was the widely recognised face of the legal and political campaign to achieve compensation for the many sufferers of asbestosrelated conditions which they contracted after working for james hardie bernie banton suffered from asbestosis pleural mesothelioma and asbestosrelated pleural disease arpd which required him to carry an oxygen tank wherever he went james hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the s though some earlier claims had arisen the proliferation of cases from the s onwards forced james hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous james hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers in  the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer and in march  james hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities as concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos in the mids james hardie developed an asbestosfree fibre cement technology without the dangers associated with asbestos the mrcf and move to the netherlandsedit james hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the s all asbestos operations including the provision of compensation were undertaken by james hardies subsidiaries principally james hardie and coy and hardieferodo later known as jsekarb between  and  james hardie the parent company began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries since renamed amaca and amaba respectively whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the james hardie group in  these two companies were separated from james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry

move to the netherlandsedit james hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the s all asbestos operations including the provision of compensation were undertaken by james hardies subsidiaries principally james hardie and coy and hardieferodo later known as jsekarb between  and  james hardie the parent company began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries since renamed amaca and amaba respectively whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the james hardie group in  these two companies were separated from james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry in  prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the ceo and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the mrcf in february  every member of the  board and some members of senior management were charged by the australian securities and investment commission asic with a range of breaches of the corporations act  cth including breach of directors duties by failing to act with care and diligence asic also undertook investigations into possible criminal charges against the companys executives but in september  the commonwealth director of public prosecutions decided there was insufficient evidence and charges were not pursued in  the supreme court of new south wales found that former chairwoman meredith hellicar and exdirectors michael brown michael gillfillan martin koffel dan obrien greg terry and peter wilcox had misled the stock exchange in relation to james hardies ability to fund claims they were also banned from serving as board members for five years former chief executive peter macdonald was banned for  years and fined  for his role in forming the mcrf and publicising it the former directors excepting macdonald appealed and the nsw court of appeal subsequently overturned the ruling against these directors in  asic appealed against the ruling in the high court of australia in

focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these

cement sheet and other related building products which used asbestos as a reinforcing material james hardie was one of a number of companies involved in the mining of asbestos and by the middle of the twentieth century had become the largest manufacturer and distributor of building products insulation pipes and brake linings containing it in australia it ran asbestos plants in new south wales south australia victoria queensland and western australia working with the products containing asbestos  including the building material known as fibro  caused people to develop various pleural abnormalities such as asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma in december  the company shareholders unanimously voted to restructure and relocate the company in the netherlands as a parent company this was part of a strategy to separate the company from the stigma of its asbestos liabilities on  february  james hardie moved its corporate domicile from the netherlands to ireland in a transaction designed to transform james hardie industries nv into an irish societas europea company and james hardie industries nv became james hardie industries se the final stage of the move was completed on  june  asbestos products and controversyedit historyedit see also wittenoom gorge western australia in  the effects of pleural abnormalities and other asbestosrelated diseases were beginning to show up in the former mine workers journalist catherine martins frontpage story for the west australian won a walkley award and she produced a series of another nine articles highlighting the impact on

notably csr limited more than  of claims made to the nsw dust diseases tribunal in  were brought against companies in the james hardie group prince et al claim that this is due to the range of mining and manufacturing interests that james hardie had throughout its long operating history the australian council of trade unions has estimated that  claims for mesothelioma would be made against james hardie from  onwards with claims expected to peak in  or  at  per year the total number of past and future claims made against james hardie for asbestosrelated diseases is estimated to be more than  of which  will be claimed after  bernie banton am was the widely recognised face of the legal and political campaign to achieve compensation for the many sufferers of asbestosrelated conditions which they contracted after working for james hardie bernie banton suffered from asbestosis pleural mesothelioma and asbestosrelated pleural disease arpd which required him to carry an oxygen tank wherever he went james hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the s though some earlier claims had arisen the proliferation of cases from the s onwards forced james hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous james hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers in  the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer and in march  james hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities as concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos in the mids james hardie developed an asbestosfree fibre cement technology without the dangers associated with asbestos the mrcf and move to the netherlandsedit james hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the s all asbestos operations including the provision of compensation were undertaken by james hardies subsidiaries principally james hardie and coy and hardieferodo later known as jsekarb between  and  james hardie the parent company began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries since renamed amaca and amaba respectively whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the james hardie group in  these two companies were separated from james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry in  prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the ceo and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the mrcf in february  every member of the

duties by failing to act with care and diligence asic also undertook investigations into possible criminal charges against the companys executives but in september  the commonwealth director of public

hardie group prince et al claim that this is due to the range of mining and manufacturing interests that james hardie had throughout its long operating history the australian council of trade unions has estimated that  claims for mesothelioma would be made against james hardie from  onwards with claims expected to peak in  or  at  per year the total number of past and future claims made against james hardie for asbestosrelated diseases is estimated to be more than  of which  will be claimed after  bernie banton am was the widely recognised face of the legal and political campaign to achieve compensation for the many sufferers of asbestosrelated conditions which they contracted after working for james hardie bernie banton suffered from asbestosis pleural mesothelioma and asbestosrelated pleural disease arpd which required him to carry an oxygen tank wherever he went james hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the s though some earlier claims had arisen the proliferation of cases from the s onwards forced james hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous james hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers in  the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer and in march  james hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities as concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos in the mids james hardie developed an asbestosfree fibre cement technology without the dangers associated with asbestos the mrcf and move to the netherlandsedit james hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the s all asbestos operations including the provision of compensation were undertaken by james hardies subsidiaries principally james hardie and coy and hardieferodo later known as jsekarb between  and  james hardie the parent company began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries since renamed amaca and amaba respectively whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the james hardie group in  these two companies were separated from james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry in  prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the ceo and other senior executives for making fraudulent

james hardie and acquired by the medical research and compensation foundation mrcf which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for hardies asbestos liabilities then ceo of james hardie peter mcdonald made public announcements emphasising that the mrcf had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that james hardie would not give it any further substantial funds indeed the net assets of the mrcf were a million mostly in real estate and loans and exceeded the best estimate of  million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by james hardie the jackson report found that this best estimate was wildly optimistic and the estimates of future liabilities was far too low after this separation james hardie moved offshore to the netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders to make this move the company had to assure australian courts as it was listed on the australian stock exchange that the mrcf would be able to meet future liabilities the courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to mrcf obliging the new dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed the value of the call at the time was  billion the move to the netherlands therefore proceeded however the tax benefits which james hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the united states in  and later with the united states signing a new trade agreement with the netherlands in  while the move to the netherlands resulted in tax savings of us million over seven years in  james hardie had to pay the australian taxation office au million after an audit of the  move showed james hardie had violated the income tax assessment act also in  the us internal revenue service alleged that james hardie had not been in compliance with the usdutch treaty since it had been implemented in  and claimed us million in unpaid taxes plus us million in interest and penalties shortly after the move an actuarial report found that james hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach a million the mrcf sought extra funding from james hardie and was offered a million in assets an offer the mrcf rejected the estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to a million in  and then a billion in  the funding shortfall became of increasing concern in  as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in march  james hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund in discussing the shortfall with the mrcf james hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the mrcf and james hardie were separate legal entities inquiryedit on  february  a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the nsw government the findings were very critical of james hardie and its management amongst other findings it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by james hardie which estimated liabilities at a million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by amaca and amaba the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating amaca and amaba from james hardie however the inquiry found that james hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation despite this finding there was immense political and social pressure on james hardie to negotiate a compensation deal governments were boycotting james hardie products and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on a black ban of james hardie products following the results of the inquiry james hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of james hardies products in december  james hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund the details of the fund were to be legally determined by june  but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised further conflicts between the company and the then federal government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed it was not until november  after the federal government had created black hole tax legislation which made the contributions of james hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible and had granted the voluntary fund taxexempt status that james hardie finalised the compensation deal there was immense pressure on the federal government from state governments union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem sexton claims that the federal government agreed to these conditions to avoid being seen as blocking the compensation the final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by james hardie shareholders in february   of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later legal actions against managementedit after the inquiry in  prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the ceo and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the mrcf in february  every member of the  board and some members of senior management were charged by the australian securities and investment commission asic with a range of breaches of the corporations act  cth including breach of directors duties by failing to act with care and diligence asic also undertook investigations into possible criminal charges against the companys executives
