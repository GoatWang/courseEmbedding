resources light water etc… resulted in as much as  bushels per acre yield loss this is certainly not a small matter the difficult part is identifying areas in the field where weed pressure exists conventional scouting methods can certainly find instances of weed pressure but it is extremely difficult to see each and every part of each and every field from an economic perspective one of if not the most economical and effective means of identifying weed pressure is with an aerial image especially an ndvi the below set of images shows that there is a variation in the field at first glance it looks like a very small portion of the field is extremely “healthy” as shown by the dark green color in the image upon further investigation in the field the scout found that there was indeed

over  million acres are under irrigation it can be quite expensive to irrigate so ensuring the water gets applied properly is essential as the university of nebraska lincoln puts it “the objective of irrigation management is to provide supplemental water needed by the plant while maximizing the value of water” in order to “maximize the value of water” the grower needs to know that the water is being applied properly determining if there are issues with the application of water is sometimes difficult to determine during the extremely busy growing season one economic and efficient method to monitoring the application of water is the utilization of aerial imagery below is an ndvi of a field under pivot irrigation this image was taken in the summer of  and immediately showed both the agronomist and irrigation manager that nozzles were clogged and not supplying water to the field knowing this information enabled the expedient repair to the nozzle so the proper amount of water could then be applied caption idattachment alignaligncenter width ndvi image of field under pivot irrigationcaption caption idattachment alignaligncenter width ndvi of field under hose irrigationcaption
