the dust has settled after xerox corp nyse xrx announced another poor quarter its share price hovers around a week low someone has to be accountable for the catastrophe that has continued to destroy the lowtech company but who ann n reese acts as the lead director of xerox in that position the cofounder of the center for adoption policy has as much a voice in the fate of drowning ceo ursula m burns as any other member of the board the board knows as well as any other group that burns has continued to cripple xerox as its financial results have deteriorated for years reese is also the longestserving director at xerox after her appointment in  burns joined the board in  the year she was appointed president burns became ceo in  and chairman in  reese has had the chance to watch burns reese also has been a party to the approval of burns’s extravagant compensation which reached  million in  the xerox proxy defines the job reese holds our lead independent director’s responsibilities include presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors calling special meetings of the independent directors as needed addressing individual board member performance matters as needed and serving as liaison on boardwide issues between the independent directors and the ceo as needed under our corporate governance guidelines each regularly scheduled board meeting must include an executive session of all directors and the ceo and a separate executive session attended only by the independent directors this means reese supervises meetings during which the performance of burns is examined that examination to the extent it has gone on has not helped shareholders at all also read  companies losing the most money in an analysis of burns’s recent performance and her comments about the results of the most recently reported quarter  wall st recently wrote burns was upbeat in comments about the most recent period as she usually is no matter what the numbers our earnings are inline with the guidance we provided results in document technology which included the increased impact from foreign currency largely met our expectations several of our services businesses performed well but overall services segment results fell short of our expectations driven by higher implementation costs in certain health enterprise platform accounts hitting guidance is not a badge of honor this is especially true when revenue drops and net profits collapse xerox’s revenue dropped  in the march quarter to  billion net income fell  to  million operating margins were  which xerox management says was off  percentage points from the same quarter a year ago as for its forecast we expect increased currency headwinds softer signings and acquisition timing to impact revenue and services margin to be impacted by increased implementation costs in legacy health enterprise accounts as a result we are adjusting our full year expectations burns became xerox’s ceo well over five years ago she engineered the buyout of affiliated computer services which cost xerox  billion meant to help xerox move beyond its roots in document production it is hard to find evidence that the strategy worked in the past five years xerox shares have risen  while the sp  has moved higher by over  it is time for reese to claim some measure of responsibility and credibility and to press for burns to leave note
