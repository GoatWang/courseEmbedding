fred’s announced board changes alden issues statement in response to freds announced board changes disappointed that the company refused to work in good faith with alden to reconstitute the boardbelieves board changes are inadequate and designed to maintain the troubling status quoreinforces aldens belief that the board cannot be trusted to lead freds and act in the best interests of shareholders at this critical junctureexpresses concern with the companys unacceptable operating performance and unwarranted dilutive equity issuance news provided by alden global capital llc mar    et share this article new york march   prnewswire  alden global capital llc together with its affiliates alden a holder of nearly  of the outstanding common stock of freds inc freds or the company nasdaq fred today issued a response to freds announced appointment of new directors christopher w bodine and peter j bocian and ceo michael k bloom to the companys board of directors the board alden also expressed its concerns with the companys unacceptable operating performance unwarranted dilutive equity issuance to at kearney and the boards failure to provide proper oversight of management heath freeman president of alden issued the following statement for more than two months we have attempted to work cooperatively and privately with freds to reconstitute the board in a manner that we believe is in the best interests of shareholders we have remained patient and respectful of the companys heightened sensitivity around any public communications during the pendency of the deal with rite aid corporation rite aid we are deeply frustrated by the boards decision to reconstitute the board with new candidates including ceo michael bloom rather than work in good faith with its largest shareholder to reach an agreement around board composition  it is quite clear that these changes were only made in reaction to our involvement and were crafted in such a manner to give the appearance that the board is acting reasonably while really seeking to protect the destructive status quo we think it is telling that the board did not proactively seek to refresh the board on its own but rather only as a way to diffuse our efforts to work cooperatively to enhance the board with directors committed to serving shareholders best interests  importantly these reactionary changes do not go far enough to address the significant issues facing the company and in our view are transparent attempts by the company to create the illusion of change to appease shareholders  freds latest maneuver only reinforces  our belief that this board cannot be trusted and that shareholder representation on the board is immediately required to ensure that the companys cost structure resets in advance of any transaction and that the transaction with rite aid is properly managed freds abysmal business decisionmaking and country club environment in the executive suite and boardroom are serving as significant obstacles to maximizing shareholder value the boards delay tactics during our discussions and adoption of a poison pill and defensive bylaws just four days after public disclosure of our ownership stake in freds demonstrate their intention to further retreat inward from the alarming reality at freds core business unfortunately these entrenchmentminded actions are just the tip of the iceberg of the corporate governance problems plaguing freds we were appalled to learn the company had issued  class a voting shares to at kearney putting a significant amount of voting stock in the hands of the companys own advisors  this action was irresponsible and unnecessary when the company has the capacity to pay in cash this harmful action taken at the expense of shareholders deceitfully provided at kearney double the disclosed value of its services in the form of valuable freds shares based on the share price on the grant date to us these are signs of a board that is looking to go to war with its own shareholders the company stands at a critical juncture freds business has persistently underperformed as evidenced by poor comparable store traffic declining comparable store sales suboptimal gross margins and bloated sga given the companys lackluster operating performance it is not surprising that freds total shareholder return significantly lags behind its dollar store and pharmacy peers  this poor performance should have been addressed long before the occurrence of any transaction the board and management should be held accountable for its shortcomings  the companys reactive approach to adopting changes as a result of shareholder pressure further underscores the need for independent shareholder representation in the boardroom  when the pressure is off what will keep the board from returning to its past practices of complacent oversight and weak governance it is time for the board to prove it is committed to protecting and enhancing shareholder value  we have made every effort to engage with the board constructively and in good faith to resolve this matter through a private process the entrenchment and dilution needs to immediately cease shareholders deserve directors who will be proactive and work tirelessly to enhance value not ones who appear only committed to doing the bare minimum in the face of shareholder pressure we therefore urge the board to reconsider its uncooperative approach and to immediately engage with us to discuss a real reconstitution of the board despite our clear frustration with the company we remain ready willing and able to continue our negotiations with the board in good faith to reach an amicable resolution  a true board refresh is required and all factors point to that  we nonetheless are prepared to take any and all actions necessary to ensure that the interests of shareholders remain paramount in the boardroom including seeking the election of director candidates at freds  annual meeting of
