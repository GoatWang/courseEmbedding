assets less liabilities divided by the funds common shares outstanding  fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value nav which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website for estimates of

income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change downloads and links to recently posted fund information fact sheet click here to view all the downloads for this fund risk considerations the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a nondiversified closedend management investment company investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost because the fund will invest primarily in securities of nonus issuers which are generally denominated in nonus currencies there are risks not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers nonus issuers are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers an investor may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities the fund will engage in practices and strategies that will result in exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates thus subjecting it to foreign currency risk the funds use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings not fdic insured • not bank guaranteed • may lose
