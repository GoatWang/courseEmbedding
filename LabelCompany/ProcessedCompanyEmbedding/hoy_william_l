searches  pictures  •  bibliographystats  baseball reference  •  retrosheet corrections additions if you can help us improve this players biography contact us dummy hoy this article was written by ralph berger if william ellsworth hoy were playing today he would not be called dummynot by players nor by fans nor by the media hed be bill or billy perhaps will or willie maybe even ellie he wouldnt be a deaf mute either hed be aurally and vocally challenged but back when hoy was playing nicknames were descriptive often to the point of cruelty to hoy his condition wasnt an excuse it was what it was indeed he referred to himself as dummy and politely corrected those who for whatever reason called him william hoy would have been an exceptional man with or without his handicap after his baseball career was over he used his celebrity status to foster the needs and concerns of the deaf he had a zest for life and once walked  blocks at the age of  to see his son judge carson hoy preside in court at that advanced age he also danced the charleston and pruned trees on his farm william ellsworth hoy was born in houcktown ohio on may   his parents rebecca hoffman and jacob hoy were of englishgerman and scottish stock and had a farm in houcktown william had three brothers smith frank and john as well as sister ora contracting meningitis when he was three years old left william deaf and mute hoy entered the ohio school for the deaf in  graduating in  highly intelligent and hardworking he was valedictorian of his high school class in those days many deaf people were either employed or selfemployed as shoemakers or shoe repair people hoy was no exception and in his early twenties opened his own shoe shop during the summer in his hometown many of the rural people went barefoot business would grind almost to a halt then and dummy would play ball outside his shop with the local kids one day a man passed by and saw dummy playing he was impressed but moved on when he found out dummy was deaf the man returned the next day however and asked hoy if he would be interested in playing on the kenton ohio team against its bitter rival urbana hoy accepted the invitation billy hart the urbana pitcher was a professional but dummy had no trouble solving him for some base hits the following day dummy closed his shop and set out for the northwest league in search of starting a professional baseball career some teams turned him down because of his handicap but he caught on with oshkosh in wisconsin in  hoy was a smart fast and alert ballplayer who put together arguably the greatest career of any seriously handicapped player shatzkin and charlton  hoy began his major league career in  with washington of the national league a lefthanded batter and righthanded thrower he played with buffalo st louis cincinnati chicago and louisville when hoy joined the washington ballclub he posted a statement on the clubhouse wall being totally deaf as you know and some of my teammates being unacquainted with my play i think it is timely to bring about an understanding between myself the left fielder the shortstop and the second baseman and the right fielder the main point is to avoid possible collisions with any of these four who surround me when in the field going for a fly ball whenever i take a fly ball i always yell ill take itthe same as i have been doing for many seasons and of course the other fielders let me take it whenever you dont hear me yell it is understood i am not after the ball and they govern themselves accordingly hoys yell was actually a squeak hoy was with buffalo in the players league in  with the st louis team of the american association in  then back with washington in the national league in  and  he moved on to cincinnati of the national league in  where he stayed until going to louisville of the national league in  and  he then played for chicago of the american league in  and  he spent one more season with cincinnati in  and finally ended his baseball career with los angeles of the pacific coast league in  hoys moving around made him one of  players to play in four major leagues all told hoy played in  games with an average of  that included  hits  runs  homers and  runs batted in possessing great speed he is credited with  steals however it is difficult to compare him to modernday players because during his time going from first to third or second to home on a single was considered a steal this rule was in effect from  to the end of the  season nevertheless hoys ability to take the extra base shows he was an outstanding runner a small man standing only   inches tall and never weighing more than  pounds he gave all he had in his small stature hoy is one of three outfielders to throw out three base runners at home plate in one game on june   he threw perfect strikes to catcher connie mack to throw out runners attempting to score from second base in  with the white sox hoy had  assists he has a career mark of  assists see note tommy leach hoys roommate in  said we got to be good friends he was a real fine ballplayer when you played with him in the outfield the thing was that you never called for a ball you listened for him and if he made this little squeaky sound that meant he was going to take it leach went on to say we hardly ever had to use our fingers to talk though most of the fellows did learn the sign language so that when we got confused or something we could straighten it out with our hands some historians credit hoy with umpires using hand signals for balls and strikes and safe and out calls but their view is open to question bill deane challenges that claim deane said we can find no contemporary articles about hoy or even any written while he was alive that claim a connection between hoy and the umpires hand signalsmuch less any claim by hoy himself bill klem a showboating umpire who began his umpiring career two years after hoy retired is officially credited with inventing hand signals as noted on his hall of fame plaque hoy was directly involved in a funny situation when he was with the washington club the team was scheduled to play an exhibition game in paterson new jersey but the traveling secretary forgot to make a special note of it to hoy when the team was rounded up for the train trip to paterson dummy was among the missing a few players went up to his room to see what was the matter loud knocking and raised voices of course were of no avail one little guy tried to squeeze inside the transom but couldnt get through the players tried to squeeze a bellboy over the transom but he was too big to hoist over then the players threw several plugs of tobacco at hoy hitting him in the shoulder but also to no avail a pack of cards went into effect as they sailed all around hoy still no response finally a set of keys was sent through the transom tied to a bed sheet and dragged across hoy until it caught in his night shirt whereupon he sleepily awoke to find a bunch of playing cards lying all over him thinking his mates were playing a trick on him he quickly grabbed a pitcher of water and flung it at the heads peeping at him from the transom apologies and explanations followed but from then on hoy was always informed of any changes that were to occur a historic moment came about on may   when luther haden dummy taylor pitching for the giants faced dummy hoy of the cincinnati reds when hoy came to bat for the first time he greeted taylor by hand signing im glad to see youand then cracked a single to center forty years later the two met in toledo during the ohio state deaf softball tournament held on labor day weekend in  they were batterymates taylor pitching and hoy catching at the time taylor was  and hoy  on october   hoy married anna maria lowry who was also deaf anna maria became a prominent teacher of the deaf in ohio they raised three children carson carmen and clover two others died during childbirth a third succumbed to the spanish flu carson became a lawyer and a jurist carmen and clover became schoolteachers a caring human being hoy took on the responsibility of raising his nephew whose mother had passed away and whose father was in bad health ora hoy had married elmer helms the marriage produced a son paul hoy helms who would become the founder and sponsor of the helms athletic foundation and helms hall in los angeles the family took care of young paul and dummy hoy lent him money for his education paul graduated from syracuse university in  and settled in california where he became a millionaire through wise investments in addition he founded the helms bakery which financed the olympic committee for the united states in  and  after his retirement from baseball hoy bought a farm in mount healthy ohio where he succeeded as a dairy farmer he also worked for a time as a personnel director for the goodyear tire company when all his children had reached adulthood he sold the farm and made a connection with a book firm and remained there until he was  after retiring from business he continued his involvement in baseball he received a silver pass from both the american and national league presidents and used it frequently he never liked to go to opening day games because he felt there was too much of a crowd he also attended five or six meetings a year of the old timers club in  hoy became the first deaf athlete elected into the american athletic association of the deaf hall of fame a baseball field at gallaudet university in washington dc was named for him anna maria died after several months of illness on september   at age  there has been a push by many people to have dummy hoy elected to the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown but all attempts have failed the th century figure picked for the hall in  was frank selee the manager of the oshkosh team where hoy got his start in baseball in  bid mcphee was the th century player chosen despite the push for hoy hoy supporters asked whats mcphee have that hoy doesnt since  the usa deaf sports federation has been lobbying to get hoy into the hall of fame joan sampson hoys granddaughter living in cincinnati said im sure my grandfather would love to be in cooperstown he was very proud of his career but she felt his chances of entering the hall were very slim however in  hoy was inducted into the louisville colonels hall of fame hoy has also been honored by the ohio school for the deaf hancock county sports ohio baseball stars in their time the cincinnati reds and the baseball reliquarys shrine of the eternals in  hoy now  threw out the ceremonial first pitch before game three of the world series between the reds and the yankees in cincinnati he died on december   hoy by living to the age of  was a

receive new items for paintings following follow this search our favorite vintage paintings  the best ways to use them when it comes to vintage paintings some rely on a soulmate factor—you know that gut feeling that a vintage painting was just made for you but if you’re looking to fill an entire home with vintage paintings you might need a game plan that’s a little more well decisive to help we’re sharing a handful of our favorite vintage and used paintings along with tips on how to maximize them in your home nautical landscapes question who wouldn’t love an ocean view thankfully a nautical landscape makes one easier than ever to obtain a category that’s collectively composed of vintage paintings like seascapes and sailboat scenes nautical paintings read like portals portholes into the maritime world thanks to their blueheavy palettes these vintage paintings are easy to factor into virtually any space but we personally love the tranquility they lend to a bedroom while deciding on art for over the bed can be tricky nautical paintings are practically failproof they’re both serene and dramatic perfect for anchoring a large piece of furniture like a bed but the best part about nautical landscapes there’s no need to stop at just one among the most successful not to mention simplest ways to create a gallery wall is by collecting several seascapes and arranging them over a credenza or fireplace mantle while used paintings with no common theme would look messy a collection of vintage seascapes speak the same language making them a perfect match abstracts if you’re looking for a vintage or used painting that will make your room sing try a vintage abstract painting although splashy and stylistically daring an abstract isn’t the kind of vintage panting that will box you into a single “look” in fact these used paintings pair just as beautifully with traditional décor as they do with modern the trick to carrying off an abstract in a traditional space contrasting your colorful abstract with a neutral room or vice versa we also recommend swearing off abstracts with colors that detour too far from the primaries to maintain a feeling of refinement while we love using vintage abstracts in main living spaces there’s really nothing like one in an office or study because abstracts tend to be simpler than landscapes and portraits these used paintings will lend an office a major note of namaste place one at eye level across from or next to your desk and not only will it look great but it will also offer up a hypnotic resting spot for tired eyes portraits from proper nobles to playful midcentury housewives vintage portraits possess roommaking charisma although their intent is often serious vintage portraits speak to our unabashed love of quirk happen upon a vintage portrait in a kitchen and it’s likely to draw out a smile while bumping into one at the end of a hallway will no doubt inspire intrigue but perhaps our favorite thing about vintage paintings is that they’re pros at breaking the rules of art hanging think art must hang on either side of a window not so because a vintage portrait doesn’t take itself too seriously they’re apt for hanging in unconventional spots like under a window or above a doorframe we also love one used in a kitchen adorning open shelving or propped directly on a countertop conventional absolutely not but that’s why we love it fruit still life you know how a kitchen just looks better with fresh fruit on the counter if that’s any indication to the power of produce think about selecting a fruit sill life for your kitchen because of their welledited subject matter these used paintings are usually small in scale typically only measuring a few inches in each direction the miniature size however makes them perfect for kitchens where nooks and crannies abound not sure you have nooks think again what about those narrow spaces above your cabinets or behind the sink most likely you’ve ignored these spaces up until now as nothing’s ever seemed quite suitable enough to fill them but what about a fruit still life to further embellish the look try dressing the space with an unexpected detail like a brass rod the brass rod can be affixed to your wall with brackets and simple shooks can then be used to attach your mini used painting to the rod paintbynumber if the mere mention of paintbynumbers already has you cringing let us assure you that these vintage paintings can look remarkably chic a popular hobby that emerged in the s paintbynumbers encouraged those who were notso artfully inclined to try their hand at the brush although it seems hard to believe now paintbynumbers paintings were considered relatively serious décor at the time and in  one even won third place in a prestigious san francisco art contest unfortunately since then these used paintings have fallen into a lessthanserious genre so how does one elevate them back to their former glory well for one keep framing to a minimum a plain gold frame can do wonders for a vintage paintbynumbers as can something as simple as a metal wall clip in these cases don’t even bother framing next when it comes to placing these used paintings choose a casual room like a nursery playroom or a laundry room these rooms typically have happy playful vibes which will lend your used paintings a cheeky all
