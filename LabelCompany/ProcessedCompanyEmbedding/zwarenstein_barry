portfolio of businesses zwarenstein says he had a strong desire to be the finance chief at a public company but his path to that goal was blocked at fmc then that year a cfo opportunity presented itself at logitech the personal computer accessories maker which was preparing to go public but he had to talk his way into the job “logitech took a gamble on me because i’d never taken a company public” he says “i managed to convince them that it was a onetime event and it was more important that i had spent the last  years making systems improvements understanding roi making cost controls doing financial planning and so on they chose me and it was really fortunate for me that it worked out” zwarenstein now runs finance at five his sixth cfo post in silicon valley the company sells

attracted him to five one was the market opportunity  million callcenter agents worldwide almost half of those in the united states  of them working with premisesbased software another was the company’s size — revenue of  million in  just before he came aboard “i like to be in companies that are still a size where you can make things happen” he says then there was the softwareasaservice subscription model which generates recurring revenue and steady sales growth — the topline was up to  million in  and through three quarters this year was about  over last year’s first nine months “having the ability to work with predictable visible revenue streams and tell that story was appealing” zwarenstein says “as opposed to most of my prior career which was systems work that tended to be more lumpy” finally was five’s unique sales proposition it claims to be the only callcenter software vendor whose products are entirely in the cloud though some of the market leaders have added a cloud presence to their onpremises products “this is a huge market and it’s going to shift to the cloud — it’s only a matter of time” zwarenstein says five currently has about  clients that use its service to handle more than  billion customer interactions per year he notes so far large companies haven’t shown a taste for switching wholly to cloudbased call centers but some want to experiment with the concept for a particular call center or campaign it does seem to be a solid concept given that having a virtual call center — in fact five’s core product is called vcc for virtual call center — not only allows a company to avoid buying onpremises software that takes a lot of time to install isn’t very scalable and is difficult to update it also frees the company from having to dedicate space to a call center “all someone needs to be an agent on the five platform is an internet connection a laptop and a headset” says zwarenstein “they can be anywhere” one of the company’s biggest customers is american support a telesales firm that hires many military spouses to make calls the revenue growth isn’t reflected in the company’s stock price which opened at  on tuesday down from a week high of  “there’s been a shift in the market with some distancing over the past few quarters from companies that are not yet profitable” the cfo acknowledges but five’s toplinegrowth achievements — especially because they’re coming at a time when industry generally is having a hard time in that area with profits driven more by cost controls — suggest that investors eventually “will come to fully appreciate the opportunity we have to keep growing and become profitable” zwarenstein says the company which started serving customers in  has told wall street that it expects to be cashflow positive in  or  the longterm goal is to get from the present  margin on a nongaap basis — ie excluding depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation — to  within four and a half years that to be accomplished in part by growing rd and ga expenses more slowly than revenue in turn is expected to drive ebitda to  of revenue zwarenstein says meanwhile zwarenstein ticked off a list of ways companies could trip up an ipo a key one is trying to rush it “this is not the time for a default setting of cost controls but rather a time to get experienced people in support of the audit committee and the ceo” he says he also warns against having insufficient financing to weather the ups and downs in today’s volatile markets “so that you can go out when you want to go out and not when the cash runs out” and danger lurks if company leaders fail to agree on which nongaap metrics to reveal the frequency of doing that and whether they’re going to be quantitative or qualitative “there are lots of ways to mess it up” zwarenstein says leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email  website advertisement popular articles
