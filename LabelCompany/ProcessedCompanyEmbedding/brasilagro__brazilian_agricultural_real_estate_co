investors  brasilagro  brazilian agricultural real estate co adr nyselnd  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»brasilagro is interesting as a small cap play for individual investorsjan  about brasilagro  lnd sven carlin growth at reasonable price longterm horizon book author fund managerglobalgrowthstockssummarythe recent farm sale proves that brasilagro’s business model is healthy and the sale adds lots of liquid assetsunfortunately the traded volume is very low and this disables institutional investors to enterthe company has been growing by  in the last  years and its irr is above  and has practically no debtit is an interesting play for individual investors interested into diversifying their portfolio and betting on a brazilian recoveryin a recent article where i analyzed brazilian stocks traded on the nyse brasilagro  brazilian agricultural real estate co adr nyselnd came up like an interesting stock to investigate business overview lnd is one of brazils largest companies in terms of arable land and its core business consists of the acquisition development operation and sale of rural properties suitable for agricultural activities lnds business model consists of acquiring rural properties that are not fully developed or not developed at all transform them into profitable agricultural land and then sell the properties at a profit the company was founded in  and since then it has acquired  farms and sold  the core of their business model is the land price appreciation coming from the transformation of the property lnd has properties in the following places figure  lnds property portfolio source lnds ir ownership structure an indication that lnd is not a small obscure agricultural company in brazil can be found in its ownership structure figure  figure  lnds ownership structure source lnds ir a  owner is cresud sacif y a nasdaq cresy and having a name like jp morgan nysejpm adds to the general credibility the owner of cresy is the greatest argentine real estate and land developer eduardo elsztain elsztain is also lnds chairman volume issue on nyse one important issue that prevents a substantial investment or lowers the liquidity of the stock is the trading volume on nyse the following figure demonstrates the low volume and purchasing possibilities for lnd figure  lnds daily trading volume source yahoo finance the low volume puts lnd off the list for institutional investors but keeps it interesting for individual investments the number of shares traded on the brazilian stock exchange is a little bit better but not much better with the daily average being  thousand shares valuation via the analysis of the last sold farm  cremaq in order to estimate lnds potential and to find out future potential values before i do a financial analysis i will analyze the last transaction lnd did cremaq was bought in  for r  million and has a total of  hectares of those  were sold in  and the rest was sold recently the sale price is r  million and has generated an internal rate of return nyseirr of  the net value on lnds books was r  million in total lnd has acquired  hectares of which  arable developed more than  hectares and sold  hectares of which  hectares arable the irr from the sales was from  to  after the sale of cremaq lnd still owns a total of  hectares  hectares of which under production and  hectares in a land bank adding up to a total of  arable hectares plus  hectares of legal reserves and permanent preservation areas as the price paid for cremaq was around  per hectare we can assume a similar price for the remaining arable land the  thousand remaining arable hectares would give a total value of r billion or r per share that would be  usd as there is more land to still be developed that future increase in arable land can be used as a discount rate to make calculations simple as only  of the assets are financed by liabilities and only  of the assets by long term liabilities the above values can be used at face value on the financial and growth side lnd has seen revenue grow by  per year and nothing indicates that this growth will not continue in the future due to the last farm sale the current pe ratio is  probably next year it will not be that low but when the next farm sale happens such a scenario cannot be excludes as the company is growing rapidly and the business model is proven to be healthy with no debt investors that are long term oriented and see this as a healthy addition to their portfolios could grasp healthy long term returns figure  lnds land ownership growth source lnds ir the share buyback program lnd has a very interesting buyback program as it has an authorization to buy back almost  million shares on the market in the next  months this buyback program has been increased since the cremaq farm sale increased liquid assets the total buyback should be around  of the company the buyback has been opportunistically increased but still if the internal return rate is  and the book value is  more could have been done on that aspect but the  buyback does limit the downside conclusion i will not be buying lnd because the risks related to the brazilian economy are too high for an estimated  return somewhere in the future even if the growth is very tempting the low liquidity of the stock also does not inspire and i do not see a high premium attached to that but lnd could be interesting for individual investors that want to diversify into brazilian agriculture and also grasp the potential reversal in the countrys economic fortunes do not forget that you would be investing alongside one of the most successful argentine investors eduardo elsztain also this is a company where future sales could keep the pe ratio on the current low levels that means that the return on investment could be more than  in a few years disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it
