units sold to our sponsor pbf energy the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions pbfx chief executive officer thomas nimbley said the acquisition of the east coast terminals is pbfxs first thirdparty acquisition adds meaningful thirdparty feebased revenue and represents an attractive acquisition multiple the addition of the east coast terminals increases the partnerships total capacity by over  to approximately  million shell barrels and diversifies its customer and asset base we expect the acquisition to be accretive to distributable cash flow upon closing mr nimbley continued pbf logistics has been able to execute its strategy and deliver growth to our unitholders pbf energy as a sponsor is committed to the continued growth and strategic development of pbf logistics we are excited about the transaction and look forward to welcoming the east coast terminals employees and customers to the pbf logistics family located in the philadelphia market the east coast terminals are ideally situated in the sixth largest metropolitan area in the united states with significant local demand for refined products  the terminals provide a critical link for the approximately  million barrels per day of refining capacity located within  miles of the terminals and associated downstream demand  with extensive pipeline truck and deepwater marine connectivity the east coast terminals have the flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of potential customer requirements    the east coast terminals are expected to allow pbf logistics to leverage its expanded footprint and capitalize on commercial opportunities with new customers and leverage opportunities with pbf energy due to the close proximity of pbf energys east coast refining system in conjunction with the transaction the partnership expects to invest approximately  million from cash on hand to improve infrastructure in order to increase throughput capability at the east coast terminals based on a total transaction cost of  million including the  million investment and synergy opportunities the partnership expects the east coast terminals to generate approximately  million of pro forma ebitda of which approximately twothirds is expected to be from thirdparty customers the assets to be acquired include a total of  product

                 add interest expense net and other financing costs          pro forma ebitda                                                                                the partnership defines ebitda as net income loss before net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense ebitda is a nongaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unit holders our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities the partnerships management believes that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income operating income cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income additionally because ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utility due to the forwardlooking nature of forecasted ebitda information to reconcile forecasted ebitda to forecasted cash flow from operating activities is not available as management is unable to project working capital changes for future periods at this time about pbf

rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too
