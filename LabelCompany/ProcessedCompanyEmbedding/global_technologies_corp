sold regardless of the number of shares sold we expect to incur offering expenses estimated at approximately  consisting of  for legal accounting and  of other costs in connection with this offering estimated transfer agent fees the table below shows the intended net proceeds from this offering that we expect to receive for scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares since we are making this offering without any minimum requirement there is no guarantee that we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus accordingly the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this offering if any may differ none of the proceeds from this offering will be used to pay the salaries to our officers and directors percent of net proceeds received   6      shares sold  6   gross proceeds  6       less offering expenses             net offering proceeds         if the company raises  or  it will not raise sufficient funds to cover the offering expenses at   it will just have enough funds to cover the offering and no funds for further activity the use of proceeds set forth below demonstrates how we intend to use the funds under the various percentages of amounts of the related offering all amounts listed below are estimates   6      general working capital  —  —     application development —    sec compliance fees legal accounting and transfer agent fees     total         our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses and transfer agent fees relating to the offering our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our shares we intend to use the proceeds of this offering in the manner and in order of priority set forth above we do not intend to use the proceeds to acquire assets or finance the acquisition of other businesses at present no material changes are contemplated should there be any material changes in the projected use of proceeds in connection with this offering we will issue an amended prospectus reflecting the new uses in all instances after the effectiveness of this registration statement the company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general existence and comply with its public reporting obligations our company estimates that we will need approximately an additional  per year to cover additional expenses for public reporting legal fees accounting auditing and transfer of agent fees the company recognizes that if it does not raise net proceeds of at least  in this offering it will have to seek additional funds to cover these expenses the  in net proceeds that we need to stay in business for twelve months is comprised of i for public reporting expenses ii  for the development of the application and  for working capital while the existing liabilities on our balance sheet also include  in shareholder loans the shareholder loans do not have a fixed repayment date and will not be paid out of the net offering  and the offering costs will also be paid out of the gross proceeds from the offering the net proceeds from the offering will not be used to pay either of these liabilities the company will fail if it does not raise a minimum of gross proceeds of and the director will not be able to fund the company in addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business plan investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds therefore management decisions may not be in line with the initial objectives of investors who will have little ability to influence these decisions there are several applications that are currently available that enable you to scan receipts and other documents to your iphone while most current solutions require a physical receipt our solution will bypass the need to print a receipt by connecting the source of the receipt namely the vendor’s computerized cash register to a bluetoothenabled tablet or secondary device such as an ipad or laptop furthermore these other solutions may offer some competition for global technologies’ front and back office solution the main difference with most of these applications is that they are for the enduser only and require the iphone user to physically take a paper receipt and scan it and then save the file in our case we plan to introduce an integrated solution that manages both the enduser side and the vendor side of the transaction taking the sale receipt directly from the vendor’s cash register to an interim device such as a tablet which will have the ability to transfer the saved file to the purchaser’s iphone via bluetooth or similar technology other solutions that may compete with our solution involve the use of a scanner these devices are well known and readily available in both handheld varieties as well as tabletop versions in both cases again these scanners require a physical piece of paper that is scanned and then transferred usually by a flash drive to a laptop or similar device here too our solution will be different in that no hardware other than the iphone and tablet are required our solution will connect the vendor’s cash register output directly to the customer’s iphone without having to use a physical piece of paper and a physical scanner another aspect of our solution will be the file management module of the front office solution that the enduser will be able to manually install on a smartphone such as an iphone while there are many applications that enable file management on both an iphone and a tablet our solution will involve an integrated solution that receives a file via bluetooth or similar transfer technology and then automatically catalogs that file and stores it on the iphone according to preconfigured criteria such as location file name syntax etc the iphone owner will not be required to do anything other than enable the bluetooth operation of the iphone and accept the connection to the tablet for transferring a file once received our solution will automatically process the file and save it within the front office interface for future handling such as printing emailing viewing etc company description we were incorporated in the state of delaware on july   and are a development stage company our companys business plan involves the development of a software solution that will connect via bluetooth or similar technology our back office software to a tablet or ipad that is connected to the cash register at a wide variety of retail outlets our vendors our plan is to market and sell vendors licenses for our back office software to vendors based upon a vendoryearly service package the back office software will run on a standard tablet connected via bluetooth cable or other technology to the vendor’s computerized cash register vendors will have the option for using other devices such as an ipad or laptop in standard operation after the cash register tallies the total purchase for each client the receipt is saved to the network where it can be accessed at any time for our solution the vendor will configure the cash register to save the receipt to the tablet or other device as detailed above the receipt will automatically be saved in a file with a configurable name to include such elements as the time and date name of the store etc the back office software running on the tablet will archive the receipt it will also transfer it to theapplication running on the end user’s iphone or similar device smartphone the transfer will be accomplished by bluetooth or through use of a cable connection once the receipt is transferred to the purchaser’s smartphone in a noneditable format such as an image or protected pdf format it will be logged into the front office the end user can configure the front office application to store receipts by month location or other customizable settings each receipt will be saved under a unique file name which will should include the date and time stamp one of the main benefits of this solution will be the elimination of a paper receipt once the receipt has been transferred to the purchaser electronically there is no need to print the receipt at the store and it is less likely that the receipt will be misplaced the front office application located on the purchaser’s smartphone will have an interface for the enduser that will enable them to sort view delete or email receipts that have been saved to their iphone in this way the enduser should be able to print the receipt if necessary but avoid printing and save paper if the receipt is only used for reference purposes to promote the solution initially planned for ios operating systems running on iphone and ipad devices the company will create a website from which vendors can purchase the back office and from which users can download the front office application which we believe will be offered at no cost the company will generate income via a yearly service charge to vendors and advertisements that appear while the application is in use while the companys operations will be based in israel we anticipate that our back office solutions can and will be marketed globally the company also expects to build a website which will serve as both a base for marketing as well as offers of customer service the website which has not been designed yet should include a knowledge base with articles detailing use and benefits of the application and may include a partner portal to allow vendors to sign up and get additional technical support regarding setup and configuration of the back office application required to communicate between the store’s computer cash register and the tablet hosting the back office application the company plans to work with an outside development team and web developer to create the guidelines for an initial design or prototype of the full solution including the back and front office parts of the solution and then license the idea to a third party for development global marketing and management at this time we do not anticipate any hardwarerelated requirements other than a standard device such as a laptop or tablet that will connect via usb to the vendor’s cash register and the enduser’s personal smartphone currently planned for ios systems running on iphone devices it is likely that we will have to engage marketing and social media experts to determine the best way to promote the application the website and the brand of our offering in later stages of the development of the product development teams may be needed to assess the feasibility of also developing this solution for androidbased devices such as standard tablets and smartphones we will also need to hire user interface experts to optimize the graphic user interface of both the back office software and the front office application seen by iphone and ipad users in addition to applicationspecific advertising on the website and within the enduser application we plan to monetize the site through several means including topicbased advertisement local national global and corporate sponsors and more while the base service will be free to endusers additional forpay services may be added both on the site and for the vendors cloudbased service accounts can be offered to endusers to enable them to store their records in a place that can then be accessed by their other devices and computers simply by logging into the repository and accessing a secure passwordprotected account our third party licensing partner will need to define the terms of this service in terms of cost length of time the service is offered etc a full set of forpay enduser benefits will need to be discussed with the development agency we hire some of the initially planned features may need to be shifted to later development cycles certain features of the proposed services for both vendor and endusers may not be developed without proper funding  our principal offices are located at maale amos  maale amos  israel our telephone number is 6 our registered office
