resources quality is key to a strong core  brochure find balance in your income portfolio by strengthening your core investable ideas dont lag the agg  about risk active trading risk active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses a lower return and increased tax liability changing fixed income market conditions risk the current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the completion of the frbs quantitative easing program and the “tapering” of other similar foreign central bank actions this eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities “junk bonds” and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities including collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans this could result in the fund reinvesting these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income mortgage and assetbacked securities also are subject to extension risk which is the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments causing the price of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and the funds share price to fall an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and could result in losses to the fund the fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages privately issued mortgagerelated securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements as those with government or governmentsponsored entity guarantee and therefore mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgagerelated securities may have less favorable collateral credit risk or other underwriting characteristics and wider variances in interest rate term size purpose and borrower characteristics municipal securities risk the risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer constitutional amendments legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations voter initiatives and the issuers regional economic conditions may affect the municipal securitys value interest payments repayment of principal and the funds ability to sell the security failure of a municipal security issuer to comply with applicable tax requirements may make income paid thereon taxable resulting in a decline in the securitys value in addition there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities tba transactions risk tba transactions involve the risk of loss if the securities received are less favorable than what was anticipated by the fund when entering into the tba transaction or if the counterparty fails to deliver the securities when the fund enters into a short sale of a tba mortgage it does not own the fund may have to purchase deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale at a higher price than anticipated thereby causing a loss as there is no limit on how much the price of mortgage securities can increase the funds exposure is unlimited the fund may not always be able to purchase mortgage securities to close out the short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price in addition taking short positions results in a form of leverage which could increase the volatility of the funds share price us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions subject the fund to market risk because the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or yield generally available when delivery occurs and counterparty risk because the fund relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction these transactions also have a leveraging effect on the fund because the fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date which increases the funds overall investment exposure and as a result its volatility zero coupon or payinkind securities risk the value interest rates and liquidity of noncash paying instruments such as zero coupon and payinkind securities are subject to greater fluctuation than other types of securities the higher yields and interest rates on payinkind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than loans that periodically pay interest as of  acpsx nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst as of  yieldnbsp

risk including loss of principal and there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met  fixed income securities may be subject to extension risk which is the risk that the issuer will repay their obligations more slowly than the market anticipates in the event market interest rates rise issuers also have the right to pay their payment obligations ahead of schedule in the event market interest rates fall subjecting to prepayment risk  fixed income securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk which is a possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and repay the principal on its debt as interest rates rise the price of fixed income securities falls  foreign securities where permitted are subject to the additional risks of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in political and economic conditions foreign taxation and differences in auditing and financial standards these risks are magnified in the case of investments in emerging markets  us treasuries are direct debt obligations issued and backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the us government guarantees the principal and interest payments on us treasuries when the securities are held to maturity unlike us treasury securities debt securities issued by the federal agencies and instrumentalities and related investments may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  even when the us government guarantees principal and interest payments on securities this guarantee does not apply to losses resulting from declines in the market value of these securities  investments may also be made in mortgagebacked assetbacked securities and taxable municipal securities assetbacked securities generally decrease in value as a result of interest rate increases but may benefit less than other fixedincome securities from declining interest rates principally because of prepayments mortgagebacked securities involve additional risk over more traditional fixedincome investments including interest rate risk implied call and extension risks and the possibility of premature return of principal due to mortgage prepayment which can reduce expected yield and lead to price volatility  investments may also be made in taxable municipal securities  highlights investment strategy offers more balanced exposure to the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index along with greater flexibility and enhanced return potential from investments in higheryielding plus sectors investment objective the strategy seeks to maximize total return consistent with prudent portfolio management investment process includes opportunistic exposure to high yield emerging markets debt and nondollar bonds benchmark bloomberg

investment objectives will be achieved prices of equity securities may change significantly over short or extended periods of time the fund sells securities that it has borrowed but does not own “short sales” which is a speculative technique the fund will suffer a loss when the price of a security that it holds long decreases or the price of a security that it has sold short increases losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short and therefore are theoretically unlimited because the fund invests in both long and short equity positions the fund has overall exposure to changes in value of equity securities that is far greater than its net asset value this may magnify gains and losses and increase the volatility of the fund’s returns in addition the use of short sales will increase the fund’s expenses more information on these risks considerations as well as information on other risks to which the fund is subject such as frequent trading
