company based in south jordan utah the newly formed company took over the bottling distribution and marketing of monavie juice products monavie also owned and operated a charity organization the more project monavie products were sold by nonemployee distributors who were eligible to receive commissions based on product sales individual distributors were encouraged to build their own sales networks by recruiting new distributors to sell the products referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline the recruiter could have in theory received additional commissions based on sales by their downlines products monavie produced a variety of blended bottled fruit juices carbonated energy drinks dietary supplements and dieting products monavie kosher one of the companys juice products was certified as kosher according to jewish dietary laws by the orthodox union of north america and the chief rabbinate of israel product research and physiological context an analysis conducted by contract laboratory chromadex indicated that monavie contained low levels of antioxidant vitamin c and of phytochemicals such as anthocyanins and phenolics associated with antioxidant activity in test tubes monavie promoted that the juice had key polyphenol antioxidants from açai and other fruits in the blend however there is no physiological evidence that any fruit polyphenols have such actions in humans or that oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac has any relevance in the human body research shows that although polyphenols are good antioxidants in vitro antioxidant effects in vivo are probably negligible or absent as interpreted by the united states food and drug administration linus pauling institute and european food safety authority dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value after digestion unlike controlled test tube conditions most polyphenols are not absorbed following digestion and what is absorbed is metabolized and excreted interactions and adverse effects a clinical case report showed an association between monavie ingestion throughout pregnancy and prenatal closure of the ductus arteriosus resulting in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction pulmonary hypertension at birth monavie active may cause fluctuations in blood clotting prothrombin time in patients treated with warfarin or other coumadin blood thinners the case report recommends avoiding this combination distributor earnings around  of distributors made a profit according to monavie executive vp henry marsh quoted from a  deseret news article a newsweek article reporting on monavies  income disclosure statement stated fewer than  qualified for commissions and of those only  made more than  a week more than  were counted as wholesale customers whose earnings were mostly discounts on sales to themselves according to a top recruiter the dropout rate in  was around  an article published in the hartford courant reported that about  of the companys distributors earned an annualized average check of less than  and  took home about  roughly  earned an annualized average check of more than  and just  out of  distributors  took home more than  million according to monavies  income disclosure statement according to a  article in the the salt lake tribune  of monavies distributors earned commission checks in  averaging  a week or less while the companys top seven distributors earned an average of  million a year criticism nutritional value physician andrew weil and nutritionist jonny bowden claimed that the nutritional and health benefits of monavie juice were unproven and that the product was overpriced relative to more costeffective conventional polyphenolrich foods weil and bowden also criticized the product for being sold through multilevel marketing a men’s journal nutritional analysis showed that monavie active juice tested extremely low in anthocyanins and phenolics and that even apple juice which also tested poorly has more phenolics the report also noted that monavie’s vitamin c level was  times lower than that of welch’s grape juice a product priced at a fraction of the cost of monavie for the same serving volume ralph carson the original developer of monavie and the company’s chief science officer cautioned that the juice was expensive flavored water and that “any claims made are purely hypothetical unsubstantiated and quite frankly bogus carson added that he did not know how much açai was in the product misleading advertising and health claims bowden newsweek correspondent tony dokoupil palm beach post reporter carolyn susman and salt lake city tribune correspondent tom harvey commented on the use of misleading promotional testimonials by monavie distributors in which the product was said to prevent and treat a variety of medical conditions harvey also stated that monavies rise based on odds stacked against lowlevel distributors who poured in the billions of dollars that fueled the companys spectacular growth raised questions about the foundations of other companies in utahs nutritional supplement industry in  the us food and drug administration fda issued an fda warning letter

high cholesterol and muscle and joint pain the fda considered the issue resolved after therapeutic claims on the offending website were scaled down in a  forbes magazine article reporters emily lambert and klaus kneale described monavie as a pyramid scheme referencing a video testimonial by distributor louis lou b niles that implied the product could cure cancer company executives had repeatedly acknowledged ongoing problems with monavie distributors making unlawful claims that the juice can treat and prevent diseases in a  newsweek article ceo dallin larsen stated that his sales

juice products monavie also owned and operated a charity organization the more project monavie products were sold by nonemployee distributors who were eligible to receive commissions based on product sales individual distributors were encouraged to build their own sales networks by recruiting new distributors to sell the products referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline the recruiter could have in theory received additional commissions based on sales by their downlines products monavie produced a variety of blended bottled fruit juices carbonated energy drinks dietary supplements and dieting products monavie kosher one of the companys juice products was certified as kosher according to jewish dietary laws by the orthodox union of north america and the chief rabbinate of israel product research and physiological context an analysis conducted by contract laboratory chromadex indicated that monavie contained low levels of antioxidant vitamin c and of phytochemicals such as anthocyanins and phenolics associated with antioxidant activity in test tubes monavie promoted that the juice had key polyphenol antioxidants from açai and other fruits in the blend however there is no physiological evidence that any fruit polyphenols have such actions in humans or that oxygen radical absorbance capacity orac has any relevance in the human body research shows that although polyphenols are good antioxidants in vitro antioxidant effects in vivo are probably negligible or absent as interpreted by the united states food and drug administration linus pauling institute and european food safety authority dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value after digestion unlike controlled test tube conditions most polyphenols are not absorbed following digestion and what is absorbed is metabolized and excreted interactions and adverse effects a clinical case report showed an association between monavie ingestion throughout pregnancy and prenatal closure of the ductus arteriosus resulting in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction pulmonary hypertension at birth monavie active may cause fluctuations in blood clotting prothrombin time in patients treated with warfarin or other coumadin blood thinners the case report recommends avoiding this combination distributor earnings around  of distributors made a profit according to monavie executive vp henry marsh quoted from a  deseret news article a newsweek article reporting on monavies  income disclosure statement stated fewer than  qualified for commissions and of those only  made more than  a week more than  were counted as wholesale customers whose earnings were mostly discounts on sales to themselves according to a top recruiter the dropout rate in  was around  an article published in the hartford courant reported that about  of the companys distributors earned an annualized average check of less than  and  took home about  roughly  earned an annualized average check of more than  and just  out of  distributors  took home more than  million according to monavies  income disclosure statement according to a  article in the the salt lake tribune  of monavies distributors earned commission checks in  averaging  a week or less while the companys top seven distributors earned an average of  million a year criticism nutritional value physician andrew weil and nutritionist jonny bowden claimed that the nutritional and health benefits of monavie juice were unproven and that the product was overpriced relative to more costeffective conventional polyphenolrich foods weil and bowden also criticized the product for being sold through multilevel marketing a men’s journal nutritional analysis showed that monavie active juice tested extremely low in anthocyanins and phenolics and that even apple juice which also tested poorly has more phenolics the report also noted that monavie’s vitamin c level was  times lower than that of welch’s grape juice a product priced at a fraction of the cost of monavie for the same serving volume ralph carson the original developer of monavie and the company’s chief science officer cautioned that the juice was expensive flavored water and that “any claims made are purely hypothetical unsubstantiated and quite frankly bogus carson added that he did not know how much açai was in the product misleading advertising and health claims bowden newsweek correspondent tony dokoupil palm beach post reporter carolyn susman and salt lake city tribune correspondent tom harvey commented on the use of misleading promotional testimonials by monavie distributors in which the product was said to prevent and treat a variety of medical conditions harvey also stated that monavies rise based on odds stacked against lowlevel distributors who poured in the billions of dollars that fueled the companys spectacular growth raised questions about the foundations of other companies in utahs nutritional supplement industry in  the us food and drug administration fda issued an fda warning letter to monavie distributor kevin vokes for violations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act relating to online promotional material claiming that monavie was an effective treatment for inflammation high cholesterol and muscle and joint pain the fda considered the issue resolved after therapeutic claims on the offending website were scaled down in a  forbes magazine article reporters emily lambert and klaus kneale described monavie as a pyramid scheme referencing a video testimonial by distributor louis lou b niles that implied the product could cure cancer company executives had repeatedly acknowledged ongoing problems with monavie distributors making unlawful claims that the juice can treat and prevent diseases in a  newsweek article ceo dallin larsen stated that his sales team can get him in hot water with the feds and that it was next to impossible for the company to investigate distributors suspected of making false claims later in  the company issued a statement acknowledging that many of its distributors perhaps unwittingly violated its advertising policies in a  bloomberg news article monavie executive vicepresident and cofounder randy larsen stated that the company is struggling with independent distributors who promote the juice as a miracle drug dallin larsen and dynamic essentialsroyal tongan limu monavie ceo and founder dallin larsen was a senior executive with an mlm company that sold a similar juice product prior to being shut down by the fda for illegal business practices in  larsen became vice president of sales for dynamic essentials a floridabased company selling a fruit juice called royal tongan limu where larsen claimed to have increased revenue  in  during larsen’s tenure the fda warned dynamic essentials that claims on the company’s website that the juice could treat various diseases such as cancer arthritis and attention deficit disorder

pyramid scheme and team as a pyramid atop a pyramid in which monavie vendors were sold motivational lectures using a multilevel model which were purported to help them increase their sales of monavies products the article proposes that this system takes advantage of ambiguities in the federal trade commissions regulation of pyramid schemes and that only  of members make any money from their

founder noa ries the vie active founder grew up running and swimming laps at bondi beach australia with her father who taught her that “the body only does what the mind tells it to” when he died suddenly in  working out became her therapy and exercise quickly became more about sanity than vanity the following year she left her career in advertising to become a personal trainer late in the day in early  she had an epiphany when she realized she was still in her workout clothes had not had time for a shower and felt really unstylish “i thought to myself – why do i have to make this conscious decision every day between being stylish and being fit surely i can be both but as a modern woman with two kids i don’t have time for five outfit changes during the day” the following year vie active was launched with a mission to fuse performance and style vie active was built to enable empower and inspire women to put their oxygen mask on first and fully embrace the benefits of living an active life as a mother a wife entrepeneur and an executive “i realized a few years ago that working out is the reason i’m able to do and be all those things i realized i have to ‘put my oxygen mask on first’ working out makes me more productive focused happier and confident and i want to inspire and enable you to enjoy the same” the product vie active pairs the highest quality performance
