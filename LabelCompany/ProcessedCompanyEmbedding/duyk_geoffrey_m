cardiovascular disorders the identification of genes sequence variations and mechanisms involved in complex human disorders holds great promise for improving health care but at the same time presents a difficult challenge to the scientific communityto better understand the genetics of complex human disorders dr sheffield’s laboratory has studied isolated human populations and mendelian singlegene disorders that share a phenotypic component with common complex disorders he has used isolated human populations to map more than  disorders and has used positional cloning methods to identify  diseasecausing genes this work has provided insight into the types of genes mutational events and gene product interactions that are likely to contribute to common complex disorders recent progress in the laboratory has resulted in the identification of genes involved in a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder known as bardetbiedl syndrome bbs most recently dr sheffield’s lab identified
