nonus holder of our common stock will be subject to us federal withholding tax at a rate of  of the gross amount of the dividends or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty nonus holders will be entitled to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on dividends as a result of either a an applicable income tax treaty or b the dividends being received by the nonus holder in connection with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states to claim such a reduction in or exemption from withholding the nonus holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed a irs form wben or wbene claiming an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the united states and the country in which the nonus holder resides or is established or b irs form weci stating that the dividends are not subject to withholding tax because they are effectively connected with the conduct by the nonus holder of a trade or business within the united states as may be applicable these certifications must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of dividends and may be required to be updated periodically nonus holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the irs if dividends paid to a nonus holder are effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states and if required by an applicable income tax treaty the nonus holder maintains a permanent establishment in the united states to which such dividends are attributable then although exempt from us federal withholding tax provided the nonus holder provides appropriate certification as

though the individual is not considered a resident of the united states such a nonus holder generally will be required to file a us federal income tax return with respect to such gains and losses with respect to the third bullet point above we believe we are not currently and do not anticipate becoming a usrphc because the determination of whether we are a usrphc depends on the fair market value of our usrpis relative to the fair market value of our other business assets and our nonus real property interests however there can be no assurance we are not a usrphc or will not become one in the future even if we are or were to become a usrphc gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a nonus holder of our common stock will not be subject to us federal income tax if such class of stock is regularly traded as defined by applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market and such nonus holder owned actually or constructively  or less of such class of

with respect to payments of dividends on our common stock provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know such holder is a united states person and the holder certifies its nonus status such as by providing a valid irs form wben wbene or weci or other applicable certification however information returns will be filed with the irs in connection with any dividends on our common stock paid to the nonus holder regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld copies of these information   s table of contents returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the nonus holder resides or is established information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of our common stock within the united states and information reporting may although backup withholding generally will not apply to the proceeds of a sale of our common stock outside the united states conducted through certain usrelated financial intermediaries in each case unless the nonus holder certifies under penalty of perjury that it is a nonus holder on irs form wben wbene or other applicable form and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a united states person or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a nonus holders us federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the irs additional withholding tax on payments made to foreign accounts withholding taxes may be imposed under the code provisions commonly known as the foreign account tax compliance act fatca on certain types of payments made to nonus financial institutions and certain other nonus entities specifically a  withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or a nonfinancial foreign entity each as defined in the code unless  the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations  the nonfinancial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial united states owners as defined in the code or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial united states owner or  the foreign financial institution or nonfinancial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules if the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in  above it must enter into an agreement with the us department of the treasury requiring among other things that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified united states persons or united states owned foreign entities each as defined in the code annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold  on certain payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders nonus governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the united states and additional nonus governments are expected to enter into such agreements to implement fatca in a manner that alters the rules described herein withholding under fatca generally will apply to payments of dividends on our common stock regardless of when they are made however under the applicable treasury regulations and administrative guidance withholding under fatca generally will only apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on or after january   if a dividend payment is both subject to withholding under fatca and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under distributions the withholding under fatca may be credited against such other withholding tax

that our board of directors could without further stockholder authorization issue to increase the number of outstanding shares issue with super voting special approval dividend or other rights or

provisions of the certificate of incorporation if carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than  of our common stock the foregoing provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first consult with our board of directors to negotiate the terms of any proposed business combination or offer the provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights however such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and as a consequence they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management delaware takeover statute subject to certain exceptions section  of the delaware general corporation law dgcl prohibits a delaware
