the gangsters daughter writer susan berman whose devoted circle of intimates included realestate scion bobby durst didnt discover her roots as a mafia princess until a freewheeling stint at new york in the seventies her father died of natural causes but she was murdered ganglandstyle in la just before christmas  leaving questions worthy of one of her own mysteries by lisa depaulo sharethis on december th five days before police found her body susan berman was talking on the phone with actress kim lankford one of her closest friends some of what she said is so disturbing in retrospect that lankford is tormented by the fact that she didnt ask more questions but conversations with susan were almost always filled with breathless drama if she was up you knew it if she was down you knew it either way you knew the details that was susan that night lankford was packing for a cruise for the first time in years the two wouldnt be spending part of the holidays together kim felt guilty about that but susan assured her theyd have plenty of time to celebrate when she returned and besides she might have big news by then i have information thats going to blow the top off things susan told her what do you mean kim asked what information well i dont have it myself said susan but i know how to get it well be careful for gods sake said kim susan promised they would talk more after the holidays it wasnt unusual for her to be about to get information she was a journalist and she was working on three big projects  two book ideas and a television pilot two had to do with las vegas where susan had spent her childhood as a mobsters daughter a subject that haunted all of her work as well as her life so kim assumed it was something about that when she hung up kim thought to herself who cares who killed bugsy siegel at another point in the conversation susan said shed just talked to a psychic this too wasnt unusual psychics were among the few things susan had faith in she had regular phone consultations for over fifteen years with her psychic in new york but it seemed she had seen a new one recently in la she told me i was going to die a violent death and that thered be a gun involved susan said oh susan kim remembers thinking less than a week later at  pm on christmas eve the los angeles police were called to susans rundown home on benedict canyon road by neighbors whod grown alarmed that one of her three wirehaired fox terriers  so precious to her such a nuisance to others  was running wild and barking hysterically susan would never have left lulu unattended for so long the cops found the front door unlocked and the back door ajar and followed the bloody pawprints of the dogs to the back bedroom dressed in sweats and a tshirt susan was lying on the cold hardwood floor with a single bullet in the back of her head shed been dead for at least a day when friends made their pilgrimage to  benedict canyon road numb with the news theyd all remember the same grisly detail still on the guestroom floor framed by the pawprints was a clump of susans lustrous long black hair  her friends used to tease her that she kept the same sleek style always with bangs  dried in a puddle of her own blood you couldnt help but see it it was all that was left says her friend julie smith a successful mystery writer but no one talked about it no one wanted to go near it it was too awful to contemplate its been over two months now and the mystery of who killed susan berman has only gotten creepier and more complex  the kind of story susan herself would have been obsessed with when news of the killing hit the papers in early january it shocked the literary communities on both coasts from her impressive career at new york in the late seventies and early eighties to her subsequent years in hollywood susan made a vivid impression wherever she went few particularly in creative circles could resist the mob daughter turned journalist with a repertoire of fantastic almost unbelievable life stories she also had a catalogue of bizarre fears and phobias impossible for anyone close to her to ignore she couldnt cross bridges or drive on certain streets she couldnt eat in a restaurant without interrogating the waiters or summoning the chef panicked that she would die from one of her countless allergies and she couldnt go above the third floor in a building unless accompanied by a big strong man and assured that the windows were hermetically sealed her biggest phobia was that she would hurl herself out a window she had her flaws deadpans rich markey a comedy producer in la who was the last friend to see her alive but her friends adored her everyone adored her  in spite of them not because of them and given what shed been through in her  years they also understood them susan had survived the las vegas mob of the fifties and one unbearable loss after another she had almost come through the brutal downward spiral that led her from a life of enormous mob wealth and success as a writer to such financial and emotional despair that she resorted to selling her mothers treasured jewelry through it all she was always susan  complicated tormented irresistibly entertaining the way she dealt with her past was to make it theater says new york times reporter dinitia smith a colleague from her new york days as the years went by that got harder and harder how can i go on she would ask her friends or her bestknown halfthreat im going to get into the bathtub with my hair dryer now those who really knew her well didnt worry too much that shed ever take her own life oh no says kim lankford that was not an option she would never want to miss how it would all play out when the news hit her history as a gangsters daughter dominated the headlines could she have been killed for some mob secret she was about to reveal a dubious theory since most of the characters from susans fathers las vegas days were long dead and when she had written about them it was with a mix of love and fascinated adoration if i were a gangster says markey id have encouraged her to write more the case took a more macabre twist when westchester county district attorney jeanine pirro announced that berman had been on her shortlist of witnesses to interview in yet another eerie case a coast away from susans struggles nineteen years ago kathie durst the estranged wife of realestate heir bobby durst  whose familys durst organization owns more than  million worth of manhattan real estate  had vanished in new york without a trace for nearly two decades  as the pretty medical students friends spoke out about an abusive marriage and battles over money  investigators had their sights on the nowreclusive bobby who happened to have been extremely close to susan berman going back to their days at ucla in the late sixties susan referred to durst who declined new yorks request for an interview as her brother the dedications in her books invariably began with his name it was always bobby this bobby that wonderful bobby  a friend recalls yet when susan tried to reach him last summer to borrow money she was irked to find hed changed his phone number so she wrote to him in care of the durst organization the letter reached its target in the months before her death she had cashed two  checks from bobby in fact susan borrowed a lot of money from a lot of people over the years and always tried to pay it back in this case however she was touched one friend says that bobby had told her the  was a gift      next share this story facebook twitter digg

center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris displacing over  employees the bank recovered quickly and rebuilt its presence trading operations moved across the hudson river to its jersey city new jersey facilities where an impromptu trading floor was built in a hotel and brought online less than fortyeight hours after the attacks when stock markets reopened on september   lehmans sales and trading capabilities were restored in the ensuing months the firm fanned out its operations across the new york city metropolitan area in over  temporary locations the

significantly boosted morale throughout the firm the firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower manhattan following the attacks only deutsche bank goldman sachs and merrill lynch of the major firms remained in the downtown area lehman however pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in new york city that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and morgan stanley was desperate to sell that when the new building was purchased the structural integrity of three world financial center had not yet been given a clean bill of health and that the company could not have waited until may  for repairs to three world financial center to conclude after the attacks lehmans management placed increased

commercial real estate holdings were three times greater than capital in such a highly leveraged structure a  to  percent decline in real estate values would wipeout all capital collapseedit main article bankruptcy of lehman brothers causesedit malfeasanceedit a march  report by the courtappointed examiner indicated that lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end

center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris displacing over  employees the bank recovered quickly and rebuilt its presence trading operations moved across the hudson river to its jersey city new jersey facilities where an impromptu trading floor was built in a hotel and brought online less than fortyeight hours after the attacks when stock markets reopened on september   lehmans sales and trading capabilities were restored in the ensuing months the firm fanned out its operations across the new york city metropolitan area in over  temporary locations the

reevaluating its office plans which would have put over  employees in the times square area of new york city lehman began moving into the new facility in january and finished in march  a move that significantly boosted morale throughout the firm the firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower manhattan following the attacks only deutsche bank goldman sachs and merrill lynch of the major firms remained in the downtown area lehman however pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in new york city that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and morgan stanley was desperate to sell that when the new building was purchased the structural integrity of three world financial center had not yet been given a clean bill of health and that the company could not have waited until may  for repairs to three world financial center to conclude after the attacks lehmans management placed increased

commercial real estate holdings were three times greater than capital in such a highly leveraged structure a  to  percent decline in real estate values would wipeout all capital collapseedit main article bankruptcy of lehman brothers causesedit malfeasanceedit a march  report by the courtappointed examiner indicated that lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were this practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the companys balance sheet however unlike typical repurchase agreements these deals were described by lehman as the outright sale of securities and created a materially misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition in

reduction in goodwill lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space in  lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis lehmans loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lowerrated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages whether lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lowerrated bonds or made a conscious decision to hold them is unclear in any event huge losses accrued in lowerrated mortgagebacked securities throughout  in the second fiscal quarter lehman reported losses of  billion and was forced to sell off  billion in assets in the first half of  alone lehman stock

her dead shot in the back of the head executionstyleher friends would tell investigators that ms berman a downonherluck screenwriter and journalist would never have let her three dogs run free for fear they would be hit by a car speeding down narrow benedict canyon nor would she have opened the door to a stranger but the police found the back door open and the front unlockedsuspicion passed from her landlady with whom she had been feuding to her manager and even to geriatric gangsters from las vegas who might have known her mobster father back in the days of bugsy siegelbut eventually investigators focused on a wealthy man from a powerful new york real estate family whom she had met in college during the s and for the rest of her life regarded as a brother and a kindred spirit robert a durst advertisement continue reading the main story she spoke adoringly of “bobby” and set up some girlfriends on blind dates with mr durst but to a few she shared dark misgivings continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story after all these years mr durst now sits in los angeles county jail awaiting trial for her murder prosecutors say mr durst killed ms berman to prevent her from revealing any of his secrets surrounding the  disappearance of his first wife a case that had been reopened just before ms berman’s death in mr durst and his lawyers insist that he did not kill ms berman and does not know who did he has pleaded not guiltywhile mr durst’s story has become familiar over time ms berman who was  when she died remains a largely unknown figure her friends describe her as a smart funny and skilled storyteller who neither smoked nor drank she enjoyed being the center of attention but was racked by depression and severe fears of heights and bridge crossings“she was an ambitious very talented intelligent but extremely damaged person” said julie smith a mystery writer based in new orleans and the executor of ms berman’s meager estate “she had a fascinating background you never knew what she would say or do”all the while ms berman talked at the pace of an olympic speedskater her trademark look — thick dark hair down to her shoulders and bangs across her forehead that often obscured her eyes — never variedon good days she could sit in front of her computer and write for eight or  hours at a clip but on other days she could not bear getting out of bedher writing — whether it was a  article for city magazine titled “in san francisco city of sin why can’t i get laid” or her  memoir “easy street” of growing up the daughter of a jewish mobster in las vegas — brought her some measure of fame but she spent her final years in poverty desperate to revive her screenwriting career and fending off eviction from her benedict canyon home advertisement continue reading the main story “i see now that susan’s best stories were always those about susan” said carol pogash a reporter who worked with ms berman at the san francisco examiner in the s “her life was the best drama she ever told”when mr durst first came under suspicion many of her friends could not believe it they repeated like a mantra “suzie loved bobby bobby loved suzie”whatever secrets ms berman knew about mr durst she had a fierce mobinfused sense of loyalty to her friends and to mr durst in particular“she felt very close to him” ms smith said “there have been times i thought all kinds of things about bob but i never thought she would’ve ratted him out for any reason”ms berman grew up in the s in las vegas where her father david berman treated her like a princess elvis and liberace sang at her birthday parties she was blissfully unaware until much later of her father’s ties to the mob at the flamingo and riviera hotelsher father died in  on an operating table when she was  her mother gladys was institutionalized and a year later killed herselfms berman met mr durst in the s while attending the university of california los angeles where he was a graduate student there was an instant and powerful bond friends say he was the son of a powerful new york developer and his mother he told her had also died by suicide although members of the durst family say it was an accidentmr durst described ms berman as his best friend for much of his life during a  interrogation by john lewin a deputy district attorney in los angeles who is leading the prosecution of mr durst advertisement continue reading the main story after attending journalism school at the university of california berkeley ms berman worked for the examiner mostly for the style section but she had higher aspirations in  she moved to new york where her articles appeared frequently in new york magazineit was a heady time with ms berman mr durst and their friends frequently making the rounds at glamorous nightclubs like xenon or studio  where mr durst back in new york and working for his father knew one of the owners steve rubellto celebrate the publication of her memoir ms berman held a spectacular party on nov   at sammy’s roumanian steakhouse a lower east side institution known for its frozen vodka and cholesteroldrenched jewish cooking she wore a customdesigned dress and lined the walls with oversize photos of her father and mother“she was jubilant” recalled stephen m silverman a friend and then neighbor of ms berman’sless than three months later in february  ms berman was at mr durst’s side after he reported to the police that his first wife kathleen durst was missing kathie as she was known was only months away from graduating from medical schoolms durst had wanted a divorce the couple’s marriage had descended into a hell of “fighting slapping pushing” as mr durst told the producers of “the jinx the life and deaths of robert durst” a sixpart hbo documentary broadcast in  photo mr durst during a court hearing last week in los angeles he and his lawyers say he did not kill ms berman and does not know who did credit pool

class the next daywith the case generating tabloid headlines ms berman managed his contacts with reporters and fended off bothersome inquiriesms berman had told many of her friends that she was

talk about her friend bob and how his wife had disappeared and i must never write about it” said ms smith the mystery writer “i always took that as a warning” advertisement continue reading the main story the day after ms durst disappeared someone identifying herself as kathie durst called albert kuperman the dean of the albert einstein college of medicine to say she was not feeling well and would not be able to attend classinvestigators in new york and california have long suspected that the call was made not by ms durst but by ms berman the circumstances of that call are of keen interest to the prosecutor in the berman murder caseduring his  interrogation of mr durst mr lewin the prosecutor noted the oddity of the call’s going to mr kuperman who barely knew ms durst instead of to her supervisor at the pediatric clinic where she was working“you didn’t have the name of the doctor and the place she was going to be doing it” mr lewin asked “right”mr durst did not respondmiriam barnes a friend of ms berman’s who lived next door on beekman place in manhattan has her own vivid memory of ms berman at the time ms durst vanished unlike many of ms berman’s other friends she has not been interviewed by investigators from new york or los angelesone afternoon — she cannot recall the exact date after nearly  years — ms berman returned to her apartment building after work and immediately sought her out ms barnes saidms berman was both “very nervous and sad” they sat face to face in chairs in the hallway of ms berman’s apartment as ms berman leaned forward“she said ‘bobby asked me to do something and i did it’” ms barnes said “‘if anything happens to me just remember bobby did it’” advertisement continue reading the main story ms berman never explained her cryptic comment ms barnes said but it stuck with her nonethelessin any event a few years after ms durst vanished ms berman returned to los angeles to focus on screenwritingin  ms berman married a man named mister margulies whom she had met in line at the writers guild while they each registered a screenplay the wedding was a lavish production at the hotel belair an old hollywood hotel that had once housed jimmy stewart lauren bacall and audrey hepburnmr durst walked her down the aisle the film producer robert evans offered a toast “i don’t know mister but i can tell him susan is the most seductive woman i ever met”the marriage did not work out and mr margulies was soon dead of a drug overdosems berman worked relentlessly on a series of book and film projects but by the late s she was in desperate financial shape unable to pay rent or even the mechanic who had fixed her isuzu she scrambled to reach mr durst to ask for money as she had in the past he eventually sent her two checks for  eachin a note to “dearest bobby” dated nov   ms berman seemed to fear that the gift had ruptured their friendship “i don’t want my last request to be the last time we communicate —
