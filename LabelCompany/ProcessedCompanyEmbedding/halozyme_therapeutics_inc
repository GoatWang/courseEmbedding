therapeutics  technology  products  product candidates  pegph email this page homepage»technology  products»product candidates»pegph seeking better waysto beat cancer lead therapeutic candidate pegph is based on halozyme’s proprietary rhuph enzyme rhuph is a recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme which temporarily degrades hyaluronan ha a glycosaminoglycan or chain of natural sugars that accumulate around certain tumors preclinical studies have shown that removal of ha from tumors improves the ability of chemotherapies or immunotherapies to penetrate the tumor inhibiting its growth how does it work certain cancers including pancreatic breast lung colon and prostate have been shown to accumulate high levels of hyaluronan ha this accumulation creates a unique microenvironment that fosters the growth of tumor cells and generates barriers to drug delivery inhibiting the potential effectiveness of many anticancer agents breaking through the ha component of the tumor microenvironment opens previously constricted vessels which may increase blood flow and access of coadministered therapies to the tumor development history halozyme initiated a phase  clinical trial in  to assess pegph over a range of doses and frequencies to assess the safety and tolerability of the treatment in patients with solid tumor malignancies refractory to prior therapies which included patients with pancreatic cancer today halozyme is conducting multiple clinical trials of pegph in patients with a range of previously treated or untreated solid tumor malignancies in combination with both chemotherapies and immunotherapies key events and data timeline for pegph in january  halozyme reported topline results from the combined analysis of stages  and  and stage  alone of its halo study as of december  halo is a phase  randomized multicenter clinical trial of lead investigational drug pegph in combination with abraxane® nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine in stage iv pancreas cancer patients among the findings the primary endpoints were achieved showing a statistically significant increase in progressionfree survival pfs for the efficacy evaluable population and by demonstrating a reduction in the rate of thromboembolic events in stage  of the study in the pegph arm the combined study population showed a statistically significant increase in pfs in the targeted hahigh patient population patients with high levels of hyaluronan hahigh treated with pegph plus abraxane and gemcitabine pag arm when compared to hahigh patients receiving abraxane and gemcitabine ag arm alone stage  of the study which completed enrollment in february  showed a  improvement in median pfs for hahigh patients pfs in the pag arm was  months vs  months in the ag arm hazard ratio with a  confidence interval of    in stage  the overall survival os an exploratory endpoint showed a  improvement in hahigh patients in the pag arm was  months vs  months in the ag arm hazard ratio with a  confidence interval of    in june  halozyme announced results from a analysis as of february  in  patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were treated in stage  of halo  a phase  clinical study of its investigational new drug pegph in combination with abraxane® nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine pag arm as compared to abraxane and gemcitabine alone ag arm this final analysis of stage  secondary and exploratory endpoints was conducted using the ventana companion diagnostic assay to retrospectively identify high levels of ha the key results based on a february  data cutoff showed in the hahigh patient population are as follows median progressionfree survival pfs was  months in the pag arm vs  months in the ag arm hazard ratio with a  confidence interval of    overall response rate orr was  including one complete response in the pag arm vs  and all partial responses in the ag arm median duration of response was  months in the pag arm vs  months in the ag arm the exploratory analysis of median overall survival was similar between the treatment arms   months vs  months in the pag vs ag arms respectively factors potentially having an impact on these results include less aggressive disease among patients in the ag arm and a greater than  discontinuation rate of pegph treatment at the time of the clinical hold resulting in all patients receiving ag alone in both arms the rate of thromboembolic events reduced from  to  in the pag arm and from  to  in the ag arm with the introduction of prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin from stage  to stage  of the study in may  halozyme presented interim findings from the ongoing phase  clinical study of its investigational new drug pegph in combination with abraxane® nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine for the potential treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer at the  american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting the trial included  treated patients in stage  of whom a total of  patients   receiving pegph in combination with abraxane and gemcitabine pag treatment arm and  receiving abraxane and gemcitabine alone ag treatment arm  had available biopsies that were determined in a retrospective analysis to have high levels of ha in december  the european commission acting on the recommendation from the committee for orphan medicinal products of the european medicines agency ema designated pegph as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in october  the fda granted orphan drug designation for pegph for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in august  the fda granted fast track designation for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer using pegph in combination with abraxane® nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine in september  at the european cancer congress halozyme presented exploratory posthoc analysis of progressionfree survival and overall survival of a small subset of patients treated with pegph with available biopsy samples and ha scores in the phase b study both progressionfree survival and overall survival were longer in patients with high levels of tumor ha compared to patients with low levels of tumor ha the observation that patients with tumors characterized by high levels of ha may respond better to pegph has resulted in our effort to develop a companion diagnostic to enable preselection of these patients in june  at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting halozyme presented results from a phase b clinical study of pegph in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with stage iv metastatic pancreatic cancer phase b pegph clinical study the study enrolled  patients with previously untreated stage iv pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients were treated with one of three doses of pegph   and  µgkg twice weekly for three weeks followed by no pegph treatment in week  in combination with gemcitabine  mgm administered intravenously in this study the overall response rate complete response  partial response by recist  criteria was   of  patients  ci  for those treated at therapeutic dose levels of pegph  and  µg kg as assessed by an
