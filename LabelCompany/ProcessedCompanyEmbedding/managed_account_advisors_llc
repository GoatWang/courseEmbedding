stadion stadion retirement managed accountstarget date fundsriskbased funds stadion managed accounts goal deliver satisfying returns with less volatility underlying holdings etfs cashcash equivalents capabilities qdia designed to fulfill the qualified default investment alternative requirements under the pension protection act and provide a qdia warranty  fiduciary stadion acts as a  investment manager with discretionary control over participant accounts stadion has more than  retirement accounts and is the fifthlargest provider of k managed accounts investment approach stadion’s money managers actively manage the k accounts for more than  individuals making disciplined investment decisions based on what’s happening in the market our proprietary approach is designed to deliver satisfying returns while aiming to minimize losses—with the goal of helping employees prepare financially for retirement the stadion managed account portfolios consist of three key components core equity “flex” and core fixed income they always maintain some level of market exposure while a portion—flex—adjusts in response to market risk levels seeking to protect investors’ assets as they approach retirement we move accounts into increasingly conservative portfolios over time all markets rise and fall which is why managing risk is the key to stadion’s defensive money management  the illustration below compares a traditional balanced portfolio using a static asset allocation strategy with the stadion balanced portfolio which utilizes a dynamic asset allocation strategy the allocated percentages are approximate may change based on market conditions and may vary based on retirement plan provider lowrisk environment and highrisk environment refer to risk levels in equity
