please see definition and reconciliation below   excludes production royalty to related party depreciation depletion and amortization asset retirement obligation expenses and general and administrative costs revenue from coal sales of  million for the three months ended march   was  lower than the comparable period of the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable price variance  the price variance of  million for the three months ended march   was driven primarily by the renewal of sales contracts at less favorable prices as well as unfavorable transportation adjustments included as a component of the price in certain of our longterm coal supply agreements as a result of declining diesel prices this was partially offset by a favorable volume variance experienced for the three months ended march   of  million as compared to the same period of  due to the timing of shipments costs of coal sales of  million for the three months ended march   was  lower than the comparable period of the prior year due primarily to improved operating efficiency on a per ton basis cost of coal sales for the three months ended march   totaled  which represents a decrease of  per ton as compared to the same period of  the decrease in the cost of coal sales per ton for the three months ended march   as compared to the same period of  is due to the closure of our parkway underground mine in the fourth quarter of  which was a high cost operation and improved operating efficiency at our kronos underground mine from increased production due to higher demand for higher quality coal partially offset by higher overall costs at our surface operations from mining in higher ratio reserves general and administrative expenses were  million for the three months ended march   which was  million lower than the comparable period in  the decrease is due primarily to lower labor and benefits expense information technology related costs and insurance costs net loss for the three months ended march   totaled  million as compared to net loss of  million for the three month periods ended march   the increase in net loss of  million is due to an increase in interest expense and additional costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives of  million in  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses during the three months ended march   as compared to the same period of  adjusted ebitda of  million for the three month periods ended march   is  lower than the comparable period of the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from the inclusion in adjusted ebitda of the cash portion of production royalties paid to thoroughbred resources lp thoroughbred of  million which began january   pursuant to existing lease terms and a settlement agreement we reached with thoroughbred that became effective march   the settlement agreement partially offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses in the current quarter as compared to the same period of  liquidity the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash on hand and prior to its termination on november   availability under our revolving credit facility as of march   our total available liquidity was  million which was comprised solely of cash on hand we have experienced recurring losses from operations which has led to a substantial decline in cash flows from operating activities over the last  months our current operating plan indicates that we will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities in addition we entered into the settlement agreement with thoroughbred whereby we agreed among other things to begin paying thoroughbred all production royalties earned on or after january   in cash as permitted under the existing lease terms see   settlement agreement with thoroughbred for more information with respect to the settlement agreement our continuing operating losses negative cash flow projections and other liquidity risks raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern due to our current financial outlook we continue to take steps to preserve our liquidity and manage operating costs including controlling capital expenditures beginning in  we undertook steps to enhance our financial flexibility and reduce cash outflows in the near term including a streamlining of our cost structure and anticipated reductions in production volumes and capital expenditures in addition we are actively negotiating a restructuring with advisers to certain holders of our  senior secured notes due  the notes who collectively beneficially own or manage in excess of  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes we have engaged financial and legal advisers to assist us in restructuring our capital structure and evaluate other potential alternatives to address the impending liquidity constraints however there can be no assurance that any restructuring will be possible on acceptable terms if at all it may be difficult to come to an agreement that is acceptable to all of our creditors our failure to reach an agreement on the terms of a restructuring with our creditors would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations in addition if a successful restructuring with the holders of the notes is not achieved it may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code in order to implement a restructuring or our creditors could force us into an involuntary bankruptcy or liquidation please read our current report on form q filed today and our annual report on form k filed on march   with the securities and exchange commission for additional information about our current financial position including the risks and uncertainties associated with restructuring the notes settlement agreement with thoroughbred starting in december  we received the first of multiple communications from thoroughbred holdings gp llc thoroughbred holdings the general partner of thoroughbred alleging claims associated with various transactions between the parties thoroughbred holdings claimed the thirdparty valuations prepared annually in order to determine the percentage interest in certain jointlyowned land and mineral reserves the jointlyowned property to be transferred from us to thoroughbred pursuant to the first amended and restated royalty deferment and option agreement the royalty agreement were inaccurate in  and prior which resulted in the underpayment of production royalties to thoroughbred in addition thoroughbred holdings took exception to our calculation of the amount of deferred royalties for the year ended december   the amount of certain offsets from these deferred royalties by amounts due from thoroughbred to us pursuant to an administrative services agreement and the offset of certain production royalties that we overpaid to thoroughbred on properties other than the jointlyowned property as of december   amounts owed to thoroughbred totaled  million primarily representing deferred royalties incurred during calendar year   consistent with the previous annual land and reserve transfers pursuant to the royalty agreement armstrong proposed to transfer a  undivided interest in the jointly owned property in satisfaction of the amounts owed which had been ascertained based on a fair market value determination obtained by us from an independent thirdparty  as noted above thoroughbred objected to this amount asserting that based on its own valuation  was substantially undervalued following a series of negotiations to resolve the dispute armstrong and thoroughbred entered into a settlement agreement effective march   in which we agreed to transfer and thoroughbred agreed to accept an additional  undivided interest in jointlyowned property for a total of  bringing thoroughbreds interest in the jointlyowned property to  as of january   the additional  undivided interest was expected to be earned by thoroughbred during the first half of  regardless of the settlement furthermore as part of the settlement agreement armstrong and thoroughbred agreed to mutual waivers and releases related to the royalty agreement the payment of production royalties or any other sums due under the leases prior to january   and the administrative services agreement thoroughbred also waived and released any prior claims against us for lost or wasted coal or mining practices and operational decisions made by us any other demands claims or assertions set forth in the various communications from thoroughbred holdings and its legal counsel to us and any other claims arising from our administration of the leases prior to january   in addition we agreed to begin paying thoroughbred all production royalties earned on or after january   in cash pursuant to the existing lease terms with royalties earned for january and february  totaling  million being paid on march   by letter dated april   certain of the holders of the notes expressed certain objections to entry into the settlement agreement please
