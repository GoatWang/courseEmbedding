funds database in our free hedge funds database we have listed more than  hedge funds and institutional investors you can see the fund’s summary employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore

euclidean technologies ®   «q subscribe to investor letters subscribe to euclideans investor letters first name last name email q» misunderstanding buffett at euclidean we aspire to become widely recognized as the most thoughtful and highperforming practitioners of historybased systematic value investing  given our mission we feel it is important that we comment on new research and developments that relate to our area of focuslast year researchers at a prominent money management firm named aqr published a paper that considered how one might construct a quantitative model emulating the way warren buffett has selected his investments and generated attractive longterm returns  as we believe their conclusions do not represent how warren buffett actually invests we decided to review his investment approach in light of aqr’s paper and consider how we might have approached building a buffett model in a different wayin this letter we share these thoughts in addition to providing details on the fund’s performance and portfolio ytd performancefor the yeartodate through june euclidean fund i lp has returned  in the context of the sp  delivering a total return of   since its inception in august  our partnership has returned  net of fees comprised almost entirely of longterm capital gains while the sp ’s total return has been   these gains translate into annualized compounded net returns of  and  respectively   our ytd returns reflect that certain of our holdings have delivered poor operating results and set low expectations during the first half of the year  our process has us investing in companies that have delivered good operating results in the past but are now surrounded by pessimism and therefore offered at low prices  when the market offers lower prices for current holdings that remain highly ranked by our process we generally invest more in them  when other holdings’ fundamentals evolve such that our process no longer finds them to be attractive investments we sell those holdings according to our portfolio management rules we believe that our portfolio is attractively priced in relation to our companies’ longterm fundamentals and that this bodes well for delivering the longterm performance you count on from euclideanaqr’s quantitative approach to warren buffettstyle investingin late  researchers at aqr a prominent money management firm based in connecticut sought to demonstrate that they could replicate warren buffett’s historical returns at berkshire hathaway by using a quantitative model  the aqr team built this model using factors they feel closely align with mr buffett’s investment style  they attempted to show that their buffett model for weighting stocks across the equity universe when deployed with x leverage can explain much of berkshire hathaway’s historical performance  we encourage you to review the paper contextaqr’s buffett model builds on a long lineage of research initiated by eugene fama and kenneth french  the starting point of their work was the capital asset pricing model capm and the hypothesis that as markets are efficient greater returns can only be achieved by taking on greater risk  risk in the capm — and to efficient market adherents — is defined as beta or the volatility of investment returns when compared to the marketfama and others noted outperformance in certain investment strategies that could not be explained solely through the use of beta and so they searched for other factors that helped explain their observations  one of their findings was called the value factor which showed that by weighing companies with high ratios of book value shareholders’ equity to market value market capitalization one could explain a large portion of the excess returns not captured solely through the use of beta as measured against the market  another finding was that smaller companies tended to deliver higher returns than larger companies and that these excess returns could not be explained using beta alone by augmenting the capm with the value and size factors to create a new threefactor model fama and others felt they could better explain historical market returns  in their minds there should be very few sustainable sources of outperformance against a benchmark constructed using these three factors one substantial challenge to their views however was that warren buffett’s returns and the returns delivered by certain other value investors from the grahamdodd school of investing were persistently stronger than could be explained by the threefactor model  as a result researchers at aqr attempted to augment this model to see if they could explain berkshire hathaway’s historical performance  aqr’s buffett model – core assumptionsfor the purpose of this letter we would like to summarize four core attributes of the aqr model and contrast them with how we perceive buffett actually invests thus highlighting ways we think aqr’s model could be improved  the first attribute consists of fama’s original value factor  the other three represent in part how these researchers augmented fama’s threefactor model in an attempt to emulate buffett’s returns  our understanding of these four characteristics of the aqr model can be summarized as value defined as the ratio of a company’s book value to its market valuequality defined as the composite of a variety of features including profitability measured in multiple ways and the proportion of earnings paid out to shareholders all viewed in the context of a company’s growth volatility of returns and balance sheet leverage  companies with high marks on this composite are considered quality companies and are given positive weights in aqr’s simulated portfolios  companies with low marks are considered junk companies and are given negative weights  this factor is termed quality minus junkbettingagainstbeta building on research that suggests lowvolatility stocks have produced higher riskadjusted returns than highvolatility stocks the aqr researchers adopted a factor termed bettingagainstbeta  in this context companies with high betas high volatility in their share prices are given negative weights  companies with low betas are given positive weights leverage berkshire operates with leverage in the form of deferred taxes and lowcost insurance float  what aqr found is that if a model constructed on the above three factors is leveraged by x it would show similar historical returns to those realized by berkshire hathaway from  to the present they found berkshire’s actual historical leverage to be generally consistent with xusing these attributes and several others the aqr model constructs what would effectively be a longshort portfolio representing hundreds of positions  some companies across these factors would have net positive weights and thus the aqr model would have a longposition in those companies  other companies would have net negative weights across these factors and aqr would be effectively short those companies   with this model as these holdings would be periodically rebalanced to reflect companies’ shifting fundamentals and prices aqr can estimate the returns this model would have achieved in the past  when these returns are amplified by x leverage the aqr model shows estimated returns that resemble berkshire’s superior record our sense of how buffett actually investswe do not believe buffett invests in the manner described by aqr  moreover we believe one could do very well with a model that reflects qualities buffett actually uses and articulates in his letters to berkshire hathaway’s shareholders  doing so might also address a potentially dangerous conclusion from the aqr paper that one should leverup a buffettlike portfolio by x to do well over time our hypothesis is this except when managing very large amounts of capital as berkshire now must do one could demonstrate simulated returns approaching aqr’s results without the extreme leverage requirement  after sharing our thoughts on how buffett’s actual investment style differs from the selected aqr assumptions we introduce how one could test this hypothesis   valueaqr’s value factor the ratio of a company’s book value to market value is a remarkably crude measure for assessing whether a company’s shares are being offered for more or less than they are worth perhaps this is why buffett talks about book value as a measure of limited worth when estimating the intrinsic value of a business   after all book value reveals very little about the operations of a company it makes no distinction between a pile of cash and a company with productive assets great products and loyal customers instead when evaluating intrinsic value buffett focuses on understanding the amount of cash that a business can generate and distribute to its owners  he calls this concept ownerearnings and in berkshire’s  letter to shareholders he writes these represent a reported earnings plus b depreciation depletion amortization and certain other noncash chargesless c the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment etc that the business requires to fully maintain its longterm competitive position and its unit volume our ownerearnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by gaap since c must be a guess  and one sometimes very difficult to make despite this problem we consider the owner earnings figure not the gaap figure to be the relevant item for valuation purposes letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett because estimations of a company’s future owner earnings are always approximate and imprecise buffett repeatedly discusses the importance of looking for opportunities with wide margins of safety  in his  letter buffett writeswe insist on a margin of safety in our purchase price  if we calculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher than its price were not interested in buying  we believe this marginofsafety principle so strongly emphasized by ben graham to be the cornerstone of investment success letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett in our own research and simulations we found that buying companies at very lowprices in relation to their demonstrated earning power would have yielded better results than using booktomarket and other commonly referenced ratios for ranking companies as potential investments  perhaps aqr’s buffett model could become more robust by swapping the traditional fama value factor for one that embraces the ownerearnings measure and marginofsafety principle that buffett describes as being at the core of his investment approachqualitywhen assessing the quality of a business aqr employs quite a few metrics that collectively assess a company’s profitability growth safety and payout ratio  certainly buffett cares deeply about the quality of the businesses he owns  for any given company we expect he would want to understand much of what aqr includes in its quality assessmentwe believe however that one does not need to take a “kitchen sink” approach to defining business quality and that doing so may actually dilute what is most important  in fact buffett seems to approach the question of business quality in a much simpler way  leaving the question of price aside the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return the worst business to own is one that must or will do the opposite – that is consistently employ evergreater amounts of capital at very low rates of return letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett in the context of thinking like a whole owner we believe that buffett cares deeply about the magnitude and resiliency of a company’s longterm return on capital  return on capital is simply the relationship between the earnings a company generates and the amount of capital tied up in its business  for example a company that can consistently deliver  for every  in capital employed would show a robust  return on capital  to buffett this would be a higher quality business than another that delivered a lesser yield or showed deteriorating or inconsistent returns on capital  moreover this yield relationship between earnings and invested capital allows buffett to view a prospective investment in relation to all other potential uses for capital be it the purchase of real estate a bond shares in a public company or — in his role as berkshire’s ceo — the various operating divisions of berkshire hathaway in this context of return on capital concepts in aqr’s model — such as a company’s payout ratio or its rate of growth — can be good or bad  from a longterm investor’s perspective neither of these alternatives to reinvest or pay out earnings proves to be inherently better than the other instead our research supports what common sense might suggest  a company is most effective when it deploys capital at the highest rate of return  that returns on capital trump growth and payout ratio in buffett’s analysis seems to be supported by the following quotesyou should wish your earnings to be reinvested if they can be expected to earn high returns and you should wish them paid to you if low returns are the likely outcome of reinvestment letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett andgrowth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing  in other words only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of longterm market value in the case of a low return business requiring incremental funds growth hurts the investor letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett in a linear model such as what aqr employs growth and payout ratio are considered increasingly good as they increase in value  however as buffett describes things are not so simple or linear in reality  perhaps exploring the nonlinear relationships between measures of growth payout ratio and profitability could yield powerful insights that would allow one to more closely emulate the tradeoffs buffett describes  at the very least adopting a quality measure that focuses more directly on the persistency and magnitude of a company’s return on capital could reduce the complexity of the aqr model while also increasing alignment with buffett’s investment style  beta as riskwe wonder if anyone who thinks buffett employs a bettingagainstbeta strategy or that he even considers the beta of a stock when investing has ever heard a word hes said  buffett thinks like a business owner and whether he owns  of a company or just a few shares his mindset is that he has a claim on the longterm economics of that business  thus for buffett beta — the relative volatility of a company’s share price — matters only in the sense that it reflects the stock market’s tendency to periodically provide opportunities to purchase good companies at attractive prices this view is well articulated in the section titled common stock investments in his  letter to berkshire’s shareholders  we excerpt a small section here but encourage you to read the section in its entirety academics however like to define investment risk differently averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock or portfolio of stocks  that is their volatility as compared to that of a large universe of stocks… for owners of a business  and thats the way we think of shareholders  the academics definition of risk is far off the mark so much so that it produces absurdities  for example under betabased theory a stock that has dropped very sharply compared to the market  as had the washington post when we bought it in   becomes riskier at the lower price than it was at the higher price  would that description have then made any sense to someone who was offered the entire company at a vastlyreduced pricein fact the true investor welcomes volatility… a wildly fluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will periodically be attached to solid businesses  it is impossible to see how the availability of such prices can be thought of as increasing the hazards for an investor who is totally free to either ignore the market or exploit its folly letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett with these words and his allusions to benjamin graham’s mr market  over the decades our sense is that any true effort to model buffett’s investment activity must exclude beta when evaluating potential investments  price volatility has meaning to buffett only when the market provides the opportunity to either buy a quality company at such a discount that there is an acceptable a margin of safety or sell a company at a fulsome price  those opportunities are already captured in the interplay between the concepts of value and quality previously discussed longshort portfolio construction and x leverageacross the various factors of the aqr model some companies have net positive weights and thus the aqr model would have a longposition in those companies  other companies have net negative weights across these factors and aqr would be effectively short those companies  the aqr paper explains that the longonly backtest of their model shows worse performance than their longshort construction  the implication is that in order to adhere to the aqr model and aspire to the results they present you would need to manage a portfolio that has hundreds of positions both long and short but what could be further from how buffett invests  we see no evidence in his letters that buffett has established short positions instead we find that he has done well with a fairly concentrated longonly portfolio of wholly and partially owned companies  in this context aqr’s approach has engineered a replication of buffett’s performance that seems to materially deviate from the causeandeffect relationship underlying buffett’s longterm success which could be summarized as cause selective and sustained investing in good companies when offered at low prices yields effect good longterm investment resultsadding to this concern is the big difference between the relatively lowrisk leverage berkshire enjoys with insurance float or deferred income taxes and the highrisk leverage that comes when investing on margin  if in fact one must invest in public stocks with x leverage to achieve buffettstyle returns then attempting to execute on aqr’s findings seems like a risky proposition in any respect  buffett sums this point up well in his  letterunquestionably some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money however thats also been a way to get very poor when leverage works it magnifies your gains your spouse thinks youre clever and your neighbors get envious but leverage is addictive once having profited from its wonders very few people retreat to more conservative practices and as we all learned in third grade  and some relearned in   any series of positive numbers however impressive the numbers may be evaporates when multiplied by a single zero history tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes even when it is employed by very smart people letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett we believe that if aqr more closely modeled how buffett actually invests they would not need to use x leverage to demonstrate the returns they seek at least not until their fund had an amount of capital similar to berkshires currently in excess of b to manage and compound  it is important to remember that buffett did quite well as an investor without leverage during the s s and early s — the days of the berkshire partnership and before berkshire hathaway had a substantial insurance operation providing the relatively lowrisk leverage berkshire has more recently employedanother way to build a buffett modelwhen seeking insight from historical data it is important to keep in mind the difference between correlation and causation  quantitative analysis yields sustainable insight only when it identifies explainable causeandeffect relationships that are likely to persist into the future  warren buffett has provided an incredible body of work in his letters to investors regarding how he invests the concepts at the core of his approach include ownerearnings marginofsafety mr market return on capital and lowrisk approaches to leverage  these concepts have enabled him to find good companies offered at good prices the cause and deliver strong longterm investment returns the effect if you believe that the future will resemble the past such that one could do well by pursuing the same causeandeffect relationships underlying buffett’s longterm success then crafting your investment style after his makes sense we feel however that the aqr approach deviates very far from buffett’s investment principles  perhaps aqr found some other source of sustainable outperformance but have they found the causeandeffect relationships behind why buffett has done well over time  we do not believe so  we believe that one can borrow from buffett’s methodology to create successful approaches to systematic investing  we would propose an alternative characterized by the following differences from the aqr modelwe would begin with the principles of intrinsic value marginofsafety and return on capital that most closely align with buffett’s welldocumented investment philosophywe would use more sophisticated tools than the linear regression techniques employed by aqr today tools like machine learning allow for exploration of a much larger universe of both linear and nonlinear models we believe that these tools allow for the possibility of finding models that better emulate the subtleties of buffettstyle investing for example as shown earlier buffett writes in his letters that growth and payout ratio are not necessarily good or bad with the answer depending on the context of the company’s returns on capital  nonlinear models provide the flexibility to find subtle but potentially crucial tradeoffs between a company’s various operating qualities that buffett may have found helpful when investing    we would make a greater effort to verify the causeandeffect relationships underlying our results  to this end we would perform outofsample testing to validate that the factors and models that appear successful during one period of history are not the result of chance correlations much like in school the goal should not be memorizing answers to specific questions rather it should be the comprehension of important principles that allow one to solve future problems  by learning the best way to express buffett’s investment principles on a subset of companies from the past and then testing those insights on new companies we would evaluate whether we found random correlations in the data that are unlikely to persist or whether we were on track to uncover the seemingly timeless causeandeffect relationships underlying warren buffett’s longterm successwe greatly value the privilege of managing a portion of your

connecting with you   all returns are purely historical and are no indication of future performance “buffett’s alpha” by andrea frazzini david kabiller and lasse heje pedersen november  “intrinsic value can be defined simply it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life we regularly report our pershare book value an easily calculable number though one of limited use the limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities which are carried on our books at their current prices rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values” berkshire hathaway owner’s manual warren buffett june  see letter to berkshire shareholders warren buffett  we share these numbers because they are easytocommunicate measures that show the results of our systematic process for buying shares in historically sound companies when their earnings are on sale  it is important to note that euclidean uses similar concepts but different measures to assess individual companies as potential investments  our models look at certain metrics over longer periods and seek to understand their volatility and rate of growth  our process also makes a series of adjustments to company financial statements that our research has found to more accurately assess results makes complex tradeoffs between measures and so on  these numbers should however give you a sense of what you own as a euclidean investor  in general higher numbers for these measures are more attractive  the key measures areearnings yield – this measures how inexpensive a company is in relation to its demonstrated ability to generate cash for its owners a company with twice the earnings yield as another is half as expensive therefore all else being equal we seek companies with very high earnings yields  earnings yield reflects a company’s past fouryear average earnings before interest and tax divided by its current enterprise value enterprise value  market value  debt – cashreturn on capital – this measures how well a company has historically generated cash for its owners in relation to how much capital has been invested equity and longterm debt in the business  at its highest level this measure reflects two important things  first it is an indicator of whether a company’s business is efficient at deploying capital in a way that generates additional income for its shareholders  second it indicates whether management has good discipline in deciding what to do with the cash it generates  for example all else being equal companies that overpay for acquisitions or retain more capital than they can productively deploy will show lower returns on capital than businesses that do the opposite  return on capital reflects a company’s fouryear average earnings before interest and tax divided by its current equity  longterm debt equity  assets – this measures how much of a company’s assets can be claimed by its common shareholders versus being claimed by others  high numbers here imply that the company owns a large portion of its figurative “house” and all else being equal indicates a better readiness to weather tough timesrevenue growth rate – this is the annualized rate a company has grown over the past four years    all euclidean measures are formed by summing the values of euclidean’s prorata share of each portfolio company’s financials that is if euclidean owns  of a company’s shares it first calculates  of that company’s market value revenue debt assets earnings and so on then it sums those numbers with its prorata share of all other portfolio companies this provides the total revenue assets earnings etc across the portfolio that are used to calculate the portfolio’s aggregate measures presented here  the sp  measures are calculated in a similar way as described above the market values revenue debt assets earnings etc for each company in the sp  are added together those aggregate numbers are then used to calculate the metrics above for example the earnings yield of the sp  is calculated as the total average fouryear earnings before interest and taxes across all  companies divided by those companies’ collective enterprise values all  companies’ market values  cash – debt euclidean’s largest
