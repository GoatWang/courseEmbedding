the world’s most eminent physicist stephen hawking argues that the laws of physics not the will of god provide the real explanation as to how life on earth came into being yet physical laws on their own cannot create anything they are merely a description of what normally happens under certain given conditions although hawking’s argument is being hailed as controversial and groundbreaking it is hardly new this article is based on one that appeared in the daily mail september   it is an initial response to stephen hawking and leonard mlodinow’s book the grand design this article may not be placed on the internet or reproduced without permission  john lennox september  in his latest book the world’s most eminent physicist stephen hawking challenges belief in the divine creation of the universe according to him the laws of physics not the will of god provide the real explanation as to how life on earth came into being the big bang he argues was the inevitable consequence of these laws “because there is a law such as gravity the universe can and will create itself from nothing” hawking’s book coauthored with caltech physicist leonard mlodinow is entitled the grand design which for many people will suggest the existence of a grand designer—but that is actually something that the book is designed to deny hawking claims “spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing why the universe exists why we exist it is not necessary to invoke god to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going” although hawking’s argument is being hailed as controversial and groundbreaking it is hardly new for years other scientists have made similar claims maintaining that the awesome sophisticated complexity of the world around us can be interpreted solely by reference to the basic stuff of the universe massenergy or to its physical laws such as gravity in the excerpts i have seen from the book at this writing it is not yet in the shops there are what appear to be a number of misunderstandings and logical errors firstly hawking’s view of god is inadequate from what i cited above it would seem that he thinks of god as a “god of the gaps” put forward as an explanation if we don’t yet have a scientific one—hence his conclusion that physics has no room for god as it has removed the last place where he might be found— for the moment of creation but this is certainly not what any of the great monotheistic religions believe for them god is not only to be found at creation he is the author of the whole show god both created the universe and constantly sustains it in existence without him there would be nothing there for physicists to study in particular therefore god is the creator both of the bits of the universe we don’t understand and the bits we do and it is of course the bits we do understand that give the most evidence of god’s existence and activity indeed just as i can admire the genius behind a work of engineering or art the more i understand it so my worship of the creator increases the more i understand what he has done hawking’s inadequate view of god could well be linked with his attitude to philosophy in general he writes “philosophy is dead it has not kept up with modern developments in science particularly in physics as a result scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge” what an astonishing statement apart from the scientistic hubris of this statement it constitutes wonderful evidence that at least one scientist hawking himself has not only not kept up with philosophy he does not appear to understand the first thing about it nor its commitment to the elementary rules of logical analysis for hawking’s statement is itself a philosophical statement it is manifestly not a statement of science it is a philosophical statement about science therefore because it says that philosophy is dead it contradicts itself it is a classic example of logical incoherence not only that hawking insofar as he is interpreting and applying science to ultimate questions like the existence of god is doing metaphysics saying philosophy is dead is very dangerous especially when you yourself engage in it take for instance hawking’s statement quoted above “because there is a law of gravity the universe can and will create itself from nothing” clearly he assumes that gravity or perhaps only the law of gravity exists that is not nothing so the universe is not created from nothing worse still the statement “the universe can and will create itself from nothing” is selfcontradictory if i say “x creates y” this presupposes the existence of x in the first place in order to bring y into existence if i say “x creates x” i presuppose the existence of x in order to account for the existence of x to presuppose the existence of the universe to account for its existence is logically incoherent one might add for good measure the fact that when physicists talk about “nothing” they often mean a quantum vacuum which is manifestly not nothing could this be “much ado about nothing” hawking here is using the same incoherent “argument” as oxford chemist peter atkins also a well known atheist who believes that “spacetime generates its own dust in the process of its own selfassembly” atkins dubs this the “cosmic bootstrap” principle referring to the self contradictory idea of a person lifting himself by pulling on his own bootlace his oxford colleague philosopher of religion keith ward is surely right to say that atkins’s view of the universe is as blatantly selfcontradictory as the name he gives to it pointing out that it is “logically impossible for a cause to bring about some effect without already being in existence” ward concludes “between the hypothesis of god and the hypothesis of a cosmic bootstrap there is no competition we were always right to think that persons or universes who seek to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps are forever doomed to failure” what this shows is that nonsense remains nonsense even when talked by worldfamous scientists false alternatives because hawking has both an inadequate concept of god and of philosophy he blunders into a further series of errors by asking us to choose between god and the laws of physics here he confuses two very different things physical law and personal agency the choice he asks us to make is between false alternatives this is a classic category error his call for us to choose between physics and god is as manifestly absurd as demanding that we choose either the laws of physics or aeronautical engineer sir frank whittle in order to explain the jet engine both explanations are necessary they do not conflict but complement one another that category mistake was not made by a previous holder of hawking’s chair at cambridge sir isaac newton when newton discovered his law of gravitation he did not say “now i have gravity i don’t need god” what he did was to write principia mathematica the most famous book in the history of science expressing the hope that it would “persuade the thinking man” to believe in god the laws of physics can explain how the jet engine works but not how it came to exist in the first place it is selfevident that a jet engine could have not have been created by the laws of physics on their own—that task needed the intelligence and creative engineering work of whittle indeed come to think of it the laws of physics plus frank whittle could not on their own produce a jet engine there needs additionally to be some material around the place that is subject to those laws and that can be worked on by whittle for not only did scientists not put the universe there neither did science or the laws of mathematical physics yet hawking seems to think they did in a brief history of time he hinted at this kind of explanation in suggesting that a theory might bring the universe into existence the usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe why does the universe go to all the bother of existing is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence or does it need a creator and if so does he have any other effect on the universe the idea of a theory or physical laws bringing the universe into existence strikes me as a serious misunderstanding of the nature of such laws—or am i missing something scientists expect to develop theories involving mathematical laws that describe natural phenomena and have done so with spectacular success however the laws that we find cannot themselves even cause anything let alone create it it seems to me delightfully ironic that if i dare mention it no other than william paley said as much long ago speaking of the person who had just stumbled on a watch on the heath and picked it up he says that such a person would not be less surprised to be informed that the watch in his hand was nothing more than the result of the laws of metallic nature it is a perversion of language to assign any law as the efficient operative cause of any thing a law presupposes an agent for it is only the mode according to which an agent proceeds it implies a power for it is the order according to which that power acts without this agent without this power which are both distinct from itself the law does nothing is nothing physical laws on their own cannot create anything they are merely a mathematical description of what normally happens under certain given conditions newton’s law of gravitation does not create gravity it does not even explain gravity as newton himself realized in fact the laws of physics are not only incapable of creating anything they cannot even cause anything to happen for instance newton’s celebrated laws of motion never caused a snooker ball to race across the green baize table that can only be done by people using a snooker cue and the actions of their own muscles the laws enable us to analyze the motion and enable us to map the trajectory of the ball’s movement in the future provided nothing external interferes  but they are powerless to move the ball let alone bring it into existence yet wellknown physicist paul davies appears to agree with hawking there’s no need to invoke anything supernatural in the origins of the universe or of life i have never liked the idea of divine tinkering for me it is much more inspiring to believe that a set of mathematical laws can be so clever as to bring all these things into being  however in the world in which most of us live the simple law of arithmetic    never brought anything into being by itself it certainly has never put any money into my bank account if i first put £ into the bank and then later another £ the laws of arithmetic will rationally explain how it is that i now have £ in the bank but if i never put any money into the bank myself and simply leave it to the laws of arithmetic to bring money into being in my bank account i shall remain permanently bankrupt c s lewis saw this long ago of the laws of nature he says they produce no events they state the pattern to which every event—it only it can be induced to happen—must conform just as the rules of arithmetic state the pattern to which all transactions with money must conform—if only you can get hold of any money thus in one sense the laws of nature cover the whole field of space and time in another what they leave out is precisely the whole real universe—the incessant torrent of actual events which makes up true history that must come from somewhere else to think the laws can produce it is like thinking that you can create real money by simply doing sums for every law in the last resort says “if you have a then you will get b” but first catch your a the laws won’t do it for you laws give us only a universe of ifs and ands not this universe which actually exists what we know through laws and general principles is a series of connections but in order for there to be a real universe the connections must be given something to connect a torrent of opaque actualities must be fed into the pattern if god created the world then he is precisely the source of this torrent and it alone gives our truest principles anything to be true about but if god is the ultimate source of all concrete individual things and events then god himself must be concrete and individual in the highest degree unless the origin of all other things were itself concrete and individual nothing else could be so for there is no conceivable means whereby what is abstract or general could itself produce concrete reality bookkeeping continued to all eternity could never produce one farthing science fiction the world of strict naturalism in which clever mathematical laws all by themselves bring the universe and life into existence is pure science fiction theories and laws do not bring matterenergy into existence the view that they nevertheless somehow have that capacity seems a rather desperate refuge and it is hard to see what else it could be but a refuge from the alternative possibility implied by hawking’s question cited above “or does it need a creator” if hawking were not so dismissive of philosophy he might have come across wittgenstein statement that the “deception of modernism” is the idea that the laws of nature explain the world to us when all they do is to describe structural regularities richard feynman a nobel laureate in physics takes the matter further …the fact that there are rules at all to be checked is a kind of miracle that it is possible to find a rule like the inverse square law of gravitation is some sort of miracle it is not understood at all but it leads to the possibility of prediction—that means it tells you what you would expect to happen in an experiment you have not yet done the very fact that those laws can be mathematically formulated was for einstein a constant source of amazement that pointed beyond the physical universe to that “spirit vastly superior to that of man” hawking has signally failed to answer the central question why is there something rather than nothing he says that the existence of gravity means the creation of the universe was inevitable but how did gravity come to exist in the first place what was the creative force behind its birth who put it there with all its properties and potential for mathematical description similarly when hawking argues in support of his theory of spontaneous creation that it was only necessary for “the blue touch paper” to be lit to “set the universe going” i am tempted to ask where did this blue touch paper come from it is clearly not part of the universe if it set the universe going so who lit it if not god allan sandage widely regarded as the father of modern astronomy discoverer of quasars and winner of the crafoord prize astronomy’s equivalent of the nobel prize is in no doubt about his answer i find it quite improbable that such order came out of chaos there has to be some organizing principle god to me is a mystery but is the explanation for the miracle of existence—why there is something rather than nothing  trying to avoid the clear evidence for the existence of a divine intelligence behind nature atheist scientists are forced to ascribe creative powers to less and less credible candidates like mass energy and the laws of nature in fact hawking not only has not got rid of god he has not even got rid of the god of the gaps in which no sensible person believes for the very theories he advances to banish the god of the gaps are themselves highly speculative and untestable hawking like every other physicist is confronted with powerful evidence of design as he explains in his book our universe and its laws appear to have a design that both is tailormade to support us and if we are to exist leaves little room for alteration that is not easily explained and raises the natural question of why it is that way… the discovery relatively recently of the extreme finetuning of so many of the laws of nature could lead at least some of us back to the old idea that this grand design is the work of some grand designer… that is not the answer of modern science…our universe seems to be one of many each with different laws the multiverse theory thus we arrive at the multiverse the idea here roughly speaking as there are several theories is that there are so many universes some suggest infinitely many whatever that means that anything that can happen will happen in some universe it is then not surprising so the argument goes that there is at least one universe like ours we note in passing that hawking has once again fallen into the trap of offering false alternatives god or the multiverse from a theoretical point of view as philosophersthat despised race have pointed out god could create as many universes as he pleases the multiverse concept of itself does not rule god out in addition to that forgetting other universes the physical constants in this universe are finetuned they could have been otherwise so that the theory of the multiverse does not in any case annul that evidence of god’s “grand design” that is to be perceived in the universe but back to hawking’s multiverse here once more he moves out beyond science into the very realm of philosophy whose death he announces in the very same book furthermore hawking claims to be the voice of modern science this gives a false impression where the multiverse is concerned since there are weighty voices within science that do not support hawking’s view for instance john polkinghorne himself an eminent theoretical physicist rejects the multiverse concept let us recognize these speculations for what they are they are not physics but in the strictest sense metaphysics there is no purely scientific reason to believe in an ensemble of universes by construction these other worlds are unknowable by us a possible explanation of equal intellectual respectability—and to my mind greater economy and elegance—would be that this one world is the way it is because it is the creation of the will of a creator who purposes that it should be so i am tempted to add that belief in god seems an infinitely more rational option if the alternative is to believe that every other universe that can possibly exist does exist including one in which richard dawkins is the archbishop of canterbury christopher hitchens the pope and billy graham has just been voted atheist of the year hawking’s ultimate theory to be serious once more but perhaps i was serious hawking’s ultimate theory to explain why the laws of physics are as they are is called mtheory a theory of supersymmetric gravity that involves very sophisticated concepts such as vibrating strings in eleven dimensions hawking confidently calls it the “unified theory that einstein was expecting to find” if it is it will be a triumph of mathematical physics but for the reasons given above far from administering the deathblow to god it will give us more even more insight into his creatorial wisdom don page a theoretical physicist from the university of alberta who is a former student of hawking and has coauthored eight papers with him says “i certainly would agree that even if mtheory were a fully formulated theory which it isn’t yet and were correct which of course we don’t know that would not imply that god did not create the universe although it does not therefore affect my argument at all it is worth recording that not all physicists are as convinced as hawking about the validity of his theory and have been quick off the mark to say so for instance theoretical physicist jim alkhalili says the connection between this multiverse idea and mtheory is however tentative advocates of mtheory such as witten and hawking would have us believe that it is done and dusted but its critics have been sharpening their knives for a few years now arguing that mtheory is not even a proper scientific theory if it is untestable experimentally at the moment it is just a compelling and beautiful mathematical construct and in fact only one of a number of candidate toe’s theories of everything hawking is rightly critical of those with religious faith who regard the finetuning of the universe to suit us as evidence of a supreme designer but to use the same argument as evidence of the correctness of mtheory is in my view not that much more convincing paul davies whom we cited above says of mtheory “it is not testable not even in any foreseeable future” oxford physicist frank close goes further “mtheory is not even defined… we are even told ‘no one seems to know what the m stands for’ perhaps it is ‘myth’” close concludes “i don’t see that mtheory adds one iota to the god debate either pro or con”  jon butterworth who works at the large hadron collider in switzerland states that “mtheory is highly speculative and certainly not in the zone of science that we have got any evidence for”  a move to advance the cause of atheism by means of a highly speculative untestable scientific theory which even if it were true could not dislodge god in any case is not likely to be very effective science and religion much of the rationale behind hawking’s argument lies in the idea that there is a deepseated conflict between science and religion but this is not a discord that i recognize for me as a christian believer the beauty of the scientific laws reinforces my faith in an intelligent divine creator the more i understand science the more i believe in god because of my wonder at the breadth sophistication and integrity of his creation indeed the very reason that science flourished so vigorously in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under men like galileo kepler and newton was precisely because of their conviction that the laws of nature that were then being discovered and defined reflected the influence of a divine lawgiver one of the fundamental themes of christianity is that the universe was built according to a rational intelligent design far from belief in god hindering science it was the motor that drove it the fact that science is mainly a rational activity leads us to another flaw in hawking’s thinking he like so many atheists wants us to believe that we human beings are nothing but “mere collections of fundamental particles of nature” he does not seem to realize that if this were true it would not only undermine belief in god it would undermine the very rationality we need to study science indeed if it were true how could we even know it after all if the brain is thus merely the end product of a mindless unguided process then there is no reason to believe in its capacity to tell us the truth hawking’s view makes no sense— in every sense of that word the existence of the capacity for rational thought is surely a pointer not downwards to chance and necessity but upwards to an intelligent source of that capacity we live in an information age and we are well aware that language type information is intimately connected with intelligence for instance we only have to see a few letters of the alphabet spelling our name in the sand to recognize at once the work of an intelligent agent how much more likely then is the existence of an intelligent creator behind human dna the colossal biological database that contains no fewer than  billion “letters”—the longest “word” yet discovered it is fascinating that hawking in attacking religion feels compelled to put so much emphasis on the big bang theory because even if the nonbelievers don’t like it the big bang resonates powerfully with the christian narrative of creation that is why before the big bang gained currency so many scientists were keen to dismiss it since it seemed to support the bible story some clung to aristotle’s view of the “eternal universe” without beginning or end but this theory and later variants of it are now discredited the bible which has been quietly asser ting for millennia that there was a beginning has proved to be correct it is important finally to say that rational support for the existence of god is not only to be found in the realm of science for science is not as some think coextensive with rationality history supplies us with powerful evidence that god revealed himself to mankind through jesus christ two millennia ago this is welldocumented not just in the biblical record there are important extrabiblical sources and a wealth of archaeological findings that confirm the reliability of the biblical narrative my faith in god rests not only on the testimony of science but also on the testimony of history particularly to the fact that jesus christ rose from the dead moreover the religious experience of millions of believers cannot lightly be dismissed i myself and my own family can testify to the uplifting influence that faith in christ as lord has had on our lives something which defies the idea that we are nothing more than a random collection of molecules just as strong is the obvious reality that we are moral beings capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong there is no scientific route to such ethics physics cannot inspire our concern for others or the spirit of altruism that has existed in human societies since the dawn of time the existence of a common pool of moral values points to the existence of a transcendent being beyond mere scientific laws indeed the message of atheism has always been a curiously depressing one portraying us as selfish creatures bent on nothing more than survival and selfgratification atheism is a hopeless faith by contrast the christian message based solidly on the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead gives real hope hawking also thinks that the potential existence of other life forms in the universe undermines the traditional religious conviction that we are living on a unique godcreated planet but there is no proof that other life forms are out there and hawking certainly does not present any it always amuses me that atheists often argue for the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence beyond earth yet they are only too eager to denounce the possibility that there exists a vast intelligent being “out there”—god hawking’s fusillade will not shake the foundations of an intelligent faith that is based on the cumulative evidence of science
