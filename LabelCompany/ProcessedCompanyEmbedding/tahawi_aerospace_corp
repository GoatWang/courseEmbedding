company has one faa type a a type certificate number as  ba with modifications for two variations of prototype airplanes one for four passenger twinengine aircraft and the other for six passenger twinengine aircraft both certificate and prototype aircrafts are included in our ip along with a partially assembled plane in the construction jig a static plane model used to superimpose load factors for stress and structure all dies jigs and molds utilized to fabricate the airplane parts enough formed parts for  aircraft frames and all available raw materials in addition all intellectual property rights and patents associated with the aircraft as well as all available blueprints designs catalog and card files and books used to construct the aircraft are also included in the sale originally these aircraft were part of a sam burnsmississippi state university study to develop lightweight fuelefficient passenger planes that could be converted to jets in the s both aircraft feature twin reciprocating engines utilizing semimonologue an allaluminum basic frame structure with fiberglass nose tail wing tips fairings and cowls a circular fuselage at midwing and a tail in a low drag design that is aerodynamically smooth construction also a cabin airoperated stairway entrance opens into a depressed center walkway the tricycle landing gear is hydraulically operated as well as fully retractable electrically operated flaps are slotted with a long lip and large radius this faa type certificate is immediate production ready and reflects several years worth of extensive engineering and investment by nasa tahawi analyzed the market for the four and six passages and limited cargo aircrafts and determined that existing aircraft are highly priced and not fuel efficient tahawi believes that offering a product that  cheaper and cost effective in this niche markets is highly needed this offering securities offered maximum of  shares of class a common stock at  per share      common stock  shares outstanding before the   offering       common stock  common consisting of  class a shares and  class b shares outstanding after the   offering    use of proceeds   the use of

continuing development of the  and  passenger’s turboprop aircrafts and v development of the manufacturing facility and to initiate production     investing in our shares involves a high degree of risk as an investor you should be able to bear a complete loss of your investment you should carefully consider the information set forth in the “risk factors” section of this offering circular                risk factors investing in our shares involves risk in evaluating tahawi aerospace corp and an investment in the shares careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this offering circular each of these risk factors could materially adversely affect tahawi’s business operating results or financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our shares the following is a summary of the most significant factors that make this offering speculative or substantially risky the company is still subject to all the same risks that all companies in its industry and all companies in the economy are exposed to these include risks relating to economic downturns political and economic events and technological developments additionally earlystage companies are inherently more risky than more developed companies you should consider general risks as well as specific risks when deciding whether to invest we are an early stage company and have not yet generated any revenues tahawi has had no net income and no revenues generated since its inception there is no assurance that tahawi will ever be profitable or generate sufficient revenue to pay dividends to the holders of the shares tahawi does not believe it will be able to generate revenues without successfully fund raising which involves substantial risk as a result tahawi is dependent upon the proceeds of this offering and additional fund raises to start manufacturing its conventional propeller  and  seats aircrafts if planned operating levels are changed higher operating costs encountered lower sales revenue received more time is needed to implement the plan or less funding received from customer deposits or sales more funds than currently anticipated may be required additional difficulties may be encountered during this stage of development such as unanticipated problems relating to development testing and initial and continuing regulatory compliance vendor manufacturing costs production and assembly and the competitive and regulatory environments in which tahawi intends to operate if additional capital is not available when required if at all or is not available on acceptable terms tahawi may be forced to modify or abandon its business plan the company has realized operating losses to date and expects to incur losses in the future the company has operated at a loss since inception and these losses are likely to continue tahawi’s net losses for  were  respectively until the company achieves profitability it will have to seek other sources of capital in order to continue operations the company’s management has issued a going concern opinion tahawi’s management has issued a “going concern” opinion on the company’s financial statements the company has negative working capital has incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt in the opinion of the board about its ability to continue as a going concern we are controlled by our chairman whose interests may differ from those of the other shareholders as of the date of this offering circular adam altahawi owns the majority of shares of the company’s common stock and his majority ownership might continue even after the issuance of the shares therefore mr altahawi is now and could be in the future in a position to elect or change the members of the board of directors and to control tahawi’s business and affairs including certain significant corporate actions including but not limited to acquisitions the sale or purchase of assets and the issuance and sale of tahawi’ shares tahawi also may be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to the other holders of the shares without mr tahawi’s consent mr tahawi’s interests might differ from the interests of other shareholders        the development period for the manufacturing facility even if it meets the development schedule tahawi does not expect to deliver aircraft until the second quarter of  at the earliest as a result the receipt of significant revenues is not anticipated until that time and may occur later than projected tahawi depends on receiving large amounts of capital and other financing to complete its manufacturing facility with no assurance that tahawi will be successful in completing its development work or becoming profitable the company will face significant market competition the  and  seats twin engine prop and turboprop aircrafts competes with a variety of aircraft manufactured in the united states and abroad further tahawi could face competition from competitors of whom tahawi is not aware that have developed or are developing technologies that will offer alternatives to the tahawi’s aircrafts competitors could develop an aircraft that renders the tahawi’s aircrafts less competitive than tahawi believes it will become many existing potential competitors are wellestablished have or may have longerstanding relationships with customers and potential business partners have or may have greater name recognition and have or may have access to significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources delays in aircraft delivery schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect the company’s financial results once tahawi begins its presales program and begins receiving refundable deposits for its aircrafts pursuant to its agreements some or all deposit holders might not transition to nonrefundable purchase contracts until prior to aircraft delivery if at all aircraft customers might respond to weak economic conditions by canceling orders resulting in lower demand for our aircraft and other materials such as parts or services such as training which the company expects to generate revenue such events would have a material adverse effect on tahawi’s financial results developing new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties tahawi is currently has one faa type certificate with modifications for  variations of prototype airplanes one for four passenger twinengine aircraft and the other for six passenger twinengine aircraft tahawi shall engineer and design phase of the turboprop  and  seats aircrafts delays or cost overruns in the development or certification of the turboprop and failure of the product to meet its performance estimates could affect the company’s financial performance delays and increased costs may be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles changes to design or failure on the part of tahawi’s suppliers to deliver components as agreed operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond the company’s control tahawi intends to produce the turboprop  and  seats engines and components and parts developed and manufactured by thirdparty suppliers tahawi’s aircraft development and production could be affected by interruptions of production at such suppliers such suppliers may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations if any of these third parties experience difficulties it may have a direct negative impact on tahawi the company has one faa type certificate with modifications for  variations of prototype airplanes and will require additional faa certifications for its proposed  and  seats turboprop        the company has one faa type certificate a type certificate number aso ba with modifications for  variations of prototype airplanes certification which shall go into production immediately under the attained faa certificate and will need additional federal aviation administration certification for the two turboprop type aircrafts and the faa certification required for the sale of the tahawi’s turboprop aircrafts in the civil or commercial market in the united states the process to obtain such certification is expensive and time consuming and has inherent engineering risks these include but are not limited to ground test risks such as structural strength and fatigue resistance and structural flutter modes flight test risks include but are not limited to stability and handling over the desired centerofgravity range performance extremes stalls balkedlanding climb singleengine climb and flutter control effectiveness aircraft roll effectiveness controllability various control failure safety delays in faa certification might result in tahawi incurring increased costs in attempting to correct any issues causing such delays also the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on the turboprop certification or the costs of complying with such laws and regulations cannot be predicted since tahawi will not be permitted to deliver commercially produced turboprop aircraft to civilian customers until obtaining certification the only revenues will be generated from the existing certificate to fund the operations we depend on key personnel tahawi’s future success depends on the efforts of key personnel including its senior executive team tahawi does not currently carry any key man life insurance on its key personnel or its senior executive team however tahawi intends to obtain such insurance upon closing this offering regardless of such insurance the loss of services of any of these or other key personnel may have an adverse effect on tahawi there can be no assurance that tahawi will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel tahawi requires to develop and market the existing aircrafts and the proposed turboprop aircraft and conduct tahawi’s proposed operations the company’s estimates of market demand may be inaccurate tahawi has projected the market for its aircrafts upon a variety of internal and external market data the estimates involve significant assumptions which may not be realized in fact there can be no assurance that tahawi’s estimates for the number of aircraft that may be sold in the market will be as anticipated in the event that tahawi has not accurately estimated the market size for and the number of the aircrafts that may be sold it could have a material adverse effect upon tahawi its results from operations and an investment in the shares   there is no current market for the company’s shares there is no formal marketplace for the resale of tahawi’s common stock the shares may be traded on the overthecounter market to the extent any demand exists however we do not have plans to apply for or otherwise seek trading or quotation of the company’s shares on an overthecounter market investors should assume that they may not be able to liquidate their investment for some time or be able to pledge their shares as collateral                      dilution if you invest in our shares your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our capital stock after this offering the following table demonstrates the dilution that new investors will experience relative to the company’s net tangible book value as of september   of  net tangible book value is the aggregate amount of the company’s tangible assets less its total liabilities the table presents three scenarios a  million raise from this offering a  million raise from this offering and a fully subscribed  million raise from this offering      mm raise

another important way of looking at dilution is the dilution that happens due to future actions by the company the investor’s stake in a company could be diluted due to the company issuing additional shares in other words when the company issues more shares the percentage of the company that you own will go down even though the value of the company may go up you will own a smaller piece of a larger company this increase in number of shares outstanding could result from a stock offering such as an initial public offering another crowd funding round a venture capital round angel investment employees exercising stock options or by conversion of certain instruments eg convertible bonds preferred shares or warrants into stock  if the company decides to issue more shares an investor could experience value dilution with each share being worth less than before and control dilution with the total percentage an investor owns being less than before the company has authorized and issued only one class or type of shares common stock therefore all of the company’s current shareholders and the investors in this offering will experience the same dilution if the company decides to issue more shares in the future              plan of distribution and selling security holders no securities are being sold for the account of security holders all net proceeds of this offering will go to the

and the university of mississippi in the late seventies  unlike many of todays consumer commodities aircraft design is completely independent in many aspects the aerospace industry is using designs and features in the nasa shuttle programs that were conceived in the late sixties in modern aviation many of boeings designs from the sixties and seventies are still in use today the b serves as a tremendous example on january   fortune magazine reported the following  the war in afghanistan is the most high tech in history but among all the cuttingedge munitions you can still find a halfcenturyold military staple for five decades the workhorse of the us air force has remained the b bomber one of the oldestit celebrated its h birthday last novemberand the most reliable machines still active in our nations defense whats more the eightengine behemoth is slated to stay in service for at least another four decades no one expected that kind of longevity the b was conceived at the end of world war ii as an interim bomber a gigantic prop plane not even a jet that would soon be replaced by the fancier b six boeing engineers threw its final architecture together during a single weekend in  at the van cleve hotel in dayton since it was designed before computers removed all the guesswork  indeed before transistors were invented  the b was built so strong and with so many redundant systems that  it has been able to accommodate every alteration the air force has demanded of it  the first prototype rolled out of a seattle factory on nov   the same can be said for the aircraft manufactured by tahawi aerospace which are designed and built to be durable yet effective the airframe is rigid but not cumbersome without sacrificing its ability to carry load several aircraft brokers have reviewed the aircraft and all have come to the same conclusion the design is versatile and effective with many potential applications two working models were made although never massproduced the design was well ahead of its time and the features incorporated into the aircraft will make it a strong contender in todays marketplace the aircrafts design was made with the general aviation passenger use in mind employing a high ttail and rear entry doorway many aircraft companies have turned their attention to developing small jets these jets are attractive but have severe limitations with weight limits and fuel consumption tahawi’s aircraft are economical to operate in any country and the aircraft is easy to maintain the aircraft offers a more economical solution for corporate executives passenger services and cargo carriers a combination of the aircrafts features economic flexibility and readily available part supply makes the design internationally attractive the design is very adaptable to several operational needs the aircraft can be used to carry passengers in the general aviation market or alternatively carry cargo tahawis aircraft can carry an effective load a greater distance than most of its available competition in todays aviation marketplace the aircraft has the ability to land and takeoff on short and dirt runways while carrying cargo or passengers making it a powerful tool in remote locations as well as large hubs these attributes amount to a tool that is attractive to international buyers around the globe        mission statement tahawi aerospace aims to offer high quality low maintenance aircraft that will meet the demands of rapidly growing freight operations and general aviation the consumer will have the ability to attain a commercially applicable and state of the art aircraft while still remaining cost effective tahawi’s aerospace will compete with other premiumquality commercial aircraft manufacturers in the market tahawi management believes there is an opportunity within a currently untapped market due to many current providers being too diversified to serve the increasingly specialized needs of both commercial and general aviation industry segments as well as additional providers having focused their efforts and money into their stake in the small and inefficient private jet market tahawi has a welldesigned and faacertified aircraft with diverse applications which will be optimal in slotting into a void left by the current market value proposition about the product tahawi aircraft has a certified a type certificate for a six passenger aircraft the aircraft’s notable characteristics include a design that is compatible to an increase in size from  to  passengers a cruising speed beyond  mph at  power  lbs useful load capacity a comfortable cabin at  foot long and  foot  inches wide in comparison to the seneca v the tahawi has an additional useful load of  lbs larger cabin size superior range the ability to take off and land on shorter runways faster cruising speed tahawi’s aircraft is designed for high lift and low drag pilots that have flown the tahawi have stated the aircraft’s forgiving nature it is designed to be easy to fly and for great fuel economy tahawi has three separate designs that can be built  tahawi has the option to subcontract or manufacture in house the first design a twin engine  hp continental power plant with two blades this version will cruise at  mph and has the faa requirements the design will is certified by the faa and should be available for delivery in six calendar months a newer facility will be needed to produce the aircraft on a larger scale the second version will have additional horsepower and three blades this will add extra power for quicker takeoff on shorter runways and will increase the overall speed and performance the extra wing tip fuel tanks will add an additional  gallons of fuel and provide extended range while utilizing the same version tahawi aerospace will conduct research and development into the two later versions as work progresses on the first model to adhere to these timelines tahawi proposes to open a new manufacturing facility and aviation part distribution center in mississippi the company will start an onsite service and repair facility along with a flighttraining program to ensure that our customers are familiar with the safe flight operations of the aircraft tahawi will compile a strategic team of engineers technicians consultants manufacturing fabricators aviation part suppliers and other professionals in the mississippi area                  marketing strategy   tahawis marketing strategy will include the use of targeted print media advertising social media and direct sales to exporters in the united states and abroad to who provide aircraft to the international markets  we will capitalize on relationships with aircraft brokers who have communicated their willingness to recommend tahawis aircraft to domestic affiliates  we are positioned as a differentiated provider of the highest quality aircraft in today’s marketplace the primary goal of all marketing efforts will be to communicate this position to existing and potential customers   management tahawi is guided by a leadership team with decades of mael chief engineer experience our team possesses a deep well of expertise in fixed wing and vertical takeofflanding aircraft as well as a successful track record of bringing new aircraft to market tahawi has assembled a management team that includes aviation industry executives and professionals with decades of experience mr son bryant the original chief engineer that designed the aircraft is currently the coo of tahawi the company believes that this management team knows what is required to finance design certify and launch a program of this magnitude this management team brings to tahawi decades of sound management experience developing and executing strategic business and aircraft development plans as well as technical and financial expertise in enterprises of various scales in different businesses   market overview    aircraft shipments and billings according to “gama”   in   billion in new general aviation aircraft were delivered but yearend results were mixed across the market segments and among the manufacturers results were impacted by economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations in key general aviation markets such as brazil and europe as well as in emerging markets like china by contrast the north american market in particular the united states provided stronger delivery numbers a reason for cautious optimism piston airplane shipments were down in  the piston market has grown incrementally since  but declined by  in  compared to  from  to  shipments two thirds of piston shipments were to north american customers a significant increase from the  north american market share of  the asiapacific market was the second largest at  europe accounted for  of shipments piston rotorcraft shipments increased in  by  from  during the year the rotorcraft industry delivered  piston aircraft the delivery of turboprop airplanes also declined from  units in  to  units in  the north american market accounted for  of deliveries an increase from  the previous year turboprop shipment numbers remain strong in both the asiapacific region at  and in latin america at  by contrast europe saw its smallest market share for turboprop deliveries since gama started tracking regional shipment data in   the middle east and africa accounted for  of the market the preliminary turbine  results for rotorcraft industry point to a decline in civil shipments from  in  to  in  an  decline business jet shipments were mostly flat in  compared to  the industry shipped  business jets in  compared to  the year before the industry’s continued investment in new products helped maintain the delivery rate for business jets   turbine aircraft operators   the worldwide business aircraft fleet continued to grow in  according to jetnet llc at the end of  the turbine fleet consisted of  airplanes and  rotorcraft there was an additional  piston rotorcraft in operation the number of active operators is also growing at the end of  there were  business aircraft operators and  rotorcraft operators in operation after several years of decline the fractional aircraft fleet has stabilized according to jetnet llc in  there were  aircraft used in fractional operations up from  in  and the number of fractional owners was  a slight decline from  when there were  owners        source avdata inc by argus international  market drivers the recession from december  to june  had a massive impact on the general aviation ga aircraft manufacturing industry in  however the downward trend stopped and the number of aircraft sold increased by  worldwide from  in  to  in  shipments of aircraft manufactured in the us increased  from  in  to  in  in  worldwide production increased to  aircraft up  while the us output grew to  aircraft up  in  worldwide production declined to  aircraft down  while the us output was  aircraft down  source general aviation manufacturers association gama data commentary and analysis by forecast international and aeroweb due to the fallout of the financial crisis and the  recession sales of business jets and pistonengine aircraft collapsed and are as of  not even close to their  peak levels from  the global production of ga aircraft dropped a staggering  from  aircraft in  to  in  in the united states manufacturers experienced a  drop in production from  to  units   an important reason why deliveries of general aviation aircraft are still way below their  peak levels both worldwide and in the us is that the price per aircraft has doubled from  to  the average price of a pistonengine aircraft which is the most common type has soared from  in  to  today that increase is keeping thousands of would be buyers out of the market also the average price of a business jet is up from  million to  million over the same period at the same time the average price of turboprops has declined from  million to  million resulting in a surge in sales of this type of aircraft          revenue from general aviation aircraft delivered general aviation ga aircraft manufacturers have experienced a relatively modest drop in revenues relative to the massive drop in units shipped   from  revenues from the worldwide production of ga aircraft decreased  from  billion to  billion in the united states manufacturers experienced a much larger  drop in revenues from  billion in  to  billion in  in  revenues soared both in the us  and worldwide  in  revenues were down worldwide  but up in the us  relative to the major decrease in shipments revenues are almost back at prefinancial crisis levels manufacturers in the us have more than doubled the unit price of business jets since  between  and  prices went up a staggering  on average this is discussed in the chart following below   business jets make up the vast majority of us and worldwide sales revenues accounting for  and  of  sales respectively pistonengine aircraft account for only  of worldwide revenues and  in the us   average ga aircraft price  us and global   general aviation ga aircraft manufacturers have raised their prices dramatically to make up for declining sales volumes clearly manufacturers are aware that at low levels of demand a private aircraft is a very price inelastic type of product  thus prices can be raised without demand falling nearly as much        from  the average price of a ga aircraft worldwide almost doubled from  million to  million  us manufacturers also raised their prices although by only   million in  to  million in    prices went up every year from   peaking in  in  worldwide general aviation aircraft prices dropped  followed by a  decrease in  in  the average aircraft price was

attachments before making any decision regarding an investment in the company     it is difficult to forecast any projection based to an existing aircraft manufacturer and historical sales levels of similar aircraft because we don’t have a history of production in order to estimate the number of aircraft we believe we can sell each year we conducted a market analysis based on the performance characteristics relative to existing alternatives          to conduct the analysis we identified the likely objections that buyers of a particular type of aircraft would have when considering the purchase of our four and six passenger’s aircrafts we then estimated what percentage of those buyer segments would object to our type of aircrafts because of each of the considerations ie those that would object because it could not seat enough passengers or because it could not fly a long enough distance etc   this resulted in a percentage of each buyer segment that would not object to our four and six passenger’s aircraft relative to aircraft in that class leaving the expected portion of each market that we could capture with the potential share for each market estimated we then analyzed market forecast data from “gama” an industry leading market data organization this data identified the number of units by type of aircraft which are sold over the years applying the market share of each aircraft type we expect to capture to the number of aircraft expected to be delivered in each category per year we estimated that we can expect to sell between  –  aircraft each year this analysis only considered sales to civilian users and does not include military or commercial use forecasts   after completing our internal analysis our management team board of directors aviation marketing companies and other industry participants all reviewed those findings and provided input as to the reasonableness of the company’ conclusion or expectation of selling  of our four and six passenger’s aircraft each year based on the totality of the data and those conversations we feel that this estimate is achievable however for the purpose of creating our business plan we have assumed a lower more conservative number of annual aircraft deliveries   production plan and suppliers tahawi intends to use a horizontally integrated manufacturing strategy whereby the company maintains

certificate to manufacture the entire aircraft   we intend to utilize the professional networks of our executive team gained from decades of experience in the industry to secure favorable supply agreements with leading manufactures these suppliers will design and fabricate components to tahawi’s design specifications for incorporation into a final product the majority of these components will be largely offtheshelf systems used in other aircraft with only limited customization or design features that are specifically required for our aircrafts  employees and consultants the company has the expertise of the original chief engineer whom he designed mael aircraft mr son bryant he is currently the coo and chief engineer of tahawi aerospace the company intends to hire a number of employees after the offering primarily to support our engineering manufacturing and development efforts   aviation regulations in the us civil aviation is regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” which controls virtually every aspect of flight from pilot licensing to aircraft design and construction the faa requires that every civilian aircraft that flies in the us must carry a valid type certificate and airworthiness certificate issued by the faa or a foreign civil aviation authority   the company currently has one faa type certificate with modifications for two variations of prototype airplanes one for four passengers twinengine aircraft and the other for six passengers twinengine aircraft the company will seek to obtain approval for the design of  and  passenger turboprops under the federal aviation regulations the faa will conduct extensive testing and analysis of the company’s new design to determine the safety stability reliability and performance of the aircraft and that the aircraft complies with the applicable airworthiness standards        the faa also issues standard airworthiness certificates to each aircraft that is manufactured in accordance with an approved design or type certificate rather than test each aircraft that is built the faa allows manufacturers to prove that their manufacturing process and quality control system produces conforming aircraft each time only a company that owns a type certificate is entitled to this authorization called a production certificate if the faa approves of tahawi’s manufacturing process the company will be issued a production certificate and each aircraft manufactured by tahawi in accordance with the type certificate will receive an airworthiness certificate intellectual property the company’s intellectual property includes the faa a type certificate number aso  ba blueprint the acquired nasa study design and trade secrets the faa certification in considered intellectual property

six and the  passages aircrafts and the limited cargo aircrafts it determined that existing aircraft are highly priced and not fuel efficient tahawi believes that offering a product that  cheaper and cost effective in this niche markets is highly needed tahawi aerospace corp is seeking to initially manufacture the two variations of its faa certified prototype propeller aircrafts one for four passengers twinengine aircraft and the other for six passengers twinengine aircraft the design was originally conceived by a collaboration of nasa and the university of mississippi in the late seventies  unlike many of todays consumer commodities aircraft design is completely different in many aspects the aerospace industry is using designs and features in the nasa shuttle programs that were conceived in the late s in aviation many of the designs of boeing from the s and s are in use today the company will seek to obtain approval for the design of six and ten passenger turboprop aircraft under the federal aviation regulations the faa will conduct extensive testing and analysis of the company’s new design to determine the safety stability reliability and performance of the aircraft and that the aircraft complies with the applicable airworthiness standards   one only has to look at the b fortune magazine january   reported the following­ the war in afghanistan is the most high tech in history but among all the cuttingedge munitions you can still find a halfcenturyold military staple for five decades the workhorse of the us air force has remained the b bomber one of the oldestit celebrated its h birthday last novemberand the most reliable machines still active in our nations defense whats more the eightengine behemoth is slated to stay in service for at least another four decades no one expected that kind of longevity the b was conceived at the end of world war ii as an interim bomber a gigantic prop plane not even a jet that would soon be replaced by the fancier b six boeing engineers threw its final architecture together during a single weekend in  at the van cleve hotel in dayton since it was designed before computers removed all the guesswork  indeed before transistors were invented  the b was built so strong and with so many redundant systems that  it has been able to accommodate every alteration the air force has demanded of it  the first prototype rolled out of a seattle factory on nov     the same can be said for the tahawi aerospace aircrafts it is strong and the airframe was designed to last the construction of airframe is solid and the gross weight and lifting ability is remarkable several aircraft brokers have reviewed the aircraft and have all admitted the same conclusions this is a versatile and useful design that has many applications two working models were made and never massproduced the design was well ahead of its time and the features incorporated into the airplane will make it a strong contender in todays marketplace          the aircraft has a high t tail and a rear entry doorway the design was for general aviation passenger use many aircraft companies have turned their attention to developing small jets these jets are attractive but have severe limitations with weight limits and fuel consumption the tahawi’s are economical to operate in any country and the aircraft is easy to maintain parts are readably available and these features make this design an international attraction the airplane offers a more economical solution for corporate executives passenger services and cargo carriers   the design is very adaptable to several operational needs the airplane can be used as a passenger aircraft in the general aviation market or as a cargo aircraft tahawis airplane can carry a useful load a greater distance than most of its competition available in todays aviation marketplace the airplane can utilize very remote airports with dirt or short runways and transport equipment andor passengers into larger hubs  internationally these features will make these aircraft very attractive to potential buyers   tahawi aerospace aims to offer high quality low maintenance aircraft that will meet the requirements of a rapidly growing demand for freight operations and general aviation the consumer will have the ability to have a state of the art aircraft with commercial applications at a cost effective price   tahawi’s will compete with other premiumquality commercial aircraft manufacturers in the market the management of tahawi’s believes there is a current untapped market opportunity because  existing providers of aircraft are too diversified to serve the increasingly specialized needs of the commercial and general aviation industry segments  the other competitors have focused their energy and money in developing the small and inefficient private jet market and  tahawi’s has a well designed and certified aircraft with various uses   liquidity and capital resources   as of september   the company had  in cash and total liabilities of  as of november   the company has incurred total expenses since inception of  related to the reg a filing expenses associated with this offering  we are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation the company hopes to raise  in this offering if we are successful at raising the maximum amount of this offering we believe that such funds will be sufficient to fund our project over the next three years and achieve significant growth although we planning a major marketing and development approach there is no guarantee that we will be successful our plan will depend highly on our funds the availability of those funds and the success of our implementation upon the qualification of the form a the company plans to pursue the implementation of our manufacturing plan there can be no assurance of the companys ability to do so or that additional capital will be available to the company if so the companys investment objective of the manufacturing plan will be adversely affected and the company may not be able to pursue its goals if it is unable to finance such plan the company currently has no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans lines of credit or any other sources since the company has no such arrangements or plans currently in effect its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on its ability to implement its plan there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the company if we are successful at raising capital by issuing more stock or securities which are convertible into shares of the company your investment will be diluted as a result of such issuance          we are dependent upon the success of this offering to achieve our planned project as described herein therefore the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans which would likely not even be possible for the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operation to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities or secure a loan the company would be required to scale back its rapid growth plan   plan of operations the company has developed a detailed plan to complete its preliminary manufacturing phase hire key members of its management team expand sales and marketing efforts and complete detailed design and development work to support the production of the flying six and four passengers’ propeller aircrafts under the current faa certification we are able to enter into production immediately if we are successful in raising capital in this offering our  and  passenger turboprop is expected to take approximately  to  years to be certified by the faa and produce the exact time and cost to secure faa certification and commence production is not known but we estimate that it will take  to  years and require at least  million in additional funding after completion of the proof of concept we are now seeking  million in funding from this regulation a offering to fund our  year plan to produce the current faa certified  and  passengers propeller aircrafts and   the  and  passenger turboprops after certification by the faa    upon completion of this offering the company will focus its resources in four key areas  i cash payment for mael assets acquisition ii equipping the manufacturing operation the assembly line iii hiring key members of the management team iv continuing development of the  and  seats turboprop aircrafts and v development of the manufacturing facility we will develop an internal and external sales and marketing capability to increase awareness of the aircraft and position the company to begin taking refundable customer deposits and presales orders this will be accomplished with the following milestones     will initiate our sales and marketing efforts     build our  and  passengers propeller aircrafts     attend and exhibit at one major international trade show     receive nonrefundable deposit orders for the  and  passengers propeller aircrafts we believe that increasing awareness of the aircraft and demonstrating customer demand through orders will enable the company to raise additional capital in the future more easily the company will be able to use the nonrefundable deposits to produce the currently certified  and  passengers’ propeller aircrafts the milestones identified above assume that we are able to raise the full  million from this offering in that event the company would expect to accomplish all of the above milestones within the first  months however we have developed our spending plans in each of these areas to be scalable to the amount of money that we raise in this offering as a result we do not anticipate needing to raise additional funds in the  years after the completion of this offering                      directors executive officers and significant employees tahawi has assembled an
