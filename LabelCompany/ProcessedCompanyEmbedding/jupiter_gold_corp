obtains mineral claim in paracatu by adam mccluster  september     share facebook twitter brazil minerals inc otcmktsbmix revealed on monday that subsidiary jupiter gold corp had acquired a gold mineral claim covering  acres in paracatu it is situated  miles from the alluvial gold and diamond operations of the company morro de ouro paracatu is home to morro do ouro the biggest gold mine in brazil owned by kinross gold corporation usa nysekgc according to a  report the gold mine has a total of  million oz in proven and probable reserves of gold and a total of  oz of gold in annual production paracatu has been a primary gold mining destination since the th century production typically comes from alluvial deposits near the corrego do ouro or corrego do rico river stream prior to obtaining the mineral claim for gold jupiter gold had been offered a simple gold production operation using centrifuges downstream from morro do ouro for about  million however the company had declined the offer enabling it to identify a more desirable claim upstream and closer to morro do ouro crixas exploration license last month jupiter gold had also been granted with a priority for an exploration license on a gold mineral right which covers a total of  acres in crixas— one of the biggest gold production sites in the region the area is  miles away from the company’s alluvial gold and diamond operations in brazil the claim can potentially demonstrate primary gold ore linked with pyrite or chalcopyrite and unveil a secondary gold deposit in alluvium and oxidized surface rock the company expects to receive the official license in a couple of weeks by then jupiter gold is permitted— initially for three years— to conduct substantial research that will establish the feasibility of gold production in the area financial update in other news brazil minerals revealed recently that it had eliminated a massive convertible debt and preferred stock from its balance sheet further
