one result is that there is no longer the exchange of information that used to take place which in turn makes it more difficult to collect accurate information although production has been increasing panama had been exporting smaller quantities in recent years and has even been importing refined sugar for example in  panama imported  tons of refined sugar with a value of  million from mexico and

imported over  eggs for incubation during  mainly from the united states the poultry industry continues growing at a strong pace covering local demand and allowing exports to central america and the

curazao and a smaller quantity to san andres colombia the total including whole parts and offal amounted to approximately  panama exported  worth of turkeys to curazao panama produces approximately  commercial eggs per day production and export of fertile eggs is picking up since high quality of breeders from panama is gaining recognition panama exported  million worth of eggs for incubation in  mainly to central america and also to colombia vegetablesedit panamanian vegetable production is concentrated in the highlands of chiriqui province until recently there has been little competition with the result that there has been scant incentive in improve production and marketing techniques moreover little thought given to the consumer with prices often high and quality low this situation created an opportunity for dependable suppliers of high quality produce over the past year as panama has gradually shifted its trade policies to more open markets local importers have started bringing

conditions panama normally produces an average of  tons of sorghum per year which is sold to industries that process animal foodstuffs this supplies about  of total demand farmers use only a low level of technology and expect that industries will acquire the grain immediately after harvest since farmers do not have sufficient storage capacity for the entire harvest they are at a disadvantage when marketing their product in a hurry moreover with international prices usually lower than local prices industries prefer to import the grain historyedit for centuries agriculture was the dominant

of which forests account for  million hectares followed by pasture land  million hectares and permanently cultivated fields  hectares about  percent of the land was used for roads and urban areas nearly all of the cultivated and pasture land was originally forested a large amount of virgin land has been opened up for cultivation by the panamerican highway panamas climate and geology impose major constraints on the development of agriculture heavy rainfall throughout the year prevents cultivation of most crops on the atlantic side of the continental divide the pacific side has a dry season december to april and accounts for most of the cultivated land the mountainous terrain also restricts cropping in addition panama does not have high quality soils most of the areas classified as cultivable are so considered on the assumption that farmers will practice conservation measures but many do not the topsoil is thin in most areas and erosion is a serious problem most of the nearly level areas conducive to cultivation are in the provinces of los santos coclé veraguas and chiriquí slash and burn agricultureedit a further constraint on production is the practice of slashandburn cultivation in which trees brush and weeds are cut and then burned on the patch of ground selected for cultivation indians utilized the slashandburn method for centuries and the spanish made few changes in techniques in the s most farmers practiced a slashandburn type of shifting cultivation the thin and poorquality topsoil yielded an initially good harvest followed by a smaller harvest the second year typically the land was cultivated for only two years and then the farmer repeated the process on another plot allowing the first plot to rest ten years before refarming much of the farming

clearing weeding and harvesting were accomplished with a few kinds of knives principally the machete and the axe which comprised the major farm implements land tenure and agrarian reformedit before the s land was readily available to anyone who was willing to clear and plant a plot the cutting and clearing of forests greatly accelerated as the population increased by the s subsistence farmers sometimes reduced the rest period of cleared plots from ten years of fallow to as few as five years because of the inavailability of farm land the reduced fallow period diminished soil fertility and harvests consequently cropped acreage peaked during the s the hard life and low income farmers accelerated the exodus of workers from the countryside to the cities the long period when new land was easily obtainable contributed to a casual attitude toward land titles in   percent of the  farms had such titles the decline in available agricultural land has made land titling more necessary moreover insecure tenure has been a particularly severe constraint to improved techniques and to commercial crop production the cost of titling a piece of land has been too high for most subsistence farmers between  and  the government attempted to redistribute land in the late s the distribution of land and farm incomes remained very unequal in   percent of farms had an annual income below us the issue of unequal land distribution has not been as explosive in panama as in many other latin american countries this was because of the serviceoriented nature of the economy and because about half of the population lived in or near panama city also about  percent of all farm land was owneroperated and virtually all rural families owned or occupied a plot in an effort to redistribute land the government acquired  hectares of land and expropriated an additional  percent of the land about threequarters of the land acquired was in the provinces of veraguas and panamá by  over  families about  percent of rural families in the  census had access to either individual plots or collectively held land as a result of the redistribution the land acquisition created uncertainty and adversely affected private investment in agriculture slowing production in the s as part of its agrarian reform the government placed heavy emphasis on organizing farmers into collectives for agricultural development several organizational forms were available the two most important being asentamientos settlements and juntas agrarias de producción agrarian production associations the distinctions between the two were minor and became even more blurred with time both encouraged pooling of land and cooperative activity in some instances land was worked collectively other organizational forms included marketing cooperatives state farms and specialized producers cooperatives for milk chickens or pigs growth of these agricultural organizations slowed by the mids and some disbanded as emphasis shifted to consolidation the cost of agrarian reform was high the government channeled large amounts of economic aid to organized farmers rural credit was greatly increased farm machinery was made available improved seeds and other inputs were supplied and technical assistance was provided cooperative farm yields increased but these higher yields were not impressive considering the level of investment despite the high costs of the government programs incomes of cooperative farmers remained low after the mids the government changed its policy toward cooperatives and stressed efficiency and productivity instead of equity although the economic results of agrarian reform were disappointing the social conditions of most farmers improved the number of rural residents with access to safe water increased by  percent between  and  improved sewerage facilities community health programs and rural clinics reduced mortality rates considerably major expansion of educational facilities

longer the exchange of information that used to take place which in turn makes it more difficult to collect accurate information although production has been increasing panama had been exporting smaller quantities in recent years and has even been importing refined sugar for example in  panama imported  tons of refined sugar with a value of  million from mexico and  tons with a value of  from colombia both refined sugar bananasedit main article banana production in panama in  the value of banana exports from panama was  million shrimpedit with approximately  shrimp farms covering an area of  hectares combined with efficient high technology and good management practices the panamanian shrimp farming industry is responsible for  of fish products exports this amounted to a total of  million exported during  in that year shrimp exports were bigger than traditional banana exports for the first time coffeeedit drying coffee beans in boquete for the export season ending in  panama generated  million in sales the majority of these exports went to the us with canada europe and asia being purchasers as well livestockedit the main livestock products in panama are beef veal chicken and pork panama has the highest rate of chicken consumption per capita in latin america cattleedit cattle being herded in panama as of  there were  head of cattle in panama that year panama slaughtered  head and exported  head panama only imported  head of breeding cattle during  panama exported  million of beef products in  and imported  million poultry and eggsedit average annual poultry slaughter is  million birds which yield approximately  mt of poultry meat panama imported  million worth of poultry meat during  while exporting  million panama imported over  eggs for incubation during  mainly from the united states the poultry industry continues growing at a strong pace covering local demand and allowing exports to central america and the caribbean panama depends on imported corn to feed its flocks and thereby the competitiveness of its poultry production is dependent on the world price of feed grains in  panama exported mainly to curazao and a smaller quantity to san andres colombia the total including whole parts and offal amounted to approximately  panama exported  worth of turkeys to curazao panama produces approximately  commercial eggs per day production and export of fertile eggs is picking up since high quality of breeders from panama is gaining recognition panama exported  million worth of eggs for incubation in  mainly to central america and also to colombia vegetablesedit panamanian vegetable production is concentrated in the highlands of chiriqui province until recently there has been little competition with the result that there has been scant incentive in improve production and marketing techniques moreover little thought given to the consumer with prices often high and quality low this situation created an opportunity for dependable suppliers of high quality produce over the past year as panama has gradually shifted its trade policies to more open markets local importers have started bringing in increasing quantities of produce particularly from the united states beansedit panama has been a traditional importer of lentils dry beans and kidney beans there is some domestic kidney bean production that supplies much of the market when international prices climb and compete for the market the rest of the time there is no lentil production in panama and no demand for black beans forestryedit panama has significant stocks of timber mainly mahogany there are also  hectares of planted forests mainly teak and pine however concerns over deforestation have led to increased regulation of the timber industry during the s panama annually lost  percent of its forested areas to logging however after  timber production dropped by  percent there are  major timber companies which own  sawmills annual output is now around  cubic meters of forest products other grainsedit panamanian corn production including both mechanized and nonmechanized production was  tons in  panama imported  tons all from the united states use for human consumption amounted to  tons and for animal production  tons there is no wheat barley or oat production in panama due to unfavorable climatic conditions panama normally produces an average of  tons of sorghum per year which is sold to industries that process animal foodstuffs this supplies about  of total demand farmers use only a low level of technology and expect that industries will acquire the grain immediately after harvest since farmers do not have sufficient storage capacity for the entire harvest they are at a disadvantage when marketing their product in a hurry moreover with international prices usually lower than local prices industries prefer to import the grain historyedit for centuries agriculture was the dominant economic activity for most of panamas population after construction of the panama canal agriculture fell as a proportion of total gdp agriculture represented  percent of panamanian gdp in  and just over  percent in  in  agriculture and fisheries made up  of panamas gdp agriculture employs a large number of panamanians in relation to its percentage of panamas gdp because many farmers are engaged in subsistence farming the percentage of panamas labor force in agriculture has fallen from  percent in  to  percent in  between  and  the government undertook agrarian reform and attempted to redistribute land the expanded role of the state in agriculture improved social conditions in rural areas but long term economic gains arising from the agrarian reform were modest in  crops accounted for  percent of value added in agriculture followed by livestock  percent fishing  percent and forestry  percent despite its relative decline agriculture was the main supplier of commodities for export accounting for over  percent of total export earnings in  the agricultural sector satisfied most of the domestic demand the principal food imports were wheat and wheat products because climatic conditions precluded wheat cultivation in  the value of food imports was us million  percent of total imports with half of that being food exports in the early and mids the government sought to reverse the decline of agriculture by diversifying agricultural production lowering protection barriers and reducing the states role in agriculture in march  the government instituted major changes in the agricultural incentives law and removed price controls trade restrictions farm subsidies and other supports throughout the s agricultural production increased by an average of  percent per year with the exception of  when hurricane mitch caused extensive damage to crops in  agricultural exports were valued at us million out of panamas total exports of  million while imports totaled us million that same year bananas accounted for  percent of panamas exports shrimp  percent sugar  percent and coffee  percent in  sugar cane production was at  million metric tons bananas at  metric tons rice at  metric tons and corn at  metric tons the main export crop was bananas with exports worth us million in  there has been a steady increase in tropical fruit exports which were worth us million in  land useedit a map of economic activity in panama including agriculture  about half of the land in panama is used for agriculture panamas land area totals approximately  million hectares of which forests account for  million hectares followed by pasture land  million hectares and permanently cultivated fields  hectares about  percent of the land was used for roads and urban areas nearly all of the cultivated and pasture land was originally forested a large amount of virgin land has been opened up for cultivation by the panamerican highway panamas climate and geology impose major constraints on the development of agriculture heavy rainfall throughout the year prevents cultivation of most crops on the atlantic side of the continental divide the pacific side has a dry season december to april and accounts for most of the cultivated land the mountainous terrain also restricts cropping in addition panama does not have high quality soils most of the areas classified as cultivable are so considered on the assumption that farmers will practice conservation measures but many do not the topsoil is thin in most areas and erosion is a serious problem most of the nearly level areas conducive to cultivation are in the provinces of los santos coclé veraguas and chiriquí slash and burn agricultureedit a further constraint on production is the practice of slashandburn cultivation in which trees brush and weeds are cut and then burned on the patch of ground selected for cultivation indians utilized the slashandburn method for centuries and the spanish made few changes in techniques in the s most farmers practiced a slashandburn type of shifting cultivation the thin and poorquality topsoil yielded an initially good harvest followed by a smaller harvest the second year typically the land was cultivated for only two years and then the farmer repeated the process on another plot allowing the first plot to rest ten years before refarming much of the farming was of a subsistence nature and accomplished with a minimum of equipment plowing was generally not practiced on subsistence farms the seeds were placed in holes made by a stick tree cutting land clearing weeding and harvesting were accomplished with a few kinds of knives principally the machete and the axe which comprised the major farm implements land tenure and agrarian reformedit before the s land was readily available to anyone who was willing to clear and plant a plot the cutting and clearing of forests greatly accelerated as the population increased by the s subsistence farmers sometimes reduced the rest period of cleared plots from ten years of fallow to as few as five years because of the inavailability of farm land the reduced fallow period diminished soil fertility and harvests consequently cropped acreage peaked during the s the hard life and low income farmers accelerated the exodus of workers from the countryside to the cities the long period when new land was easily obtainable contributed to a casual attitude toward land titles in   percent of the  farms had such titles the decline in available agricultural land has made land titling more necessary moreover insecure tenure has been a particularly severe constraint to improved techniques and to commercial crop production the cost of titling a piece of land has been too high for most subsistence farmers between  and  the government attempted to redistribute land in the late s the distribution of land and farm incomes remained very unequal in   percent of farms had an annual income below us the issue of unequal land distribution has not been as explosive in panama as in many other latin american countries this was because of the serviceoriented nature of the economy and because about half of the population lived in or near panama city also about  percent of all farm land was owneroperated and virtually all rural families owned or occupied a plot in an effort to redistribute land the government acquired  hectares of land and expropriated an additional  percent of the land about threequarters of the land acquired was in the provinces of veraguas and panamá by  over  families about  percent of rural families in the  census had access to either individual plots or collectively held land as a result of the redistribution the land acquisition created uncertainty and adversely affected private investment in agriculture slowing production in the s as part of its agrarian reform the government placed heavy emphasis on organizing farmers into collectives for agricultural development several organizational forms were available the two most important being asentamientos settlements and juntas agrarias de producción agrarian production associations the distinctions between the two were minor and became even more blurred with time both encouraged pooling of land and cooperative activity in some instances land was worked collectively other organizational forms included marketing cooperatives state farms and specialized producers cooperatives for milk chickens or pigs growth of these agricultural organizations slowed by the mids and some disbanded as emphasis shifted to consolidation the cost of agrarian reform was high the government channeled large amounts of economic aid to organized farmers rural credit was greatly increased farm machinery was made available improved seeds and other inputs were supplied and technical assistance was provided cooperative farm yields increased but these higher yields were not impressive considering the level of investment despite the high costs of the government programs incomes of cooperative farmers remained low after the mids the government changed its policy toward cooperatives and stressed efficiency and productivity instead of equity although the economic results of agrarian reform were disappointing the social conditions of most farmers improved the number of rural residents with access to safe water increased by  percent between  and  improved sewerage facilities community health programs and rural clinics reduced mortality rates considerably major expansion of educational facilities including education programs for rural residents helped rural panamanians become better educated and more mobile international businessedit several large international companies dominate panamanian exports especially when it comes to export crops such as bananas for instance the us company chiriqui land company which operates under the brand name chiquita is one of the largest landowners in panama as well as the main banana

nearly half of the countrys  million people panama was inhabited by several indigenous tribes prior to settlement by the spanish in the th century panama broke away from spain in  and joined a union

the backing of the united states panama seceded from colombia in  allowing the panama canal to be built by the us army corps of engineers between  and  in  an agreement was signed for the total

named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of american natives the indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases which had been chronic in eurasian populations for centuries conquest to edit vasco núñez de balboa a recognized and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops postcolonial panamaedit see also panama–colombia separation hay–bunauvarilla treaty panamanian general election  and history of panama – us president theodore roosevelt sitting on a steam

attempts to secede and came close to success in  and again during the thousand days war of – the thousand days war is understood among indigenous panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of victoriano lorenzo the us intention to influence the area especially the panama canals construction and control led to the separation of panama from colombia in  and its establishment as

name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population

and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops postcolonial panamaedit see also panama–colombia separation hay–bunauvarilla treaty panamanian general election  and history of panama – us president

name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of american natives the indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases which had been chronic in eurasian populations for centuries conquest to edit vasco núñez de balboa a recognized and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops postcolonial panamaedit see also panama–colombia separation hay–bunauvarilla treaty panamanian general election  and history of panama – us president

name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of american natives the indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases which had been chronic in eurasian populations for centuries conquest to edit vasco núñez de balboa a recognized and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops postcolonial panamaedit see also panama–colombia separation hay–bunauvarilla treaty panamanian general election  and history of panama – us president

a struggle for land rights under the leadership of victoriano lorenzo the us intention to influence the area especially the panama canals construction and control led to the separation of panama from

name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of american natives the indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases which had been chronic in eurasian populations for centuries conquest to edit vasco núñez de balboa a recognized and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops postcolonial panamaedit see also panama–colombia separation hay–bunauvarilla treaty panamanian general election  and history of panama – us president

name panama some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree sterculia apetala the panama tree others believe that the first settlers arrived in panama in august when butterflies abound and that the name means many butterflies in an indigenous language the bestknown version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name panamá which meant an abundance of fish captain antonio tello de guzmán while exploring the pacific side in  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town in  don gaspar de espinosa a spanish lieutenant decided to settle a post there in  pedrarias dávila decided to establish the empires pacific city in this site the new settlement replaced santa maría la antigua del darién which had lost its function within the crowns global plan after the beginning of the spanish exploitation of the riches in the pacific blending all of the above together panamanians believe in general that the word panama means abundance of fish trees and butterflies this is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the ministry of education in panama however others believe the word panama comes from the kuna word bannaba which means distant or far away historyedit main article history of panama at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the th century the known inhabitants of panama included the cuevas and the coclé tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular regional routes of commerce when panama was colonized the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population

and popular figure of panamanian history new caledonia the illfated scottish darien scheme colony in the bay of caledonia west of the gulf of darien rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred

tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular

in  in search of gold and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama a year later christopher columbus visited the isthmus and established a shortlived settlement in the darien vasco núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred

entry may be extended for up to one year there are two options for temporary entry first the goods can enter the country if the importer makes a deposit equivalent to the import duty this payment will be reimbursed at the time the goods leave the country second an insurance company can issue a bond for the importer covering the import duty value payable if the goods fail to exit the country as scheduled special temporary provisions apply in the case of trade shows and exhibitions taking place at panamas exhibition and convention center atlapa goods can enter the atlapa convention center with no warranty payment or bond required samples with commercial value are subject to temporary entry requirements samples with no commercial value are admitted duty free if samples arrive in large

basis the ad valorem system uses the declared cif value as the basis for import duty calculations and in some cases utilizes historical price information as a reference in addition to the duty all imports into panama are subject to a  percent transfer or value added tax itbm levied on the cif value plus import duty and other handling charges pharmaceuticals foods and school supplies are exempt from the itbm tax due to the tpa between the us and panama some  of us products enter panama duty free for other products duties may be phased out over time since there are a number of exceptions it is convenient to check what products are under duty free regime we suggest that us exporters go through the following process to determine duties today and in the future customs info database  shows you tariffsduties that panama is currently assessing you can access this database by simply signing up with your email address note panama already allows dutyfree imports for certain projects eg canal expansion or metro construction please contact us for more information on these exceptions tariff tool for free trade agreements – shows you how tariffs will be phased out for any particular good in any country that has a free trade agreement current or pending with the us cautionary note this tool does not show agricultural products in addition it is not completely accurate for current tariff rates instead it shows what panama is allowed to charge which may be higher if you are selling a product with us content even if it is being sold through the colón free zone to other countries in latin america it is worth documenting the content of origin doing so makes your products more profitable if sold not only in panama but through the colón free zone to other countries in latin america

overview walking tours planning a trip active pursuits spectator sports book hotels panama city shopping advertisement youll hear a lot of talk about dutyfree shopping in panama but it is exaggerated really the only place you can dutyfree shop is at the plethora of stores at the tocumen airport shopping complexes such as the flamingo center on the amador causeway limit dutyfree purchases to cruisers landing at their port even the dutyfree zone in colón is overrated as most wholesalers do not sell to independent travelers the major shopping malls here offer excellent quality and national and international brands though prices are comparable to those in the united states a principal shopping avenue is vía españa where both high and lowend shops vie for business as well as grocery stores and pharmacies designer stores are located around calle  in marbella and in the nearby world trade centers centro de comercio also try plaza paitilla in the paitilla neighborhood youll find electronics shops around vía estronga in the financial district modern shopping malls globalization and the rising demand for highquality products have shifted the shopping scene to spacious megamalls that house international brands cinemas and a food court multiplaza pacific tel  offers the most in terms of selection and quality yet it is the most expensive in town colombianowned multicentro tel  conveniently located across from the radisson on avenida balboa has a number of latindivastyle boutiques theres also a cinema and a casino albrook mall tel  is an airconditioned shrine to lowcost outlet shopping but youll have to do a lot of digging around to find a gem because it is next to the bus terminal it is busy with families who arrive from the interior of panama ready to shop there is a cinema at albrook mall too wildlife contraband dont destroy what youve come seeking international laws prohibit the trade of endangered plants or animals or products made from endangered wildlife yet many travelers to panama who purchase such goods rarely realize that what they are doing is illegal nor do they understand the consequences of their purchase illegal trade destroys the very wildlife and habitat that travelers come here to enjoy you could also set yourself up for being issued a heavy fine by lawenforcement officials upon your return to help with wildlife conservation ask yourself do i know what this product is made of do i know where this product came from do i need a special permit to bring this product home the world wildlife funds trade monitoring network traffic and the us fish and wildlife service have a series of buyer beware brochures including one aimed at travelers in the caribbean that you can download from their site at wwwworldwildlifeorgbuyerbeware when in panama you should avoid purchasing products made from turtle shell including jewelry leather products made from reptile skins live birds including parrots macaws and toucans live monkeys certain coral products orchids except those grown commercially markets the mercado de mariscos located on avenida balboa and calle  este is distribution headquarters for fresh seafood pulled from the pacific and caribbean its a vibrant market with lots of action as fishmongers shout while they deftly fillet corvina tuna octopus and more you can dine here at their upstairs restaurant several food stands sell seafood snacks like ceviche next door is the brandnew mercado público the covered farmers market of panama city with exotic fruits and vegetables meats dried spices and nuts and a food court of fondas or cheap food stands serving panamanian fare dont forget to bring your camera artesanía or indigenous handicrafts are the numberone buy here in panama with the exception of real estate molas the reversed appliqué panels made by kuna indian women rank high on the list of popularity for souvenirs and gifts either sewn onto a beach bag as a shirt or sold individually for you to frame or stitch onto anything youd like pillowcases are an ideally sized canvas other popular handicrafts such as tagua nuts or vegetable ivory carved into tiny figurines ngobebuglé dresses and emberá indian baskets and masks can be found at the following markets these markets do not have phones and all are open daily with the general hours  or am to  or pm until about pm sun the mercado nacional de artesanías in panama viejo next to the visitor center is expansive and sells handicrafts from around the country in balboa on avenida arnulfo arias madrid and amador is a small ymca handicrafts market with mostly kuna and emberá indigenous arts and crafts and clothing a little farther east and up avenida arnulfo arias madrid is the kuna cooperative featuring kuna handicrafts this market is fun for kids because kuna women offer to affix their traditional beaded bands onto the arms and legs of tourists just as they themselves wear them for the more adventurous traveler seeking an authentic shopping experience you cant beat avenida central a pedestrian street and market that stretches from where justo arosemena meets vía españa to the santa ana plaza and that is near casco viejo its a scrappy rundown neighborhood with cheap stores outdoor fruit and vegetable markets and a bustling fusion of ethnic groups shopping for a bargain visually its the most colorful neighborhood in town apart from  £pandunder kind of shops vendors lining the streets hawk clothing accessories plastic gizmos and knickknacks shopkeepers like to blare music or announce their deals through megaphones to pull buyers in its a slice of everyday panama but its also street theater and peoplewatching as fascinating as catching sight of kuna indian women lining up at mcdonalds dont wander too far off avenida central and keep an eye on your personal belongings this area is patrolled by police and is generally safe during the day the brandnew flamenco shopping plaza is on the amador causeway tel  wwwfuerteamadorcom hours are variable but generally noonpm it caters predominantly to cruisers docking here but shops are open to the general public except the dutyfree shop the plaza is a highend onestop shopping area for souvenirs jewelry and upscale handicrafts come prepared visit their website and print out their discount coupons worth a savings of  to  depending on the store art galleries the following art galleries showcase panamanian contemporary artists and other wellknown latin american artists check wwwthepanamanewscom and its calendar listing for upcoming shows and special events galería bernheim at calle  and calle alquilino in the financial district tel  has a lengthy roster of paintings and other artwork for sale as well as antique maps and delicately carved tagua nuts imagen galería de arte located at calle  and calle  tel  displays mostly paintings and sculpture by local artists and offers professional framing galería y enmarcado habitante at calle  and uruguay has a small collection and is worth stopping at only if youre in the bella vista neighborhood they also offer framing as the name states arts  antiques tel  sells antiques and art antiques representing spanish colonial art deco victorian and other epochs the store is located in the balboa plaza on avenida balboa at calle anastacio ruiz handicrafts the widest selection of handicrafts in panama city can be found at one of several markets otherwise an outstanding selection of molas can be found at flory saltzman molas located at calle  b oeste tel  wwwflorymolascom flory also sells bedspreads made of sewntogether molas but the laborious work required for such an extensive intricate piece of work means youll pay top dollar another designer handicraft boutique is breebaart at calle  and calle  tel  owned by one hélène breebaart who came to panama as a representative of christian dior  years ago and stayed on breebaart creates designer fashion and accessories that incorporate contemporary looks with kuna art she has a crew of kuna seamstresses onsite mostly for panamas rich and prominent women there are some things for sale here but breebaarts specialty is custommade pieces that take about a week to make the gran morrison varietydepartment store chain located at vía españa and calle  este tel  and in punta paitilla tel  has a selection of handicrafts in casco viejo two stores sell indigenous crafts and other panamathemed souvenirs galería de arte indígena at  calle a tel  daily ampm sells highquality indigenous arts and crafts and features folkloric dancing on friday and saturday nights from  to pm down the road from the galería on calle era in casco viejo is the shop la ronda tel  daily ampm with an outstanding selection of highquality arts and crafts hats and paintings there are shops at the mi pueblito cultural center but the selection is better elsewhere those looking for more upscale souvenirs and precolumbian reproductions should head to la reprosa with locations on ave samuel lewis and calle  tel  and in casco antiguo edificio art deco ave a tel  its pricey but quality is high panama hats not very panamanian after all  despite the name panama hats did not originate in panama but in ecuador and were traditionally made by the ecuadorian indigenous group from the manabí province using fibers from the toquilla palm the hat was first popularized by ferdinand de lesseps during the french canal effort and later during the canal building by the us when thousands were imported from ecuador and given to workers for protection from the blistering tropical sun hence the name panama hat stuck the hat became fashionable not only in the us but also among the english haberdashery and european royalty really youd have the best luck ordering a highquality hat over the internet from a reputable importer though panama does its own version called the sombrero pintado in the penonomé region youll find a range of hats at the stands at plaza cinco de mayo as well as a limited selection at the ymca handicrafts market in balboa jewelry during the centuries before the arrival of the spanish indigenous groups produced decorative gold pieces called huacas which they laid to rest with the dead to protect their souls in the afterlife the word comes from the incas meaning something that is revered such as an ancestor or a god spurred by the theft of huacas from the national anthropology museum an american living in panama during the s set up reprosa which makes elaborate and stunning jewelry casts using the lost wax process of the ancient indigenous groups if youre searching for a oneofakind luxury gift for someone special come here reprosa has several more demure collections that include orchids treasures

isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to

núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred

tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular

núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred

tribes these people have nearly disappeared as they had no immunity from european infectious diseases precolumbian periodedit amphibian pendant walters art museum embera girl dressed for a dance the isthmus of panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities the earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in panama include paleoindian projectile points later central panama was home to some of the first potterymaking in the americas for example the cultures at monagrillo which date back to – bc these evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials dating to c – ad at the monagrillo archaeological site and their beautiful gran coclé style polychrome pottery the monumental monolithic sculptures at the barriles chiriqui site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures before europeans arrived panama was widely settled by chibchan chocoan and cueva peoples the largest group were the cueva whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain estimates range as high as two million people but more recent studies place that number closer to  archaeological finds and testimonials by early european explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developedclarification needed by regular

núñez de balboas tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in  demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas and panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of spains empire in the new world gold and silver were brought by ship from south america hauled across the isthmus and loaded aboard ships for spain the route became known as the camino real or royal road although it was more commonly known as camino de cruces road of crosses because of the number of gravesites along the way panama was under spanish rule for almost  years – and became part of the viceroyalty of peru along with all other spanish possessions in south america from the outset panamanian identity was based on a sense of geographic destiny and panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus the colonial experience also spawned panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalismcitation needed in  the real audiencia de panama was established initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn before the conquest of peru a real audiencia royal audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court each audiencia had an oidor spanish hearer a judge spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of panama large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era because of this indigenous people of the area were often referred to as indios de guerra war indians and resisted spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them however panama was enormously important to spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe silver cargoes were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobello or nombre de dios on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment because of the incomplete spanish control the panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates mostly dutch and english and from new world africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the camino real in panamas interior and on some of the islands off panamas pacific coast one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano which emerged in the  to  sir francis drakes famous raids on panama in – and john oxenhams crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarrons and spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in  the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries – while contributing to colonial growth the placing of extensive regional judicial authority real audiencia as part of its jurisdiction and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colonies the end of the encomienda system in azuero however sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year under the leadership of francisco vázquez the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in  in the newly conquered region the old system of encomienda was imposed on the other hand the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula set forth by the spanish crown in  because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population in its stead a system of medium and smallersized landownership was promoted thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and smallsized proprietors panama was the site of the illfated darien scheme which set up a scottish colony in the region in  this failed for a number of reasons and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of england and scotland in  in  the privateer henry morgan licensed by the english government sacked and burned the city of panama – the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time in  the viceroyalty of new granada northern south america was created in response to other europeans trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region the isthmus of panama was placed under its jurisdiction however the remoteness of new granadas capital santa fe de bogotá the modern capital of colombia proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated as the authority of new granada was contested by the seniority closer proximity and previous ties to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panamas own initiative this uneasy relationship between panama and bogotá would persist for centuries in  bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june   founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier by this time however panamas importance and influence had become insignificant as spains power dwindled in europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific while the panama route was short it was also laborintensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and ladendown trek required to get from the one coast to the other during the last half of the th century and the first half of the th century migrations to the countryside decreased panama citys population and the isthmus economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sectorcitation needed sedit santo domingo church as the spanish american wars of independence were heating up all across latin america panama city was preparing for independence however their plans were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos cry from the town of saints issued on november   by the residents of azuero without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire in both veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain although on differing levels to veraguas it was the ultimate act of treason while to the capital it was seen as inefficient and irregular and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans nevertheless the grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core it was a sign on the part of the residents of azuero of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt since the separatists in panama city believed that their counterparts in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain but also for their right to selfrule apart from panama city once the spaniards were gone it was an incredibly brave move on the part of azuero which lived in fear of colonel josé pedro antonio de fábrega y de las cuevas – and with good reason the colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus military supplies in his hands they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists what they had counted on however was the influence of the separatists in the capital ever since october  when the former governor general juan de la cruz murgeón left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left the veraguan colonel in charge the separatists had been slowly converting fábrega to the separatist side so by november  fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement soon after the separatist declaration of los santos fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the citys support for independence no military repercussions occurred

view  photos of panama the world factbook × central america and caribbean panama    caption twenty million years ago ocean covered the area where panama is today there was a gap between the continents of north and south america through which the waters of the atlantic and pacific oceans flowed freely over time tectonic forces pushed up the sea floor eventually forcing some areas above sea level by about  million years ago an isthmus had formed between north and south america an isthmus is a narrow strip of land with water on either side that connects two larger bodies of land scientists believe the formation of the isthmus of panama is one of the most important geologic events to happen on earth in the last  million years even though it is only a tiny sliver of land relative to the sizes of continents the isthmus of panama had an enormous impact on earths climate and its environment by shutting down the flow of water between the two oceans the land bridge rerouted currents in both the atlantic and pacific oceans atlantic currents were forced northward and eventually settled into a new current pattern that we call the gulf stream today with warm caribbean waters flowing toward the northeast atlantic the climate of northwestern europe grew warmer winters there would be as much as  degrees c colder in winter without the transport of heat from the gulf stream the atlantic no longer mingling with the pacific also grew saltier each of these changes helped establish the global ocean circulation pattern we see today in short the isthmus of panama directly and indirectly influenced ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns which regulated patterns of rainfall which in turn sculpted landscapesthis falsecolor image of panama was made using data acquired in february  by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm flying aboard the space shuttle endeavor highquality satellite imagery of central america is generally difficult to obtain due to persistent cloud cover in

allowing for the construction of a canal and us sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure the panama canal zone the panama canal was built by the us army corps of engineers between  and  in  an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the canal from the us to panama by the end of the century certain portions of the zone and increasing responsibility over the canal were turned over in the subsequent decades with us help dictator manuel noriega was deposed in  the entire panama canal the area supporting the canal and remaining us military bases were transferred to panama by the end of  an ambitious expansion project to more than double the canals capacity  by allowing for more canal transits and larger ships  was carried out between  and

contrasts it is in the midst of a demographic transition characterized by steadily declining rates of fertility mortality and population growth but disparities persist based on wealth geography and ethnicity panama has one of the fastest growing economies in latin america and dedicates substantial funding to social programs yet poverty and inequality remain prevalent the indigenous population accounts for a growing share of panamas poor and extreme poor while the nonindigenous rural poor have been more successful at rising out of poverty through ruraltourban labor migration the governments large expenditures on untargeted indirect subsidies for water electricity and fuel have been ineffective but its conditional cash transfer program has shown some promise in helping to decrease extreme poverty among the indigenous population panama has expanded access to education and clean water but the availability of sanitation and to a lesser extent electricity remains poor the increase in secondary schooling  led by female enrollment  is spreading to rural and indigenous areas which probably will help to alleviate poverty if educational quality and the availability of skilled jobs improve inadequate access to sanitation contributes to a high incidence of diarrhea in panamas children which is one of the main causes of panamas elevated chronic malnutrition rate especially among

periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
