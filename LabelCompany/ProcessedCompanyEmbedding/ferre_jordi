discussed in the forwardlooking statements some of these risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the company’s filings with the sec in addition during the course of this call we will be presenting quarterly results under the assumption that agrofresh has been operating as an independent public company in the first seven months of  which you will see in the tables in the press release and in the q being referred to as part of the predecessor period because agrofresh was not an independent company in the predecessor period amounts pertaining to the predecessor period are not comparable to the first seven months of  referred to as part of the successor period when agrofresh was operating as an independent company in such instances we will provide a comparative context to assist with the analysis of yearoveryear results we’ll also refer to certain nongaap financial measures please refer to the table’s attached to the slides that accompany this presentation which can be found in the investor relations section of our website for reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures i would now like to turn the call over to steve trevor our member of the agrofresh board of directors and former coacting chief executive officer stephen trevor thank you and good morning everyone i’m joined today by our new leadership team jordi ferre our chief executive officer and kathy harper our chief financial officer nance dicciani and i have been impressed by the immediate impact both have made on the organization in one short month and look forward as board members to supporting both of them as they help agrofresh to realize its full potential over the last seven months nance and i approached our job as interim coceos with a sense of urgency and a great deal of change has been instituted in the organization to begin the necessary work to meet our commitment to growth if you refer slide  we’ve done well on a number of fronts but in the face of increased competition for our flagship product we needed to make a strategic balancing decision first to ensure pricing that reflected our leadership position while acknowledging a competitive dynamic and second to maintain market share and customer relationships for the longterm as we expand our offerings to our significant customer base nance and i wanted to take the responsibility to address these issues specifically as these choices were made on our watch as we announced this morning our estimation is now that we will not be able to make a prior fullyear guidance for either revenue or adjusted ebitda the principal reasons for this are shown on slide  first when we reported our firsthalf results despite the smaller than expected apple crop harvest in the southern hemisphere we remain confident about our fullyear guidance because all external sources pointed to a significantly larger harvest in the all important us market however while the us apple harvest this year appears to be up versus the harvest in  it is now projected to be a  increase versus the previously forecasted gain of a  second as i just mentioned we experienced greater than anticipated competitive pricing pressure and decided to adjust price in order to maintain our market leadership and customer relationships for the longerterm all while still commanding a premium price on the positive side as we expected we maintained our 0plus share of the market for treated apples with our highest share position still in the us third we fell short of our original projections on the adoption of harvista although we have seen  growth in harvista applications this year treating about 0 acres in the first nine months of  this fall short of our expectations to treat 0 acres we’ve gained significant experience with the product this year in terms of how and when it works best how it is valued by customers and what varieties of apples and pears it is optimized and we continue to believe harvista will grow as a percentage of our revenue mix turning to slide  as i mentioned the us crop is forecasted to be up  at the time of our last earnings call ever since then expectations for the us harvest have dropped to yearoveryear growth of just  while the european crop outlook has remained consistent with previous forecasts in summary we now anticipate that fullyear revenue will be between 0 million and  million and  adjusted ebitda will be between  million and  million this is certainly not the situation we want to hand over to new management that said jordi and kathy have taken these challenges on with new thinking and dynamic leadership nance and i are confident that they can lead the organization through these shortterm competitive challenges and make the necessary corrections to achieve our longerterm growth objectives i’ll turn the call over to them now to talk about these growth challenges as well as more specifics on the third quarter most important they’re taking on the leadership of the company that is far stronger than it was at this point a year ago and one where the groundwork has been laid for longterm success even in the face of shortterm issues i’d now like to introduce jordi ferre the new ceo of agrofresh jordi ferre thank you steve and good morning i’m delighted to be here with you as a new ceo of agrofresh even as we face some immediate challenges to the business i see untapped opportunities to generate new revenue sources and accelerate our product diversification please turn to slide  kathy will provide a detailed walk through of our third quarter results but let me provide you with a highlevel summary revenue for the third quarter was  million roughly flat versus the third of  revenue of  million as steve said we took proactive steps to defend our leading position in the face of increased competition and protect this business for the longerterm while we adjusted our price in the us we believe that we were able to continue to command a premium price due to our superior value proposition as a leading solutions provider in the postharvest space from adjusted ebitda perspective we were down versus the third quarter of  kathy will provide more details on ebitda in her section as steve has just explained in  we have seen an increase in competitive activity that affected the pricing dynamics for smartfresh stepping back from the decision made this year it’s clear that the agrofresh organization has operated largely in a world with limited competition we now need to adapt quickly to the new reality the smarter and more aggressive competitive strategies let me explain on this concept as shown on slide  my initial assessment is that as market leaders we need to reinforce our gotomarket strategy by increasing our service platform that is the breadth of the offerings we have in our toolkit and bring more value to our customers that bills off the smartfresh franchise services are already underway to conduct an advanced customer segmentation and find new ways to tailor our offerings in order to best meet the needs of each segment of customs having been at the company for five weeks now i’m encouraged by many of the things i see at agrofresh we have untapped value in several forms first we have industryleading knowledge technical expertise and knowhow of plant physiology that we are not converting into revenue streams todate we have over  granted patents and 0 pending patent applications globally a significant part of our workforce is employed in research and development activities and rd spending is  of our revenue a ratio that is double the average for companies in the us we have over  active product registrations for different crops in different geographies and although many are in use todate over 0 of our revenue is still derived from one crop i have challenged the team to immediately identify opportunities to expand our revenue base in ways that can contribute meaningfully and quickly to earnings growth second we have not fully leveraged our relationship network with over  customers worldwide in terms of our ability to provide them with a broader array of products and services and this customers are not distributors or agents but end customers with whom we maintain a direct relationship and from whom we derive over 0 of our revenue we operate a sophisticated service model with a truly global reach selling directly in over 0 countries we can do better than just offer them one or two product choices and we’re actively scoring for those opportunities with our customers input third i could see immediately that we should be pursuing opportunities to partner with other parties which would allow us to tap our technical and commercial value faster and diversify quickly into different applications and products and finally we intend to work on optimizing our cost base during 0 we will work towards streamlining the company’s cost structure focusing our spending on initiatives that we believe will produce the best return for the organization growth and innovations will be our guiding principles but we still believe we can do this in a much more efficient way turning to slide  i’m taking the lead on this personally and i see three immediate routes for us to pursue the first is commercial and distribution agreements we’re identifying a list of potential target products and services in the postharvest space where we can add value by providing a direct customer reach and technical expertise this makes agrofresh appealing to manufacturers as they prefer gotomarket route the second is rd development agreements we can develop new and meaningful technologies who partnerships to coin this bring to commercial scale and pick to market more quickly and more broadly now we are currently doing on our own the third is commercial partnerships into new channels we have already begun the process to identify and discuss with various potential partners about leveraging our technology into other channels including preharvest but also distribution retail and even consumer channels turning to slide  now that i have outlined our plan for the future i will provide an update about the progress this year to diversify our business let me first highlight that we plan to start reporting base business defined as smartfresh postharvest sales into the global apple market excluding asia and pipeline opportunities which include providing product offerings to other crops outside the core apple market growth in our existing product portfolio other than smartfresh including harvista landspring and ripelock and the development of new products and services and delivery methods that allow us to increase our presence throughout the value chain apples are very important but other crops make up  of our business today with pears being the next largest contributor at  while diversification into new products and crops is important protecting our base is equally important it is this strong base from which we will build our diversification strategy we will provide you more context on this and how it pertains to 0 at a later date please turn to slide  i will address our base business performance again we define base business as smartfresh sales into the global apple crop excluding asia the performance metrics shown in this slide include external factors size of crop and size of crop being stored as well as percentage penetration of mcp postharvest treatments over total crop and estimated share of our smartfresh product in  we project another share loss which will be partially offset by an increasing penetration of global apple crop treated with mcp turning to slide  beyond our smartfresh base business the company’s fastestgrowing product offering is harvista which was launched in 0 as our first foray into the preharvest segment this is a product that we believe provides benefits in quality and yield that will transform the market thus providing meaningful growth opportunities both in apples as well as other crops this season we treated 0 acres with harvista a  increase over  we had a goal of treating up to 0 acres but after a strong start in argentina in the firsthalf of the year our penetration in north america was below expectations additionally shortfalls in harvista sales in turkey were the result of uncertainty associated with political unrest that occurred during the start of the apple season we continue to see growth in harvista moving forward and we will seek to accelerate that growth please turn to slide  we are also very excited about our other new product offerings ripelock continues to perform well in various tests we’re conducting in collaboration with retailers in the us and europe landspring has achieved its first commercial sales in the fourth quarter although small advanstore is to become part of the smartfresh quality system we treated about  rooms this year and see this product is an important differentiator for us we expect this products to make meaningful contributions to revenue growth but the timeframe will be longer given the regulatory approval processes require to expand our current geographic scope this product also represent important steps to diversify our crop base into some of the largest markets and highvalue fruits worldwide please turn to slide  i would like to finish with our growth metrics that summarizes our business model we are targeting to become the global leader in the food quality preservation and waste reduction space this includes providing proprietary quality systems that include advanced technologies such as smartfresh or harvista supported with datadriven solutions our mission is to enable every step of the supply chain to maximize the percentage of products supplied to the market relative to the amount of products grown as well as increase consumer appeal of products on retail every one of our current and future offerings addresses the specific products and supply chain segment which business opportunity will be properly quantified with that i’d like to turn the call over to kathy for a more robust discussion of our financial results katherine harper thank you jordi and good morning i feel very excited to be here and look forward to working with jordi and all of you to bring transparency and clarity to agrofresh’s result please turn to slide  i’ll first walk you through the third quarter financial results then provide some comments on the balance sheet and cash flow as steve mentioned revenue for the third quarter of  was flat versus the prior year third quarter smartfresh gains in asia and emea region in addition to harvista growth in north america were offset by smartfresh declines in north america the impact of currency on sales was negligible in the third quarter of  versus the same period in  our largest exposure is to the euro operating gross profit as a percentage of sales was  in the third quarter of  compared to  in the third quarter of  the decline was driven by the mix impact of harvista and lower average smartfresh prices in the us agrofresh posted net income of  million and ebitda of  million for the third quarter  flat as compared to last year’s third quarter’s ebitda free cash flow was used in the quarter of  million with seasonal increases in working capital on a yeartodate date basis free cash flow improved  million over the first nine months of  i have more detail on that in a subsequent slide moving to slide  i have a few comments on operating costs rd expenses were flat in the third quarter of  versus the third quarter of  as ga expenses were up slightly in the quarter versus  increased severance and litigationrelated expenses were offset by lower consulting costs we still expect our sga costs to be in the range of approximately  per quarter starting in 0 on slide  here you will find a bridge between gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda jordi and i view ebitda as the key measure to evaluate our earnings performance previously agrofresh used adjusted ebitda as our key earnings measure consistent with the definition of consolidated ebitda in our credit agreement we believe the change to ebitda will prove the transparency of the business increase the comparability of our results and focus the agrofresh team on improving the results i’m committed to continually improving transparency of our financial results for investors please note we appreciate that changing isn’t always easy we included a slide in the deck and a table at the end of the press release that walks through the reconciliation of gaap to nongaap measures we also intend to furnish this information when we do our fourth quarter call as well as furnish the same level of transparency for prior quarters shortly after this call beginning with net income in the third quarter of  we add back income taxes inventory stepup amortization depreciation and amortization and interest expense to arrive at an ebitda of  million for the quarter which is slightly higher than the third quarter of  of  million the increase was driven by noncash accounting gains in the current year quarter and charges in the prior year quarter mostly offset by impact of lower operating gross margin the comment on interest expense you may recall the borrowing that was put in place at the end of july of  so for  there are three months of interest expense in our third quarter results versus just two months of interest expense in the third quarter of  the balance of the reconciliation details the adjustments allowed by the credit agreement including nonrecurring charges marktomarket adjustments severance and gain loss on currency please turn to slide  for a discussion of free cash flow here we will walk from ebitda to free cash flow similar to ebitda we are also changing to a more traditional free cash flow methodology the cash flow slide shows both the quarter and the nine months ended september 0  given the seasonality of the business let’s look at the yeartodate cash flow results starting with the ebitda of  million for the nine months ended september 0 we add back noncash stockbased compensation charges of  million we paid  million of cash interest on our credit facility yeartodate in  interest expense on the profit and loss statement was  million in the first nine months of  the difference between income statement and cash interest expense relates primarily to accretion on the fair value of contingent considerations of the dow which are recorded in liabilities we paid  million in cash taxes for certain us state and foreign jurisdictions in the first nine months of  we had a net increase in working capital and other of  million yeartodate in  driven by higher prepaid expenses of  million associated with recoverable of that payment and higher accounts receivable of  million resulting from the seasonality of the business receivables typically grown throughout the secondhalf of each year as we’ve historically recognized approximately 0 to  of our annual revenue associated within the northern hemisphere crop accounts receivable then traditionally decreased about the firsthalf of the following year as well as northern hemisphere receivables are collected additionally prepaid a component of other current assets grow as we accumulate that billings that are recoverable in the coming quarters working capital and other improved substantially versus the nine months ended september 0  in  the company added significant assets and liabilities related to taxes that were not on the balance sheet one of the business unit of dow we had capital expenditures of  million in the first nine months of  with more than  million invested in harvest disbursed that facilitated the growth we saw in this product thus free cash flow was a use of  million in the first nine months of  a  million improvement over  turning to slide  cash flow is truly the hallmark of agrofresh with high margins and an assetlight business model this company can expect to generate significant free cash flow each year while some of that cash will be used in our early years as we build out the business you can expect that we will prudently put this cash to work to fund our rd provide returns to investors and continue to evaluate accretive business development opportunities turning to the balance sheet we closed the period with liquidity of 0 million and nearly  million of cash on hand our debt maturity profile reflects the fact that the term loan doesn’t mature until  and only requires  annual principal repayment this is a moment of transition for agrofresh as jordi and i step in we’re committed to delivering on the great potential agrofresh has to unlock and we hope some of the changes you’ve seen today demonstrate our commitment to transparency and clarity in the agrofresh results i’d now like to turn the call back over to jordi for a discussion of our strategic priorities and some closing thoughts before we begin the qa jordi ferre thanks kathy although there are shortterm challenges that we will need to navigate this company has many strengths and on top of the potential including industryleading knowledge technical expertise and knowhow of plant physiology our relationship network with over  direct customers worldwide sophisticated service model with a truly global reach selling directly in over  countries we will use these strengths to capitalize on growth opportunities diversify our revenue with new products crops and geographies rd are taking a more commercially driven approach partnerships and ma need to be accretive in the short run we’re on our way to becoming the company we set out to be but there will be a lot of hard work required before we get there i’d like to thank steve and nance for their stewardship of the organization prior to my joining and look forward to working with them on the board in closing kathy and i couldn’t be more excited to be here and look forward to this journey with all of you with that i will turn the call over to the operator to begin the qa questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of daniel jester with citi please proceed with your question daniel jester hi good morning everyone so previously there had been a goal that new products like harvista way cumulatively had about  million of revenue over the coming five years having stepped in jordi and look at the company can you just give us your initial thoughts about how achievable growth is from some of these new products and any sort of initial expectations for how you’re thinking about growing that away from the base business jordi ferre yes thank you for the question the first thing i’d like to say is clearly as my five weeks here i can tell you that the potential is there so those numbers were build the potential is there what we have to see is how we’re going to get there and i think if you’ve seen through my presentation the message i try to convey is we will take the strategies and make the decisions that are going to best get to that growth so when i lay out potential partnerships or other ways to gotomarket the only goal for that is to actually get to that growth so as i’m sitting here the potential is there i will always – we will be updating more about all the progress we are making towards that but the potential is definitely there so it’s going to be up to me and the new management team on how to really get those things pass that into it so yes my general answer is positive on that sense daniel jester okay thank you and then for harvista in the us specifically is there are any color that you can provide with regards to why it penetrated slower than you had expected and as you talk to your us customers how are they thinking about their cost structure i know that labor cost has been an issue in the past and it seems like labor costs could be an issue in the future so i’m just wondering what you’re hearing from them about those two topics as well jordi ferre okay so thanks for that question as well i think the first part of your question was about harvista i think as we see we missed the projection that we have but we actually still grew  and when you grow  definitely is value there in that product where we missed it was there was a particular variety of apples where we believe that we will learn a lot this year and we have to adjust the value proposition into next year so i think that generally speaking the message on harvista is going to be positive in the sense that where the outlook is because as i said we will learn about some of the adjustments we need to make and we will those adjustments and i’m going to be very personally involved in those so that’s number one number two on the second part of it i cannot comment too much i have – actually have initial discussions with customers on this particular case and about the labor costs it’s going to be one that i’m going to get into it but i can’t really comment specifically at this point daniel jester okay and then one last one from me and then i’ll jump back in the queue with regards to smartfresh your encapsulation patent in the us expires in  so given the pricing competition that you saw this year how should we be thinking about the potential opportunities and risks that presents over the next couple of years thanks jordi ferre obviously i’m not going to be naive here and i want to say that competition we see competition obviously increasing today and in the future as well but i think that what we need to do is be much a lot more competitive what we do we have to think a different approach on how we actually go about our offering our knowledge our service levels is on parallel nobody can even get close to what we do which is nice to say what we need to make sure is that we actually are able to actually extract that value moving forward and you know there is a difference that approach here that we’re going to take and that approach is going to be about reinforcing our service model we will be focusing more on overall quality systems rather than focusing on the individual solutions that would include also adding other solutions that may not be a focus today but they could be out there and i think that we can add that in terms of becoming a more complete service provider we also think that we can – also thinking about customers offer some agreements ahead of the harvest season which i think that are going to be meant to share some of the risk that can come associated with the crop and the actual back out of apples and third it will always be those customers that may just not appreciate the level of service and that’s fine we will not provide service we will just provide a very low price or more adjusted price offering i also want to say though that although you mentioned about the patent expiration let’s not kid ourselves we already have based on competition in some markets so we are not completely coming out of this with low competition but as i said you have to be a lot more smarter you have to change the approach and i’m personally going to be taking the lead of this i’m going to be driving this very personally daniel jester okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian nolan with jpmorgan please proceed with your question brian nolan hi guys i got a couple of questions i can hop back in line if i get too longwinded first of all i’m interested in about your guidance update you guys had an investor presentation post the apple conference – the apple marketing conference and that was when the information came out that the us apple crop is only going to be plus  but you just change your estimates now so i was wondering as to the timing of that can you explain that jordi ferre i will pass that question over to steven stephen trevor sure so let me just share you a little bit about sort of the timing of our business and the timing of the harvest so hopefully we’ll give you a little clarity on that and as you probably know our harvest actually began in the northern hemisphere in august and it goes through november and so one of the things we’ve been doing is aggregating thirdparty information to try to provide the best data series that we can understand if there’s no public information about some of the end market that we serve and in addition what we do of course is we talk regularly to customers so in the middle part of september we were actually out receiving some updates in terms of a thirdparty crop estimates but also hearing from customers at that time essentially our customers were telling us that the crop was bigger than some of the data is here and so as we kind of came into the month of september and october we had customers who had reviewed overall we had some data and we’re watching it all very closely as we sit here in november towards the end of the harvest it’s clear to us that the earlier more optimistic view of the goal that we intend to deal with these things it ranges advance and our ability was that – at this point we have to come to the conclusion that crop in order comes into your perspective is lower than we were brian nolan okay thank you and can you breakout harvista as a percentage of revenues for this year and last year stephen trevor yes i mean– so let me see if i can help a little bit with that so harvista is a product we said it’s somewhere between  and  of our sales on a consolidated basis and so despite our harvista sales being bit lower we’re still in that range for calendar  and as jordi highlighted this is a product that we will still at the beginning of its growth curve it’s growing nicely this year so we will continue to work at band as we unfold but we expect it to be a bigger percentage of sales in years ahead brian nolan okay and just two more quick questions i think first of all trupick it doesn’t sound like it was even registered for this harvest season in the united states so why did you take a kind of preemptive decision to cut pricing jordi ferre steve i think i would like some… stephen trevor so let me just talk a little bit in kind of a competitive framework because you’re asking about trupick that we probably also should talk about the pieces of technology so – and there are different competitive frameworks that we operated in around the world and so again just to remind you historically more than a quarter of our business never had any patent protection in some of those markets we have existing competitors so argentina would be an example of that that we’ve shared with you in the past where we had competition we saw the leading market share we saw very attractive margins but just the competition is not new to us and the fact that we have pace of the potential competitor here something we’ve also been working on for last several years they essentially created a new delivery mechanism that does something similar not the same to what we do and they have been working with our customer base and so far have been some share but that sort of singledigit amounts of total share so they’re an important competitor but somebody you hasn’t really gained significant share of the market as of now the specific question you asked though was about a new competitor in the form of a company called the dow ph they’ve announced a new product that product will be in the market at this point and so it’s too easy to say what their particular impact on the market is more of a 0 brian nolan okay one final question before i hop in the queue i guess you guys mentioned in the investor presentation that there’s no financial maintenance covenants on the term loan is that an amended situation because i think i remember from the original credit agreement that there was a  times senior secured leverage ratio on the term loan am i mistaken katherine harper that’s on the revolver not on the… brian nolan that’s on the revolver okay understood all right thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brent rystrom with feltl and company please proceed with your question brent rystrom yes thank you just based on your comments earlier how do we think about pricing for harvista next year jordi ferre well on harvista itself we do not see any major variation at all on harvista pricing that’s the way we’ll look at it brent rystrom all right and then constructively at this point how would you think about growth next year is the  an aberration and you expect faster growth as you get better really in that product out or is there a similar growth rate next year how do you think harvista will grow next year jordi ferre i think we will at least getting that having the same type of growth we have seen this year at least brent rystrom and then any updates on the thought and i apologize i haven’t looked at this in the few weeks but on the twoyear ebitda performance kind of bonus to dow have you guys updated your thoughts on that jordi ferre i think i would prefer that steve takes on that question stephen trevor so let me just again kind of share a little bit of context so as part of the initial transaction there was an opportunity for dow to get paid an additional  million if the business hit several years of an ebitda target and we – those two years are calendar  and 0 respectively so it’s too soon for us to say anything definitive in terms of whether the company will or won’t be in a position to make any further payments to dow on that metric we’re – for  we’re definitely below where that metric would – we need to believe that that’s going to happen but it’s just a  issue and it’s too soon to be commenting about ga any specific manner brent rystrom and then just final quick question jordi you had mentioned the new markets possibly new products joint venture or what have you yes are there a couple of spaces that you would target when you look outside of apples outside of pears looking at what you guys have announced with your entry into the great market in a few years where would be the couple of places that your placing your greatest hope as far as growth opportunities in other products jordi ferre yes i understand your question is about crops or not necessarily crops but i think in crops we do see obviously there’s still potential within apples but we do see that in grapes we do see that in other actually products like mangos we do see that in other places where we will actually force our southern hemisphere and i think that we will actually be going further on to a number of things that i can’t talk at this point in time but we also have a number of work that we’ve done in the past that i’m going to make sure that that actually gets into the market through the best route to actually giving the opportunity in other words other than the other fruits bananas apples pears mangos et cetera that we see an opportunity in grapes there is opportunities as well that we see in other crops additionally let’s not forget and that’s what i put the growth metrics there’s not always the growth potentially in terms of crops there’s also the growth potentially into different parts of the supply chain we have a product at landspring that actually goes into the nursery and grow aside on average like tomatoes we also have ripelock which actually goes to the end of the supply chain towards the consumer and retailer that’s actually todate in bananas but could be expanded so again we will talk about crops no doubt but we also will talk about different areas of the supply chain which we will need to provide the right solutions and that’s where i tied into my comment of our partnerships and distributions i’m not necessarily married and fighting togoto market to my standard way to gotomarket i will find the best way to gotomarket and make sure that these technologies and products i give an opportunity earlier faster and more efficient brent rystrom thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian nolan with jpmorgan please proceed with your question brian nolan chase  co hi guys so just a couple of followup questions one of the things that we’ve never really gone much color on previously is where some of your geographical breakout is for revenue in europe can you talk about where your biggest markets are there where your biggest sales exposure is jordi ferre i think if i may say because our sales are more dependent today on apples and by the way our index on pears is quite large in europe i would say that obviously logically our largest markets are those that have the largest reduction of apples and pears there’s no secret our largest market in europe is italy and then we have a number of markets that are quite well distributed in terms of the way they have include france spain netherlands germany and then we have other markets obviously like turkey and poland that are also added there so i would say that italy is definitely our main market today but the rest of the markets are quite spread there’s not one market that’s greater and not bumping on the rest it’s quite well spread into another markets that we sell brian nolan okay and i saw one of the updates in terms of geographies is it looks like you’re making a more concerted push into china now is there a reason that – it’s seems like they’re the largest apple market in the world is there a reason that this is a growth market for you now and not a focus historically jordi ferre i think that china is definitely – if you look at statistics is the largest market in the world for apple production no doubt about it now having said that they’re also an evolving market so it’s a market that you do not have the same structure that you have in europe today or you have in the us in terms of more organized better more sophisticated supply chain so you have a lot of smallholders and you have a myriad and network of agents that makes it different that what’s happened in the other countries so why we have to put china has a place to grow them by the way we are investing in that market so for two reasons one is we cannot ignore the number one producer of apples in the world that’s number one it’s very simple number two china continues to evolve i have personally experienced in that market that a lot of the things you say about china today may not be true in two three years i mean i was in the different market where people say that chinese will not be interested in calling sugar they did and they are more and more and i think in this market it is going to happen the same you will see a reorganization in change in terms of the distribution challenge in china all the apples and all the actual whole supply chain is going to go we have to be there we have to be there with specific chinese strategists it might not really show a very strong growth in the shortterm but we will definitely have that as you know pipeline for capitalizing in the next years how to actually get to that market i’m not going to give up the china that i cannot do it as ceo of this company will be at the service brian nolan okay understood thank you and two more quick questions the – there was a lawsuit filed against trupick are you able to speak about that or is that still… jordi ferre we’re not in a position to talk about pending litigation we only will say that we are very very confident that our ip position is very strong brian nolan okay and final question have you guys released any information regarding some of the financial implications of the jvs with whether it’s botanocap or whoever else have you discussed how that’s going to impact your financials jordi ferre so we haven’t actually disclosed it obviously brian nolan okay stephen trevor so what we said is that add to that a little bit is as these products are still some of them in testing and as we have both revenue and customers frameworks that we’ll be sharing details with you but they’ll be kind of a cascade if you look at the chart that jordi described products that we’ve introduced there’s some products that we’re just explaining there’s a new end market that we’re entering to some products with our business arena revenue base and we’re describing the curve of the revenue and ebitda and so you should expect that to be a continuous process from us as new products go to our network jordi ferre yes building on what just steve said you saw that i made a lot of emphasis about being very clear and how we report base business and pipeline and i intend to do that more and more on these calls with investors because i think you need to understand what is the dynamic for the base business what is the dynamic on those pipeline that we’re building and always pipeline projects that we have will impact over time and i think this is something that we always to our investor community but you also worry to ourselves so we will be a lot more granular about these opportunities that we move forward that’s the reason why i lay out the way we’re going to report in terms of based in pipeline brian nolan okay and one last thing i know for competitive reasons you may not be able to but can you talk about the magnitude of the price cut as it impact sales jordi ferre steve you want to take that and set what’s in there stephen trevor yes so i think it’s worth spending just a moment kind of sharing with you what our pricing framework looks like for customers because we have  customers as jordi described we have customers who prefer to get services from us in a reasonably wide range of formats so there are some customers for example who like the flexibility of being to have us come with one increment ph of the exact moment that they ask for we have some customers who wants to run the entire season and they can fill and refill the warehouse and get mobile applications and so when it comes to describing our pricing framework to you and obviously we’re not going to – customer – comment on any one customer’s information with respect to our customers but we – as a result we have a reasonably complex range of alternatives that are the way that our customers like to buy from us and so at this point what i think we can say is we’ve given you that cascade it gives you a sense of kind of the magnitude of the pricing change this year and just to remind you smartfresh today is over 0 or in the area of 0 of our total business so that pricing impact was important as it relates our third quarter and we obviously care a lot about it but we’re talking about pricing impacts in terms of both preserving share maintaining the regulations of our customers that are not radical or dramatic in anyway brian nolan okay thank you operator thank you there no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks jordi ferre yes thank you so much everybody for attending this call what i would like to say is certainly this is not the way i would expect that the call will go in terms of – the first call for me in this company and for kathy we’ll talking about revising guidance certainly we’re facing some shortterm challenges we recognized but i would like everybody still to focus on the great strength that this company offers and i think that first of all i cannot strengthening of our knowhow of plant physiology our knowledge our technical expertise our relationship with  customers 0 of our sales are coming actually from these direct customers which is quite a big strength that the company has we’re truly a global company we actually sell to more than 0 countries i still think we have a solid organization some things may have to be changed but i don’t think that we have a very good people very well committed so my role here is going to be and kathy’s role as new management will be to actually make sure that all of these strengths that we have in the company is turning to growth the growth that everybody expected and still expect that we can deliver i just want to say one thing putting this company back to road is a very personal thing for me i did come in this company to actually because i did see a growing business and that’s how i see it so that’s how i want to say i will – working very hard to do that goal kathy will be along my side to reporting me and the whole team that i would face so i appreciate again you attending this morning this call

financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures i would now like to turn the call over to jordi ferre chief executive officer jordi ferre thank you and good morning everyone i’m joined today by kathy harper our chief financial officer let me start this morning by noting that we have had a strong first quarter with revenues up  from last year while we continue to make progress in reducing operating cost resulting in a significant improvement in profitability additionally our recent dow avenue agreements speak volumes about the confidence of two large shareholders having in our technology management and most importantly growth strategy let’s turn to slide  where we can review some of the highlight for the quarter in more detail revenue for the first quarter of 0 was  million up  over last year’s first quarter this is the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth versus a comparable period of the prior year primary attributable to the solid performance of our core postharvest business and our evolution from a single product to a quality system that includes other solutions such as advanstore and harvista we also saw strong growth in ethylbloc including increased demand in columbia where it is used to ensure the quality of flowers during a rainy season in addition ethylbloc has been adopted as part of a standard quality programs for potted orchids in the netherlands we also saw encouraging progress in our new business development segment where although from a still relatively low base both ripelock and landspring saw our sales grow this quarter compared to the same quarter last year we had another quarter of stable margins and further decreases in operating expenses this led to a significant improvement in ebitda and a reduction in our net loss while also generating  million of cash so that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of  million our performance continues to be driven by the strength of smartfresh where sales increased in latin america in the first quarter 0 despite a continued increase in competition especially in argentina overall pricing in the quarter was stable evidence of the strength of our basic value proposition that apple and other fruit growers overwhelmingly choose smartfresh when they need someone they can depend on to protect their investment harvista experienced doubledigit growth in argentina versus the first quarter of  ripelock revenues were also up versus the same quarter last year although from a low base we believe this is the indication of the potential of this product ripelock is a big part of our retail strategy and our trials for the large retailers in the us and uk are continuing to produce positive results we are working with retailers to roll out ripelock systemwide consequently we believe overall first quarter results reflect the health of our business and provide an early indication that our new strategy and enhanced financial discipline are helping to improve performance keep in mind as we discussed in our last call crop size can vary from year to year therefore we continue to expect some variability in our performance attributable to acute weather conditions that can have an impact on specific crops our strategy is to diversify the business to manage the challenges of weatherrelated crop impacts while these diversification efforts are beginning to take root they’ll need more time before helping us better manage our exposure please turn to slide  since joining agrofresh in october kathy and i have been working hard to implement changes we believe will unlock agrofresh growth potential we both came from competitive industries so competition is not new to us i have now visited all of the geographies in which we operate meeting with a wide range of customers and potential partners and engaging with our teams around the world in washington state latin america china to discuss implementation of our new commercial strategy this has provided me with a better appreciation of the outstanding professionals on our team our global infrastructure and our overall potential in the food waste prevention space and has strengthened my confidence in our strategy we continue to believe agrofresh has strong growth potential in the business of preserving and enhancing the quality and freshness of food reducing food waste and improving productivity we have developed a point plan to implement our strategy so let me provide you some updates on the progress being achieved across these broad initiatives please turn to slide  at the center of our strategy is our goal to strengthen the core postharvest business which is comprised of our smartfresh advanstore and existing harvistabased business strengthening our core is the key to establishing a solid foundation that will support the various growth initiatives and provide sufficient time and resources for them to develop and mature we are continuing to strengthen our smartfresh quality system with introduction of advanstore phase  a program that provides risk prediction utilizing microbial volatile organic compounds gas detection and genomic testing scaleup preparations are in progress for both north america and europe and we’ll be completing before the northern hemisphere selling season additionally in the second quarter we also expect to be introducing a new product to the smartfresh quality system platform to further differentiate and strengthen our competitive positioning in the appendix we have a slide showing the longterm trends in the global apple crop since crop size the proportion of apples actual stored and the degree of smartfresh penetration affect the core postharvest business although the crop performance can vary from year to year over the long term it tends to fall within a fairly predictable range the average of the ranges what we are using as a steadystate crop size as we believe over time it has shown to be fairly reliable relative to the steady rate scenario there were a few variations that impacted the first quarter revenue in latin america grew 0 from last year with a volume of apples treated in brazil up  generally speaking the 0 latin america harvest was also slightly earlier than last year in argentina we increased our penetration growing smartfresh and harvista volumes revenue in australia and new zealand was down  from last year as the australia 0 harvest season was approximately two weeks later than  we continue to work eventually on new registrations for the additional crops and in new geographies as a means to continue to expand our core smartfresh franchise to that end we have recently received approval for the use of smartfresh protabs in germany on apples as well as on pears plums and tomatoes consequently we are starting to have success expanding smartfresh to new crops for instance upwards of 0 of our first quarter revenue growth came from crops other than apples turning to slide  harvista and landspring continue to be our primary preharvest products harvista remains a key element of our smartfresh quality system for integrated apple growers and packers in addition harvista also has growth potential as a standalone product for such opportunities we believe it’s best to partner with companies that have the scale resources and specialized expertise needed to succeed in the preharvest market allowing us to concentrate our resources on strengthening our postharvest franchise as mentioned last quarter we recently entered into an agreement with red gold the recognized leader in the tomato industry based on the positive impact landspring had on their tomato yield in early april landspring secured epa approval for over  additional crops including broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage cantaloupe cauliflower cucumber eggplant bell peppers summer squash and watermelon this doubles landspring’s potential acreage additionally we are working with a number of potential preharvest partners to expand and diversify our one mcp preharvest technology in crops such as cotton melons and pineapples as seen on slide  we are also making great progress with our third initiative innovation our innovation strategy is focused on enhancing our food preservation and waste reduction technology solutions across the entire supply chain and so we have defined  different innovation platforms food fresheners and preservation detection systems software as a service and postharvest chemistry during the first quarter of 0 we have made two small investments for the purpose of gaining access to innovative technologies and in securing distribution rights consistent with our strategic focus on food freshness extension and waste reduction first we have made a small investment in an organic produced treatment that has the potential to dramatically extend the shelf life of fruits such as cherries and strawberries it also has antimicrobial properties our second investment was in the food sensor company which has a technology that is designed to provide realtime freshness reporting anywhere in the world for just a few cents per carton these are both earlystage innovating technologies and products in exciting areas off the postharvest space they also offer the opportunity to expand into new crops where one mcp is less effective especially highvalue fruits such as cherries and strawberries we are in an evaluation process with each of these companies and we’ll provide more details of these evaluations progress on slide  you will see the progress we have achieved with our fourth grow initiative expansion into retail retail is the largest growth opportunity for agrofresh food waste is an increasing global concern with  of these losses occurring from harvest to retail with our global footprint and proven food preservation technology we believe that agrofresh is ideally positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in retail ripelock is our first product entry in the retail market and it represents a substantial growth opportunity for our business though still small revenues continue to grow with positive customer trials to date showing that ripelock helps reduce shrinkage by as much as  to 0 as an example based on positive test results toni direito commercial director compagnie fruitiere a leading supplier of bananas in the uk said it is eyeopening to see how effective ripelock is we added ripelock to our program last year and immediately saw better quality and color in our bananas it has helped us manage our banana supply and our retailers and wholesalers like that the bananas have a longer shelf life the key to success will be to rollout the ripelock program in major retailers and with our  largest shareholders agreeing to provide up to 0 million in loans for approved acquisitions we have significantly expanded the range of candidates we could potentially acquire to reinforce our retail strategy now let me turn the call over to our cfo kathy harper to go through the financial results in greater detail kathy harper thank you jordi and good morning to everyone on the call let me review the first quarter financial highlights the new year’s off to a strong start with improved top and bottom line performance beginning with net sales please turn to slide  net sales for the first quarter of 0 were  million up  from a year ago sales of harvista and smartfresh and apples made up 0 of this growth with our largest contributions coming from brazil and chile as jordi noted over 0 of the growth in the quarter came from crops other than apple including pears flowers bananas and persimmon harvista for other crops also contributed meaningful growth as our business in argentina continues to expand the impact of currency on revenue was negligible in the first quarter of 0 compared to the first quarter of  operational gross margin of  was in line with the first quarter of  and was the result of a relatively stable pricing environment and some impact of higher revenue against the fairly consistent fixed cost base turning to slide  we are continuing to reduce operating expenses with selling general and administrative expenses down by over  million from a year ago quarter due to efficiency and productivity improvements there were a number of nonrecurring items such as litigation cost and expenses associated with our strategic review included in sga this quarter pricing us above our targeted run rate for the quarter that said we made progress during this quarter with our ongoing efforts to embed efficient and effective systems and processes and still expect to have average sga of  million per quarter in 0 research and development costs were  million which is  million less than the same quarter last year reflecting our efforts to more intently concentrate on products supporting our strategy over time we expect to achieve continued performance improvements in our business by further driving down operating expenses additionally interest expense decreased by nearly  million from a year ago to  million for the quarter this decrease was driven by lower noncash accretion expense on the contingent consideration otherwise known as the earnouts as a result of the adjustment to the value of contingent consideration recorded in the fourth quarter of  an additional adjustments arising out of our recently announced agreements with dow and avenue capital we expect interest cost to be reduced by  million per quarter compared to  on slide  you will see we generated ebitda of  million in the quarter which is a  million improvement over the  million in ebitda generated in the first quarter of  the company also continues to generate strong cash flow with cash flow from operations of  million in the quarter capital expenditures from  million in the first quarter up marginally from a year ago quarter for the full year we expect capital expenditures to be roughly  million with the majority of the increase versus  attributable to standingup our own independent it infrastructure and erp turning to slide  the balance sheet at march  0 was strong including significant liquidity debt was 0 million and cash was  million with total liquidity of 0 million in addition we now have access to up to 0 million in loans from dow and avenue for approved acquisition since the dow and avenue agreements were executed subsequent to the end of the first quarter we have included a couple of slides at the end of our presentation summarizing the deal and reflecting its impact on our balance sheet and statement of operations the net effect is that the agreements reduced liabilities by  million now i’ll turn the call back to jordi for a discussion of our outlook for 0 before opening the call to qa jordi ferre thank you kathy please turn to slide  the year is off to a good start and we are encouraged by the progress we achieved in the first quarter since our business is more heavily weighted towards the second half of the calendar year we are working diligently to ensure we sustain our success over the remainder of the year to that end we reconfirm our full year views provided during the fourth quarter conference call for gross profit margin we expect a slight decline in percentage similar to what we experienced in  driven mainly by product mix in terms of our balance sheet we are taking deliberate actions to improve our working capital in 0 from a cash flow perspective we expect to continue generating significant cash from operations we expect our ending cash balance in 0 to grow before the impact of any acquisitions or strategic investments summarizing in the first three months of 0 we continue to make progress in all of the areas that are key to our longterm success strengthening our business reducing unnecessary operating cost and implementing our growth strategy our agreements with dow and avenue improve our financial flexibility and give us access to additional resources to implement our growth strategy we are hard at work preparing for the balance of the year where we believe the development of our new marketing strategy and the smartfresh quality system will sharpen our competitive edge in the first quarter we gain key insights as to our new marketing strategy we are certain these insights will help improve our success in the upcoming northern hemisphere selling season we want to thank you for all your continued support now i would like to open the line to qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and the first question will come from daniel jester of citi please go ahead daniel jester so i thought i caught this in your prepared remarks but could you say that the latin america season was a bit early this year and i was just wondering if you can comment about some of the weather issues in argentina in the second quarter and just help us kind of bridge first quarter second quarter in terms of seasonality this year for revenues jordi ferre yes the crop you’re correct the crops that we saw especially in brazil was a little bit earlier this year concerning argentina i think i may have mentioned australia as potentially having some weather issues rather than argentina but as you saw that in first quarter we already were  we did not have stellar results in australia so that i would say that’s already accounted in the results on q daniel jester okay and then with regards to the ma dry powder which you referenced as part of the dow avenue transaction is there are there time restrictions in place and maybe you can just kind of update us on sort of what you’re seeing out there in the ma landscape kathy harper daniel the time restrictions you mean on the debt facility available to us we’ve got  it’s out there till ‘ daniel jester and then on sort of what’s the pipeline look like updates from the fourth quarter jordi ferre we obviously we have to be careful what we say but let me just put it this way we’ve been very active in building a strong pipeline of potential qa sorry of potential ma so you stay put for more news but we haven’t been just sitting on this we’ve been very actively working on this and there’s a number of discussions and actions that we’re doing right now and in near time we will be able to announce daniel jester okay and then as you’ve been meeting with customers can you give us any feedback on some of the changes you’re making in terms of how you go to market particularly in us and any initial thoughts about the pricing environment for the upcoming us season jordi ferre i think the  my observation is that customers have received very positively the fact that we are expanding our platform of services we have a good reputation our people are well liked and appreciated the service we do and the fact that we can actually extend it to other areas has been generally very well received in terms of the pricing environment i don’t think there’s any change of what i had already reported in the past we have already facing competition and about we estimate  of our revenue base and i don’t think there’s going to be a big change this year what’s going to change is the way we’re going to approach that by broadening our services and in the next quarter i’ll be able to announce a little bit more of what we are going to do especially in northern hemisphere in that respect daniel jester okay and then just a couple of quick ones maybe for kathy can you  what’s the bridge between the  million run rate you mentioned for sga and the  million that you reported in the first quarter kathy harper so in first quarter i did note that we had a few onetime items we had some significant litigation expense in the first quarter this year which was round numbers  million we did have some cost associated with strategic review and other valuations so it’s about  million and we had incentive cost we introduced a new longterm incentives plan that we booked some expense for and then  period to incentivize national research as well as fourth quarter of last year we were well below the  million and so just trying to give you a view we are at a target bonus accrual rate where in december fourth quarter of ‘ we actually for bonuses in  employees received  not 0 and so there was a credit in the fourth quarter and we’ve got a full 0 target in the first quarter so there is the chunk of the pieces operator operator instructions and the next question will come from brian nolan of jp morgan please go ahead brian nolan i wanted to ask you quickly can you give us some more information regards to where you’re seeing more sales outside of apples are you getting from  is it brazil watermelons and did that have carry overs into the north american season as well jordi ferre yes we see more sales in areas like pears kiwis and watermelons yes and obviously we also mentioned this situation we have very positively on flowers where we’re making progress as well with our solution brian nolan and also there’s something you mentioned during the call jordi that i didn’t quite pick up you had talked about gross margin expectations being similar to  is that correct or is there jordi ferre that is correct sorry yes i was  yes similar to  we’ve potentially supplied degradation because of the change of product mix operator the next question will come from michael indiscernible of bmo capital markets please go ahead unidentified analyst in terms of you mentioned  new competitors in argentina which it doesn’t look like they got much traction but can you give a little more color around who that is and exactly what’s going on down there jordi ferre i would prefer not to mention any of our competitors i would say that argentina has been an open market for a while we have faced some local competition and some of the more international companies have tried to get in but what i was mentioning i don’t know if had made that clear in the call is in spite of increased competition we actually increased market share so i thought i view that as very positive and i wanted to point it out during my call unidentified analyst yes no i agree obviously as i said obviously they’re not getting any traction against the increasing market share despite more competition is clearly very positive the other question i guess with kathy in terms of just is there sort of an adjusted ebitda number more similar to like sort for the bank term loan definition you can provide just so we can sort of track that against where we are in terms of covenants in previous quarters kathy harper no we told you last year we are shifting to the ebitda we manage the business by ebitda unidentified analyst okay i guess would something be posted on the syndtrak site ultimately for lenders then kathy harper yes operator the next question will be from eric gomberg of dane capital management please go ahead eric gomberg going back to the i guess then in the first question i just wanted to get if you can provide any more clarity regarding on a likeforlike basis shifting for seasonality in harvest what the growth looks like q this year versus q last year to the extent you could provide that jordi ferre that’s a little bit difficult to do because in summer events the like in latin america we saw that a little bit earlier while in australia and new zealand it was actually delayed but i would say that i am going to give you an approx number it’s fair to say that probably growth was  would have been between  to  so we still have i mean the fact that the crops in latin america was a little bit earlier would all take away from the fact that we actually seen growth in this first quarter eric gomberg that’s great that’s helpful and i assume the things that helped you grow on an organic kind of likeforlike basis in the southern hemisphere are things that ought to help in the northern hemisphere later this year all things being equal in terms of the crop size jordi ferre that’s correct eric gomberg okay and and then just one other question i just just looking through the deck it’s the way it reads to me it sounds like dow has not yet started buying back  of the stock but i wasn’t clear on that so i just wanted any color you can provide kathy harper so eric the easiest way to track that would be to look for dow filing operator the next question will come from kunal banerjee of brigade capital management please go ahead kunal banerjee first question on the landspring progress you talked about red gold any other customers that are encouraged by what’s going on at red gold and then if you could just handicap the size of the red gold opportunity now with the doubling or potential doubling of the acreage there with the additional crops jordi ferre first yes red gold it’s seen as very positive and that will have an effect on other customers i would like to remind the fact that the improving in united states is for everything but california we’re still two third of the potential so that is still not there in play but in the rest of the united states yes we see that all these other approvals will double basically the potential we have in the us ex california kunal banerjee and what will it take for california to fall in line or is that just not going to happen jordi ferre i will not like to comment on what we’re doing on regulatory what i would like to say that obviously we would like to see the whole of the us using landspring kunal banerjee okay and then  and just in terms of handicapping is it a low singledigit million dollars opportunity or  just rough numbers there would be helpful jordi ferre i think that when california comes in play you will see a potential of a few million dollars kunal banerjee okay and then just on the financials i think there was a statement saying expected to be at an  million per quarter average for 0 but you were over that let’s say  million so  times  is  and you had  million so do the other three quarters then total  million is that the way we should look at it or are you just saying that it’s going to revert to  million or it’s going to track at  million quarterly for q through q kathy harper we do expect the balance of the quarters to fall below that  million run rate kunal banerjee okay okay so okay that’s good and then just looking at the last slide 0 your reconciliation from gaap to nongaap to arrive at the  million of ebitda doesn’t seem like you excluded any of those oneoffs in the sga such as litigation cost and strategic review so is that  am i right in that conclusion kathy harper that’s correct we had announced in the third quarter of  that we were moving away from all those adjustments because we think that management and stakeholders are better served by us managing the business by ebitda not adjusted ebitda kunal banerjee okay but i mean just qualitatively speaking your quarter could’ve been better if those oneoff costs were not incurred right your underlying business was actually reflective of something closer to  million i mean ex those costs which aren’t going to recur kathy harper correct operator and the next question will come from francesco pellegrino of sidoti  company please go ahead francesco pellegrino just a couple of questions the first person was could you guys briefly comment on the effectiveness of smartfresh as part of the quality system in contrast to a standalone product jordi ferre i think that smartfresh has the same effectiveness whether it’s part of a quality system or it’s a standalone product what happens is when you do a system basically you have other things that in combination can give you better results right so there is synergies in using harvista and smartfresh for instance so that is a positive and there is other things as well that we’re doing there the advanstore is basically measuring that effectiveness so not all of that is being included in that system will necessarily have an impact it has other role like i say advanstore will measure that effectiveness yes but eventually like harvista and smartfresh adjust together they have one plus one makes three francesco pellegrino makes sense and could you also comment on maybe some lessons learned from pricing in the northern hemisphere during the first quarter jordi ferre i think that the biggest lesson we have learned in places like just to give you an example the market in argentina where we saw increased competition is that when you put the services together and you sell them as a platform it’s very effective competitively in argentina harvista plays a big role and harvista and smartfresh together both in terms of the effectiveness that we just talked before but also in terms of how you price it and approach customers does have a positive effect and impact so we expect that we take those lessons and actually we’ll bring more into it into the northern hemisphere because we will have other elements as we already announced and others that will be announced that we’ll add on to that smartfresh quality system one of them obviously is advanstore which is very well received by our customers and has definitely a place and a role in detection of what’s going on in those rooms for all the other things that i said we’ll be announcing in q we’re launching into that platform operator the next question will be a followup from brian nolan of jp morgan please go ahead brian nolan one of the things you guys had mentioned on the previous call you think you might look for alternative methods of distribution for harvista have you made any progress on that side can we expect to see multiple speakers in north america jordi ferre yes we yes i made a reference there is a number of ongoing discussions right now i cannot make an announcement at this point but i hope that next quarter probably i will be able to make an announcement in that respect but yes we are very very active in different discussions and engagements we’re having with partners that can complement what we already can do in the apple business operator and ladies and gentlemen

investing in growing stevia – and farmer incomes – sustainably by jordi ferre  apr   share i’ve just arrived at silvio pettirosi airport in the capital city of asunción in paraguay mariano demaria who leads purecircle paraguay is here to greet me together we will make the long journey to the stevia fields in rio verde in the northern region of the country it’s only about 0 miles from asunción but it can take us over four hours – first by car before the roads get too rough and then we must switch to an atv to navigate the distinctly rich red claylike dirt roads  it’s beautiful here – hot and moist and the sun is beating down on my head i wish i had remembered to bring my hat my discomfort aside it does make for ideal yearround growing conditions for stevia we have been working with hundreds of small scale farmers here for many years and i am always impressed by the warm yet reserved welcome of the people here i can feel a sense of pride as they walk me through their stevia fields and show me all they have accomplished in the latest planting and harvesting season i want to check on a new stevia variety we are growing here we’ve been looking at how the plant does in the different soil conditions around the world and so far we’ve been making some incredible strides in paraguay but my main focus for this week is to meet prospective new farmers and to hear about the progress we are making in recruiting new farmers to join us in our mission to make stevia available to millions around the world although the stevia plant is native to paraguay it is quite difficult to find farmers with the knowledge and skills to successfully grow stevia as well as the willingness to take a risk and try something new it’s why we have invited a group of prospective stevia farmers to our nurseries in guayaiví where our agronomists show them the type of support that we provide for them to be successful—everything from how to plant seedlings and use other growing materials we provide the best way to irrigate their land and how to reduce unnecessary waste we will introduce them to the  program a collaboration between purecircle and paraguayan ministry of agriculture which provides financial assistance and critical equipment to support smallscale farmers through this program a firstyear farmer can receive significantly greater income compared to other crops resulting in substantial improvements in the standard of living for these farmers and their families their success is vital to us this is why i think of the farmers we partner with truly as our customers and believe in the importance of understanding what they need to be successful in holistic and sustainable ways it has not been easy it’s a deeprooted belief in the positive impact of stevia and passionate commitment to partnering directly with farmers and farming communities that has been the foundation of how we work here and it’s a commitment we share as partners with cocacola we plan to continue to invest in growing stevia at neverbeforeseen levels here ampampampampampampampnbsp it’s the end of the day and i’m happy to see we have several farmers interested in doing trials with stevia it may not seem like a significant number but for us it’s these small steps that are required to take leaps and bounds as i head back to the city i think about my upcoming trip to kenya next month although far apart paraguay and kenya have become the ‘base’ for our stevia operations in south america and africa respectively from which we have expanded to more than  countries the farmers in kenya are different in many ways and yet very much the same i’m eager to see our progress firsthand jordi ferre is chief operating officer for purecircle he has been with purecircle for eight years and now leads the company’s entire supply chain – from farming to final stevia leaf extract as well as global commercial operations under jordi’s leadership purecircle has expanded leaf growing
