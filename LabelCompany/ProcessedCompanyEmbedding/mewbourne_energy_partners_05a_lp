normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly our financial position results of operations cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods presented the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the full year new accounting pronouncements in february  fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires additional information to be disclosed principally in respect of level  fair value measurements and transfers to and from level  and level  measurements in addition enhanced disclosure is required concerning inputs and valuation techniques used to determine level  and level  fair value measurements the guidance is generally effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   however the requirements to disclose separately purchases sales issuances and settlements in the level  reconciliation are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within such years early adoption is allowed the partnership does not anticipate any effect from this on its financial position or results of operations in january  fasb issued accounting standards update asu  “oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures” to provide consistency with the new sec rules the asu amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under us gaap with the requirements in the sec rules the partnership adopted the new standards effective december   the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate        table of contents    accounting for oil and gas producing activities the partnership follows the fullcost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities under the fullcost method all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized depreciation depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the unitsofproduction method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties at march   and  all capitalized costs were subject to amortization proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool gains and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties there was no cost ceiling writedown at march   whereas at march   there was a  cost ceiling writedown in january  the sec issued revisions to the natural gas and oil reporting disclosures “modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule” the “final rule” in january  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” updated its oil and gas estimation and disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the sec’s modernized oil and gas reporting rules the update amends the definition of proved reserves to use the average of firstdayofthemonth prices during the twelve months preceding the end of the reporting period adds definitions used in estimating and disclosing proved oil and natural gas quantities and expands the disclosures required for equitymethod investments the update must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and is effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending on or after december   the partnership adopted the new standards effective december      asset retirement obligations the partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future plugging and abandonment costs the estimated liability is based on historical experience and estimated well life the liability is discounted using the creditadjusted riskfree rate revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership interests or well plugging and abandonment costs or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements the partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well a reconciliation of the partnership’s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the three months ended march   and the year ended december   is as follows

date of inception its managing general partner is mewbourne development corporation a delaware corporation �md� a registration statement was filed pursuant to the securities act of  as amended registering limited and general partnership interests in a series of two delaware limited partnerships formed under mewbourne energy  drilling programs general and limited partnership interests were offered at  each the maximum offering amount was   interests per partnership the registrant was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on june�  on july�  the offering of limited and general partnership interests in the registrant was closed with interests aggregating  originally being sold to  subscribers of which  were sold to  subscribers as general partner interests and  were sold to  subscribers as limited partner interests the registrant engages primarily in oil and gas development and production and is not involved in any other industry segment see the selected financial data in item� and the financial statements in item� of this report for a summary of the registrant�s revenue income and identifiable assets the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the registrant will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the registrant�s control these factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products competitive fuels refining transportation extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas and other competitive conditions it is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the registrant the registrant does not have longterm contracts with purchasers of its crude oil or natural gas the market for crude oil is such that the registrant anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce natural gas will be sold to local distribution companies gas marketers and end users on the spot market the spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas without longterm contractual commitments the future market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty and the registrant may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices many aspects of the registrant�s activities are highly competitive including but not limited to the acquisition of suitable drilling prospects and the procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment and are subject to governmental regulation both at federal and state levels the registrant�s ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing general partner�s staff and facilities none of which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration development and production industry as a whole federal and state regulation of oil and gas operations generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage the imposition of maximum allowable production rates the taxation of income and other items and the protection of the environment �  table of contents the registrant does not have any employees of its own

dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the registrant�s business during the period for which this report is filed the production of oil and gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors although the price received by the registrant for natural gas sales will generally tend to increase during the winter months order backlog is not pertinent to the registrant�s business item�����
