to vote against merger between sabra health care reit inc and care capital properties inc major sabra shareholder tells board that doubling down on skilled nursing facilities by purchasing ccps increasinglytroubled portfolio would hurt companys longterm growth news provided by eminence capital lp jul    et share this article new york july   prnewswire  eminence capital lp which owns  percent of the common stock of sabra health care reit inc nasdaq sbra today sent the following letter to the board of directors regarding their announced merger with care capital properties inc nyse ccp july   richard k matros chairman  board of directors  sabra health care reit inc   von karman avenue suite   irvine ca  dear chairman matros and members of the board of sabra health care reit inc we are writing this letter in regard to your proposed acquisition of care capital properties nyse ccp ccp announced may    eminence capital lp owns  of sabra health care reit inc nasdaq sbra sabra or the company and plans to vote against the deal  our opinion is predicated on the following skilled nursing facilities snfs are under tremendous pressure for various reasons and we see no end in sight  ccp is  exposed to snfs and in our view its snf portfolio in particular is terribly positioned to navigate through this increasingly challenged industry these pressures will drive larger rent cuts and more dramatic portfolio repositioning versus what the company represents resulting in value destruction for shareholders  the company is swapping its own valuable currency for ccp assets that will be worth materially less threetofive years from now in its public filings the company makes it clear that asset class diversification is an achievement  we therefore have serious questions with respect to the motivation and rationale for this deal while we emphasize poor strategic fit as our primary issue with the transaction the price sabra is paying is also meaningfully too high below are the specific and significant challenges faced by ccp as of the first quarter of   of rents were covered at less than x ebitdar up dramatically from  just one quarter ago and  one year ago in retrospect sabra managements claims during its first quarter  earnings call which was held before ccp released its first quarter  earnings supplement that ccps portfolio had not deteriorated relative to the prior quarter were clearly disingenuous  of rents are concentrated in its topfive operators where the combined coverage is x and overall portfolio samestore cash rents are in yearoveryear decline signature healthcare ccps second largest tenant representing  of rent is going through significant financial distress and could very likely need to file for bankruptcy protection sabra management is well aware of this but we believe that based on the continued industry stress this is not a straight forward situation where coverage needs to be reset at a modestly higher level signature could have continued deterioration for years to come that needs to be considered on its third quarter  earnings conference call and during subsequent followup conversations ccp began talking about some of its tenants requesting rent concessions which when coupled with the trends in coverage is very concerning the ccp portfolios average star rating is among the worst in the industry relative to other large or reitowned portfolios a reflection of poorquality assets the quality rating system is a program administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms and is increasingly being used by snf referral sources as a means to determine which snfs to partner with and where to send patient referrals a difficult operating environment makes it extremely challenging to turn these assets around these trends and absolute levels of portfolio coverage are particularly problematic given our belief that industry conditions will remain just as poor if not deteriorate further during the coming years  based on extensive primary research our view is that snf industry profitability will decline meaningfully over the next threetofive years  the primary drivers of this fundamental outlook are traditional medicare ffs to medicare advantage – snfs have seen and will continue to see tremendous profit pressure from a mixshift towards medicare advantage now representing roughly onethird of all medicare beneficiaries which carries significantly shorter lengths of stay and lower per diem payments to snfs medicare represents the large majority of industry profitability given its extremely high profit margins relative to medicaid we believe the strong growth in medicare advantage penetration will continue as will the consequent pressure on snf profitability valuebased reimbursement – snf referral sources hospitals in particular are becoming increasingly responsible for and incentivized around managing a patients overall cost and quality of care ie before during and after the hospital stay this shift from volume to value exposes waste within the healthcare continuum by forcing hospitals to more strongly consider the highestquality lowestcost sites of care snfs are very poorly positioned in this debate – hospitals are cutting snf referral networks by more than  and shortening lengths of stay for patients they do still send to snfs cost inflation – labornursing the largest cost item for snfs is feeling the effects of wage inflation nursing turnover at snfs can be incredibly high and these facilities struggle to recruit and retain top talent a in a world of staffing supply shortages and b given the competitive disadvantages versus deeperpocketed hospitals we believe wage inflation has moved from  to more like  which can be troublesome when snf revenues are declining added regulatory burden – the majority of snfs are  years old and in need of massive capital investment these lowerquality underinvested facilities play a role in the poor quality and compliance controls known to the industry not surprisingly we have witnessed an increased number of government investigations into various players in the space in addition newly passed regulations require snfs to comply with timeintensive and costly mandates reimbursement risk – for years and to a greater extent more recently certain independent advisory groups and regulatory authorities have recommended payment reform for snfs which in our opinion is a function of flaws in the current payment system and misaligned incentives leading to generous medicare margins over the years snfs have increasingly billed for the highest categories of therapy despite key characteristics of snf beneficiaries remaining unchanged resulting in billions in overpayments we believe significant payment reform will take place in the foreseeable future and that it is likely to be negative for snfs traditional medicaid to managed medicaid – states are increasingly outsourcing the management and reimbursement for snf patient populations to managed medicaid players similar to certain effects the shift from traditional medicare to medicare advantage has on snfs this shift towards more managed medicaid while still early days could have a significant effect on volumes length of stay and payment rates in recent presentations the company has illustrated rent cut scenarios for the ccp portfolio  we view this as an attempt to reassure shareholders that the portfolio can withstand a rent cut and the deal would still be modestly accretive to funds from operations ffo  however we believe the companys analysis is deeply flawed and that nearterm accretion will turn into significant longterm earnings dilution sabra is underestimating the risk – the companys scenarios suggest that ccp may see a rent cut of approximately   in our view the cut should reasonably be  or greater   we believe sabra management is overly focused on the nearterm issues at signature as the only major problem  we see no end in sight for the industry pressures  we believe there will be continued pressure on rent over the next threetofive years and given ccps poor relative positioning its portfolio will witness trends that are at least as bad as what we predict for the industry over the years sabras management and board have done an admirable job recognizing the need to diversify the companys portfolio and executed on this strategy  in its  proxy statement the company discussed this success as achievements related to diversifying the investment portfolio  in its first highlight supporting this demonstrated success it reads we further diversified our investment portfolio by tenant asset class and geography  in continuing to discuss further diversification success from its largest tenant genesis healthcare inc genesis sabra goes on to say upon completion of the genesis sales these asset sales and amendments will have the benefit of reducing our revenue concentration in genesis and skilled nursing facilities…  the proxy makes it very clear that the company views asset class diversification as a clear success  yet despite this prudent strategy applauded by both shareholders and the board management is unjustifiably reversing course by increasing its snf exposure back to  from   we have a very hard time understanding the rationale or motivation behind such a deal  two possible theories could be sabra is extremely worried about its largest tenant genesis  the company is desperate to diversify away more quickly andor plug the hole in ffo and is obtuse to the fact that less exposure to genesis does not make sense if its new exposure is even more problematic  the belief that sabras cost of capital over the longterm will be lower if it diversifies is misguided because they are embarking on a flawed strategy of swapping one bad hand for one even worse acquiring ccp will increase sabras market cap by x  per the proxy the compensation committee benchmarks management compensation against a list of companies that are of a similar size  a material increase in the market cap would leapfrog sabra into a peer group with a larger market cap and correspondingly higher range of compensation given our views on the snf industry and ccp in particular we would have a very hard time justifying a price at which this deal makes sense  we would however be remiss to not mention our view that the company is significantly overpaying for this asset even putting our strategic concerns aside  management has said that it paid an initial cap rate of   however when adjusted for potential nearterm rent cuts that rebase coverage merely to industry averages that falls to the mid range per management  relative to the  range where we believe other snf portfolios trade in the marketplace sabra is paying a huge premium  finally while this deal may be nearterm accretive we strongly believe it will be decidedly dilutive after larger rent adjustments and continued industry pressures  as sabra shareholders we recommend that the company take an alternative path – one similar to the previous strategy of diversifying away from large tenants snfs and government reimbursement and we welcome the opportunity to discuss this further sincerely ricky c sandler  chief executive officer and  chief investment officer about eminence capital lp  eminence
