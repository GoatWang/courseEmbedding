paint  choosing an interior paint sheen sheen refers to paints shininess when deciding on paint sheen consider the condition of the wall and whether the area is highlow traffic heres a partial list to get started flat or matte sheen provides great depth of color and is ideal for lessthanperfect surfaces eggshell pearl and satin sheens are light easy to clean work great in high traffic areas and reveal color with a softly polished glow semigloss sheens are particularly durable and are often recommended for moldings and trim choosing an exterior paint sheen our superpremium products offer the same durability and washability in all sheens so the selection of the finish is more of a personal preference but here are a few things to remember flat is good at hiding surface imperfections and delivers beautiful color satin stays cleaner and stands up to abrasion better than flat semigloss is more moisture resistant and easier to clean highgloss allows rich deep color but magnifies surface imperfections choosing a stain finish stain opacity levels range from clear to solid with the amount of pigment in a stain determining its opacity translucent semitransparent and semisolid stains are designed to protect without completely obscuring the natural color and texture of wood as the opacity moves towards solid less grain shows through the finish in contrast solid stains will completely mask the wood grain while allowing the wood texture to show through and the greater its protection will be over time what is voc voc means volatile organic compounds the paint industry is filled with
