than  years with generations of the family overseeing the brewery through thick and thin we’ve never wavered on our values of hard work dedication and the stubborn resolve to brew the best beer we know how early days the long road in  german brewing apprentice adolph coors headed to america he made his way across the country working a series of odd jobs from bricklayer to gardener within five years he founded the golden brewery where it still stands today first things first mr coors headed west and refused to rest until he found the perfect water for his beer water he discovered flowing through the mining town of golden colorado at the base of the rockies     a legend is born as the story goes it was the hardworking miners of golden who gave our beer its name in the coming years “the banquet beer” would become synonymous with coors   the th century drained but not depleted when prohibition hit colorado in  the brewery was ordered to drain  barrels of beer undaunted mr coors leaned on new business ventures such as manufacturing porcelain and producing malted milk for candy companies until april   when the beer flowed again a symbol of resolve by the s banquet’s distribution was limited to just a handful of states in the western us the brewery unveiled the stubby bottle in  and after  dry years the iconic bottle became a symbol of standing tall in the face of adversity a packaging pioneer after years of development bill coors scrapped the traditional tin can and introduced a more environmentally friendly aluminum container this sparked a recycling revolution and the aluminum can soon became industry standard building the mystique despite its limited distribution thirst for coors was booming by the s legends abound of presidents celebrities and everyday folks stocking up to haul the precious beer back east   this day and age beer for all for decades banquet was only available in  states all west of the mississippi river the beer wouldn’t find its way east until  but demand continued to grow and it was in  that coors finally showed up in all  states heritage you can hold the banquet beer’s rich heritage is something to be celebrated so we wanted to do it as authentically as possible inspired by our history the banquet heritage cans are our annual toast to the banquet spirit past and present stubby makes a comeback after more than  years in the

the aflcios general counsel was up to his elbows in work one day in november  when his phone rang calling was robert h chanin his counterpart at the national education association the nations largest labor union chanin was on a secret diplomatic mission he told gold that his union had been informally contacted by the adolph coors company which was seeking an end to the labor federations sevenyear boycott of coors beer the nea had just voted to support that ban chanin asked what it would take for the aflcio to end the boycott but to his surprise gold didnt know the aflcio had been caught up in implementing the boycott not ending it chanin says today the fight against the adolph coors company was one of the most bitter labormanagement struggles of the last  years after  brewery workers struck coors in  unions poured millions of dollars into a consumer boycott that effectively helped stunt the companys growth coors ferociously antiunion is the company political liberals love to hate and the boycott became a cause celebre of the s millions of people shunned coors beer just as sympathizers with migrant workers had banished grapes from their refrigerators in the s and s chanins phone call however sparked three years of negotiations that last fall produced what many thought impossible  an agreement between the aflcio and coors that ended the boycott it is a classic tale of labormanagement relations  of two enemies slinging arrows at each other for years until battered by a changing economy they needed each other badly enough to compromise the agreement was largely the work of two men  peter h coors greatgrandson of the companys founder and president of its brewery division since  and thomas r donahue secretarytreasurer of the aflcio  both of whom are trying to steer their organizations into the future under the guidance of peter coors and his older brother jeffrey president of the adolph coors company the brewery is attempting to double within five years its current  percent share of the american market in order to contend in a troubled industry that everyone expects to be dominated by three or four breweries by the end of the century coors and the whole beer industry are under siege says frank walters research director for m shanken communications publishers of several alcoholicbeverage industry periodicals the beer market will not grow because of the trend in moderation the older population and the higher drinking age on the other side donahue has been trying to halt organized labors slide toward irrelevancy since president reagans celebrated dismissal of striking airtraffic controllers in  american companies have become more skillful and more determined in resisting or breaking unions union membership dropped from  million in  to slightly less than  million in  organized labor has been in such desperate straits that the coors settlement has been perceived as a victory  even though the workers at coors are still without a

brewery store the banquet backstory the history of coors stretches back more than  years with generations of the family overseeing the brewery through thick and thin we’ve never wavered on our values of hard work dedication and the stubborn resolve to brew the best beer we know how early days the long road in  german brewing apprentice adolph coors headed to america he made his way across the country working a series of odd jobs from bricklayer to gardener within five years he founded the golden brewery where it still stands today first things first mr coors headed west and refused to rest until he found the perfect water for his beer water he discovered flowing through the mining town of golden colorado at the base of the rockies     a legend is born as the story goes it was the hardworking miners of golden who gave our beer its name in the coming years “the banquet beer” would become synonymous with coors   the th century drained but not depleted when prohibition hit colorado in  the brewery was ordered to drain  barrels of beer undaunted mr coors leaned on new business ventures such as manufacturing porcelain and producing malted milk for candy companies until april   when the beer flowed again a symbol of resolve by the s banquet’s distribution was limited to just a handful of states in the western us the brewery unveiled the stubby bottle in  and after  dry years the iconic bottle became a symbol of standing tall in the face of adversity a packaging pioneer after years of development bill coors scrapped the traditional tin can and introduced a more environmentally friendly aluminum container this sparked a recycling revolution and the aluminum can soon became industry standard building the mystique despite its limited distribution thirst for coors was booming by the s legends abound of presidents celebrities and everyday folks stocking up to haul the precious beer back east   this day and age beer for all for decades banquet was only available in  states all west of the mississippi river the beer wouldn’t find its way east until  but demand continued to grow and it was in  that coors finally showed up in all  states heritage you can hold the banquet beer’s rich heritage is something to be celebrated so we wanted to do it as authentically as possible inspired by our history the banquet heritage cans are our annual toast to the banquet spirit past and present stubby makes a comeback after more than  years in the vault the  stubby bottle made its triumphant return to stores and watering holes all over the country   coors
