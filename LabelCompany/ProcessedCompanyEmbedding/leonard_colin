mastering engineer our clients repeatedly say the same thing the sing master is a better sounding more creative and more balanced sounding master we have two main goals  our first goal is to make your music sound flawless both creatively and technically having the proper room and monitoring system to hear what is actually happening to make the correct decisions is paramount  our second goal is to make sure you are completely satisfied with the product and customer service we will work with you on your original mixes until you are satisfied and at no additional charge we have never charged for adjustments or tweaks although we are rarely asked to make them and we are always accessible for  on  conversations with clients about mixes and masters on the phone or in person at our facility  we have a beautiful facility and love it when our clients come in for mastering sessions so if you can make it we would love to have you we believe mastering should be approached in the same way as playing an instrument or singing a song if you sing a song and you don’t feel the song or connect with the song you are singing the performance is not going to be as strong and the audience has the ability to detect that lack of energy and engagement  mastering is much the same way feel is more important than technicality if there is a technical problem in the mix and it cannot be fixed without the loss of feel and vibe then it’s not really a problem  sometimes the right thing musically is the wrong thing technically and when that is the case musicality wins what is not done during the mastering process is many times more important than what is done with over  years of engineering experience mastering engineer colin leonard has amassed an extensive list of clientele and include
