cofounder profile  business insider enterprise bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × parker harris the littleknown nice guy who helped turn salesforce into san franciscos most powerful tech company eugene kim feb    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print salesforce cofounders marc benioff and parker harris salesforce parker harris was sitting by the windows of kinkaid’s a steakhouse in burlingame california gazing at the lake of anza lagoon when marc benioff walked in the lunch was set up at the request of benioff then a star oracle executive who had just returned from his sabbatical in india with a new startup idea he was looking for an engineer who he could partner with and harris had come highly recommended it was hard though to imagine anyone further removed from the silicon valley engineering standard harris was raised in north carolina went to a small liberal arts college in vermont and majored in english literature he was relatively unknown in silicon valley especially compared to benioff after the formalities benioff cut straight to the point “look” he told harris “i want to start a company a new software service” benioff’s idea was simple building an affordable customer relationship management crm software and delivering it entirely online as a service he wanted to make crm which helps salespeople to track leads and manage clients as easy as buying a book on amazon this was when most crm solutions were hosted on a companys own servers they took months or even years to install were extremely hard to use and cost millions of dollars benioff wanted to sell a cheaper crm with better quality built from the ground up on the web — or in the “cloud” — so companies of all sizes could deploy it with ease “so are you guys good is this something you’d be interested in doing” benioff asked harris harris was intrigued by the idea although he already had his own company harris knew this was an opportunity he couldn’t pass up the internet was blowing up and benioff’s idea was potentially revolutionary if it worked it could turn the entire software industry upside down even in the worst case parker thought benioff had enough valley connections that could lead to more opportunities harris told him “we’re some of the best people you’ll find in the valley” in march  benioff harris and two other founders from harriss old company launched salesforcecom in a tiny onebedroom apartment in telegraph hill fifteen years later salesforce has grown into the fifthlargest software company in the world with annual revenue of  billion and a market value of over  billion its the largest tech employer in san francisco with about  employees in the city and by  its headquarters will move into the newly built tallest building in san francisco the foot salesforce tower everybody knows benioff the largerthanlife ceo but harris is the mastermind behind salesforce’s product and engineering and is just as responsible as benioff for building the most powerful tech company in san francisco outboxsystemscom a computer and math whiz with a flair for literature in  apple released the original apple ii its first major product to hit the mainstream personal computer market  that same year an th grader in north carolina got a first taste of computer programming when his grandfather bought him an apple ii his school also had some of the first apple iis in the state he became instantly obsessed with computers that kid was parker harris the son of a textile salesman harris grew up loving computers and math he first started coding in th grade and used cassette tapes to store programs he was a big fan of atari’s pong video game too but harris also had an affinity for french and classic literature reading was one of his favorite pastimes he was fluent in french after spending his high school senior year in france  so when the time came to go to college harris ditched computer science and instead majored in english literature at middlebury a small liberal arts college in vermont  “i was able to work the other side of my brain” harris tells business insider you can read our full interview with him here but after college harris drifted back to what he truly loved computer programming he started with a job in montreal canada building customized accounting software — in french for the mac no less it was fun but the market was too narrow a few years later year old harris moved to san francisco with his boss who was branching out once he got to the bay area a whole new set of opportunities opened up eventually he ended up launching a java programming company called left coast software with two cofounders dave moellenhoff and frank dominguez although a startup left coast software knew what they were doing one of their consulting clients was saba software an hr software maker that went public in  its ceo bobby yazdani was so impressed by the three guys that he wanted to acquire them but they wanted to grow something from the ground up and declined the offer so when benioff asked for talented engineers in the fall of  yazdani recommended the three left coast guys salesforces first office was a onebedroom apartment in telegraph hill salesforce they werent sold on the salesforce idea right away  “it’s a crackpot idea” moellenhoff told benioff in one of their first meetings according to benioffs book behind the cloud although harris tells us moellenoff was just playing devil’s advocate with benioff at the time  to get them on board benioff had to explain his grand vision of “ending traditional software business” it wasn’t just about a better product at a fraction of the cost it was about replacing the long installation process and moving everything to the internet he wanted to fundamentally change the business model no more long term contracts or expensive licensing deals but only a simple  monthly subscription fee “technology is always becoming lower in cost and easier to use it’s a continuum let’s ride it” benioff told them there was also one final kicker harris wanted to work in san francisco back then it wasn’t common for tech companies to be in san francisco as most engineers worked in silicon valley the southern part of the bay area where companies like google yahoo and facebook are located “i have the same problem” benioff told harris “salesforce will be in the city”  all three developers were sold building the most efficient engineering team in internet history early salesforce investor and cnet cofounder halsey minor says its engineering efficiency was one of the things that made salesforce truly special “parker created one of the most efficient development organizations in the history of the internet” he told us that started at the very inception of the company some time in march  during their first week at salesforce harris called moellenhoff and dominguez to the living room of their office in telegraph hill walking to the whiteboard harris picked up a marker and started writing “do it fast simple and right the first time and did we mention fast” “these” harris said tapping the whiteboard with the marker “are going to be our key values” parker harris in the early years of salesforce salesforce harris’s point was more than mere rhetoric speed was vital because salesforce was offered entirely over the web a model now commonly called softwareasaservice saas back then most business software ran entirely on an employees pc sometimes pulling data from a companys own servers over a fast companyonly network internet connections werent as fast or as reliable as they are today and people would often object “i have to get all the way on to the internet to use saas products” the only way to overcome that objection was to make salesforces service lightning fast simplicity was also important because engineers back then almost took strange pride in making code needlessly complex harris and the team knew this was slowing down the development process and made scaling difficult  the third point — doing it right the first time — may seem a little outdated now that everybody knows facebooks famous mantra move fast and break things  but doing things this way hinders speed if you want to grow fast you cant be taking time to fix a lot of mistakes it also reflects the difference between enterprise and consumer services if facebook goes down the only company thats really hurt is facebook and its advertisers if salesforce goes down its customers will lose sales and revenue these three values allowed salesforce to keep a historically small engineering team for years when it went public in  salesforce only had about  developers in total an astoundingly small number for a company that was making almost  million a year in revenue  a huge calculated bet parker’s brilliance was most apparent when he orchestrated the company’s transition to a development process called agile development”  it was in  and salesforce had grown so big that the engineering team was no longer able to sit within hearing distance of each other things had noticeably slowed down product updates were not as frequent and people were getting frustrated  until then salesforce had used a traditional development process called “waterfall” which is linear and based on a predetermined schedule and budget it was supposed to be more predictable but it was getting too inefficient especially as the team got bigger so two salesforce engineers chris fry and steve greene proposed harris a pilot project to transition to agile development it’s a more iterative approach that relies on small crossfunctional teams to work on shorter development cycles agile also makes it easier to push out quick and regular updates — a huge advantage for any saas business like salesforce with traditional software customers buy and install the software once then expect little improvement until the next major release one of the big advantages of the saas model salesforce pioneered is that customers can get a steady stream of improvements but that only works if the company can deliver them harris liked the agile idea only he wanted to take it a step further “let’s skip the pilot and go for the big bang” parker told his team “our system is broken and we don’t have time to wait — so let’s go ahead and fix it all at once” “it was a huge calculated bet” says ron pragides former salesforce engineer who’s now the svp of engineering at bigcommerce “if parker had made the wrong call and the engineering team had not reacted right away salesforce would have been on a different trajectory”  at first there was strong resistance in fact one of the leading experts in the field even declined an advisory role because of its risky nature  but parker insisted on it and pushed fry and greene to move ahead he knew if he didn’t speed up and simplify salesforce’s development process as soon as possible the company would fall into a crisis situation for the following few weeks the whole engineering team came to a halt and went through a rigorous training process eventually in just three months more than  engineers spread across  teams had made the full transition to agile the move has been a massive success after the shift salesforce says it takes  less time for major releases while the overall productivity has gone up by   former salesforce chief marketing officer tien tzuo now the ceo of zuora says that was a huge moment for harris as a leader “that was a big growth moment for parker it really allowed the organization to scale and it really allowed parker to scale with it” agile development has improved efficiency at salesforce slidesharesteve greene the yin to benioffs yang for all the success that has accompanied salesforce harris is still relatively unknown outside of enterprise tech circles  some have compared him to apple cofounder steve wozniak steve jobs’ engineering partner and the late oracle cofounder bob miner who was the architect of its database technology — two technical masterminds who were overshadowed by their respective largerthanlife cofounders benioff is a foot pound force of nature with an outsized personality he was oracle founder larry ellison’s most trusted disciple by age  he was banking  a year was named oracle’s youngest vp and drove a fancy ferrari mondial cabriolet he’s a natural leader tall and big fistpounding and arrogant at times  harris on the other hand is average height with a lanky frame he’s calm laconic and a good listener he barely had any big company experience before salesforce he still goes to his children’s soccer games on the weekends cheering on the sidelines while other dads don’t even notice he’s filthy rich and successful  “you would never know just by chatting with him that parker’s one of the most successful engineers in silicon valley” says john dillon salesforces first ceo who left the company after a fallingout with benioff but their opposing personalities might be why they work together so well  parker harris is the voice of reason while ceo marc benioff is the visionary according to chuck dietrich ceo of mileiq who spent  years at salesforce as gm and vp  “they’re the yinandyang it’s not the optimistpessimist but more like a futurist and reality” says dietrich “i do think it’s sort of a match made in heaven” brian millham president of global commercial sales at salesforce tells us “marc always set the vision for where we wanted to go as a company parker was always the one to say ‘ok we could deliver that but let’s not assume that’s coming out next quarter’” “marc has a big ego” exceo dillon argues “that’s not necessarily bad marc has a lot to be proud of but he didn’t have a competitor with parker — so in that regard the partnership worked” early investor halsey minor agrees “if parker was as gregarious as marc it probably wouldn’t have worked but parker’s the opposite he’s just very complementary to marc” for example dietrich was once close to signing a major wireless carrier to a multimillion dollar deal which would have been one of the largest deals in salesforce history benioff was supportive along the way but it would have taken a lot of custom work and harris put a filter on it  “no let’s not do it” harris told the team “it’s too much work it would divert us from our multitenancy model” multitenancy means that a lot of customers share common components running in salesforces data center its common now with saas companies but back then it made a lot of big customers wary — when they run things in their own data centers they control every part and know where to look when something goes wrong multitenancy adds uncertainty but parker knew that overcommitting to a single deal could dilute salesforces focus and result in underdelivering features that were promised to every other customer in parker’s view no matter how big the deal was it was more important to keep it evenkeeled even if that made many sales managers disappointed at dropping their potential deals it turned out to be the right call as salesforces success since then shows parker harris dressed as doc from back to the future during a presentation at dreamforce flickr but at the same time benioff also pushes harris to realize benioffs vision of the future harris would be the first to agree with this notion “marc’s very much the idea guy it’s hard to keep up with marci have to assimilate to a lot of that so my tendency is to want things to be organized work together make sense and sometimes tolerate inconsistencies” he says take for example the fitbit the activity tracking wearable device around  just after fitbit demonstrated its first tracking product at a tech show in san francisco benioff would often hand out free fitbits during management meetings he would tout it as the future of tech when wearable wasn’t even part of tech lingo people had no clue what he was talking about fast forward to  benioff and parker were presenting their newest product a data analysis platform called wave analytics as the future of salesforce the huge amount of data generated by devices like the fitbit is now a big part of the big data trend and harris thinks it will spur the companys next wave of growth that has happened again and again looking at the trends that we have gone through as a company where we started the company it’s all about cloud computing and we’re still cloud computing and then we went through this space on social when facebook came out that was amazing and then mobility we transformed the company we weren’t born as a mobile company but every company today is so we went through this mobile transformation and we talk a lot now as a company about what’s happening in the world of data science you know with massive grids of computers internet of things devices and all of this stuff we talk about harris says “marc is showing us a vision the direction” harris continues “and i’m right there with him figuring out how are we going to get there we bounce ideas off of each other to try to make it the right path together” nice guys dont finish last what makes harris a great leader however may just be the simple fact that he’s a truly nice human being in over dozens of interviews with harris’s friends and colleagues the same words repeatedly came up to describe him humble understated nice unassuming selfless caring likable and down to earth when we asked about the agile transition for instance harris deferred all the credit to fry and greene “i’m not going to take credit for all of that” he told us “what i’ll take credit for is finding visionary people in the company or bringing them in and then empowering them to help me” nancy connery salesforces first hr manager says harris is one of the nicest people shes ever met connery consulting nancy connery salesforce’s first hr manager says harris once came in to her office with flowers in hand when things were getting chaotic early on “you have a really hard job and i just wanted to thank you” he told her suzanne dibianca the president of the salesforce foundation says “i remember standing on a stool painting the ceiling at am in the morning before a major salesforce event and parker was right there standing right next to me” benioff too was deeply touched by harris on many occasions one of those moments occurred on the night before salesforce’s ipo in   salesforce had dinner at tao an upscale asian restaurant in new york city that has a foot buddha statue most of the early salesforce executives were there in the secondfloor private room to celebrate one of the biggest moments in company history  at one point harris walked up to benioff and handed him a gift a framed american express envelope it was the envelope benioff had used to scribble down salesforce’s firstever vmom — an acronym for vision values methods obstacles and measures — that has been the guide to every major company decision at salesforce from day  benioff brought the technique with him from oracle “i did throw that envelope in the drawer and saved it it was pretty cool to do something before an event like that” harris says what benioff and the other three founders wrote in that first vmom shows how salesforce has valued the “right people” from the very beginning the first value is “worldclass organization” and the first method is “hire the team” its also achieved other goals including maintaining amazon quality usability and going public the last measurement of success on the document we are all rich salesforce has done quite well on that front too according to a june  financial filing parker harris is still the secondlargest individual shareholder after benioff with about  million shares that means his stock alone is worth about  million he also gets regular grants and other compensation in  he earned more than  million from the company benioff meanwhile has almost  million shares worth about  billion so will harris be remembered alongside benioff as an equal partner in the companys success that seems to be the least of his concerns  “i’m very happy i’m not looking for that recognition marc deserves all the recognition” harris tells us  “i think the legacy is really the company that we built that’s what makes me happy” harris says with a smile “i’m a very simple person so that’s all i really need” see also see how salesforce has expanded from a small house to the tallest

the  billion cloud software company is its largerthanlife ceo marc benioff what many often fail to recognize is that he didn’t launch salesforce by himself there were three other cofounders parker harris dave moellenhoff and frank dominguez while moellenhoff and dominguez are no longer at the company harris still remains very involved with all product and engineering decisions harris is the quiet  man behind benioff you can read more about harris’s importance to salesforce here but that doesn’t mean he’s shy or introverted by any means he has proven to be an eloquent public speaker and has shown a sense of humor that plays well off of benioff’s more flamboyant style we found harris to be funny genial and down to earth but he was also very sharp and competitive in nature at one point saying “i want to keep beating a lot of people frankly” still it was clear harris didn’t have the greed and ego that has come to define many silicon valley tech entrepreneurs he’s fine with benioff taking most of the recognition he just wants to be remembered for the company and products he’s helped build here’s a lightly edited transcript of our conversation business insider tell us more about your first meeting with marc benioff  parker harris it was  so i was  i wasn’t that old i was much younger than i am now i had a small company that myself and actually two other cofounders of salesforce were running we were doing consulting at saba software which was down in burlingame right near kinkaid’s and the ceo bobby yazdani agreed to introduce me to marc really as a favor because he wanted to hire us and get our help building saba but we told him we really wanted to do something on our own and so he introduced me we had lunch i remember bobby and marc drinking tea it was kind of my one memory sitting around the table and we were just talking about this idea there was some talk marc was also an investor in saba so there was some talk of saba’s business and that kind of reminds me even to today of marc’s ability to be involved with so many things he’s quite the maven in ideas and just being aware of what’s out there so on one hand he was talking about saba’s business and on the other we were talking about this idea of salesforce and after the meeting marc and i took a walk to the parking lot and he said “is this something you’d be interested in doing” and it wasi didn’t really know who marc was but i just had this feeling that great things could happen whether it was that first idea or the next one that was kind of from that point on that was the feeling i got in being with him bi what did he tell first you did he kind of just give you a  page business plan ph at first obviously he did not hand the business plan to me at the lunch but he said “look i want to start this company a software service” and we’ve been doing some early software service work some for saba and some for other startups and it was around sales force automation which we knew very well from our previous employment at metropolis software and so that combination and the ability to go and start something and get some funding to start something in the space that we had experience in was just super exciting and then reading the business plan it was short it was like  pages but it was very cogent and made total sense you have to remember we were  guys in an apartment with a small consulting company paying our salaries so in terms of risk we had already taken the risk and we were way out there and so starting a company with marc was not a massive risk it was just an exciting opportunity bi so in benioffs book you told him “we’re some of the best people you’ll find in the valley” where did that confidence come from how did marc respond ph i don’t know where it came from it was just something i believed in it was just something that i believed deep down that i knew i had the talent dave moellenoff who became the original cto of the company and my other cofounder hes one of the most brilliant people i’ve ever met and i would atttribute to him a lot of the core architecture of the service and i think my ability to translate — that english literature degree ironically helped i have been programming in th grade but i was able to also work the other side of my brain and that helps me translate when i’m talking to marc who’s also technical by the way and then when i’m talking to someone deeply technical like a programmer it’s not just about being an engineer parker harris is not shy or introverted hes a great public speaker and has a good sense of humor bloomberg bi but did you guys kind of not take it too seriously at first in the book it says moellenhoff told marc “it’s a crackpot idea” was it more about getting access to marc’s valley connections hoping it would lead you to new opportunities ph no that was just kind of in the back of my mind like an insurance policy you know i just knewnothing terrible could happen that was really where that came from but we took it very very seriously and the pace we went at once we grabbed on the idea was fast we had to wind down some of our consulting contracts we didn’t want to drop the customers right away and that’s part of the philosophy that we carry to salesforce it’s really taking care of our customers but even before we officially started we were starting some of the coding and then once the official date started in april we were cranking this thing out because we just had it inside us we knew sales force automation we’ve been doing cloud computing pretty early and it was just super exciting because we saw the possibilities of what we could do in using cloud computing to provide enterprise software which we knew we could just provide a better solution we were thinking about scaling to the world we were thinking of these big world ideas of building a service and we took it very very seriously we were coming into it saying “this is great” we were having fun we were young it was awesome bi can you tell us more about that first lunch with marc ph marc really used that opportunity to have more of a private conversation with me the lunch was more social it was more kind of getting to know each other and it was conversations with bobby and what was going on at saba and it was at the parking lot that marc really pitched me and said “is this something you want to do” and it was definitely something i wanted to do and that was kind of how we felt so the next stop was getting dave moellenhoff on board he had an opportunity with a small company and he was doing some consulting for another company in a very different space and it was a debt arbitrage company that was later sold to moody’s financial services so a lot of cash no stock so it was just a different kind of world and part of it was dave just being a little conservative dave was kind of playing devil’s advocate with marc just more as an interview process for marc i was sold on day on i just thought this is going to be great marc’s awesome the idea’s solid we knew sales force automation we knew we could do it better than most people given the experience we had and then i knew i needed dave as well for me it’s not about the ideas it’s about the people and that’s why with marc it was so important i was like “wow this is amazing” but i needed dave moellenhoff as that other piece he really sealed it for me because i really needed his expertise as well bi looking back why do you think marc was so insistent on you guys you’re an english major with no big company experience  what made you such a great partner for him ph you have to know marc to understand that marc’s a very intuitive person he definitely will read the data so he would read a resume he would really try to understand the person on paper and their experience so he could look at my experience and get that but i’ve seen him time after time when he’s interviewing people you never know which way the conversation is going to go and it very much needs to be inperson facetoface looking at people in the eye and he strives a lot on that intuition to build the company and i think he and i just really clicked day one and you know it’s just a matter of trust and he knew a lot of smart people you have to understand that but he also knew a lot of smart people that he really wasn’t comfortable taking there were companies that he was invested in there were companies like oracle where later as you know in the story he did get permission to bring over a few people but he couldn’t just peel off part of oracle and start this and so he was looking for the team and i think he also valued that we were already a team it’s hard to build a synergy of multiple people and we were already a team ready to go but you know he did his diligence later he invited us down to meet some of his top tech people and we had lunch near oracle it was a thai restaurant i can’t remember what it was called it was on the west of  so the other side of redwood shores jim cavalieri who’s still here was at the lunch and some of the top architects of oracle were there and marc was having them basically interview us but he didn’t tell us about it he was just like “hey come have lunch” and again it’s an informal setting food talking but that’s kind of how ideas and decisions get made here at salesforce bi you had a historically small engineering team how did you manage to do it was it always about “simple fast and right the first time” ph i’ll attribute part of that to marc we were in the apartment i don’t know it was one of the first few weeks and we said “oh we need to get another developer in here” and we interviewed a developer and we thought “ok this seems like a good person to add” and marc said “hey have you done a coding test have you really interviewed this person” and we’re like “coding test huh no we didn’t do a coding test that’s probably a good idea why don’t we actually have him write some code on the whiteboard i think it was on the whiteboard at the time so the person came back in and did the coding test and we decided not to hire that person because in fact it would not have been the right person and that was one of the things that was key to the culture on day  we do need to hire people but we can only hire the best and we’ll take our time if we can’t find the best so that was part of it and then yeah “fast simple and right the first time” it was something that was ingrained in you know we wrote it on the board and we said “these are going to be our key values” part of it was we had to build something an internet service that was fast to use you have to remember softwareasaservice was not something that was accepted so people would say “oh i need to run the software myself because it’s not going to be fast if it’s running on the internet i have to get all the way over to the internet to get it” so it was all about speed and then “simple and right the first time” was about you know this was a service — it’s not something that i can ever throw out and start over again it’s going to be this living thing that’s always going to have care and feeding so it’s going to have to be simple and easy to understand and also the “right the first time” was about “we’re not going to solve a problem if we don’t know how to solve it in the right way” and some developers and the architects will say “oh i’m going to half around this for now and i’ll fix it later” but the problem is you never go back and really fix it later and it really wasn’t a concept that we put like “oh we don’t want more than x developers” we just were very very careful on how we grew and very careful about the code and architecture we wrote and i think that’s why ultimately the service we built was efficient bi so you grew up in north carolina how was your early childhood ph i grew up in north carolina my father was a salesperson he sold textiles north carolina was known for its textiles long ago less so now with all the business going to china i grew up loving computers and math actually i also loved english literature and french but i became obsessed with computers when the apple ii was coming out i remember my school had some of the first apple iis in north carolina i remember when i first started using them we were using a cassette tape to store programs because we didn’t have floppy disk drives and so you just recorded on the cassette tape to record and it sounded like a model the sound of the data being stored and my grandfather who started a textile company in north carolina gave me some money to buy an apple ii and i bought one and started programming so that was kind of the early days and i think i was influenced by video games simple ones like pong and i was fascinated by what makes that work and how do you draw something on the screen and if you drew something how does it know that it’s a ball how do you teach it to do things bi and then you went to middlebury for college how did you end up in san francisco ph i took a detour to france in my senior year in high school so that’s part of what ended up sending me actually to middlebury because i went to school with people who were more from the northeast and then from middlebury i went up to montreal with my girlfriend who’s now my wife and then i startedi was in montreal and i didn’t have a visa and so i couldn’t really work at first and my motherinlaw let me do some work in her house and then i got actually a visa through the free trade agreement and started working at a company called honey beats software in montreal and we did customized accounting software on the mac in french so it was arguably a small market and i was doing the development tech support consulting it was a ten person company and we were working for various small companies in montreal i did that for a number of years and that’s where and again someone took a chance on me and i built a lot of software with them and then the founder of that actually moved out to california and gave me an opportunity i was  and we said “oh why don’t we go to california we love san francisco let’s move out it’ll be really fun” and also of course it was for work a great place to be and so that’s really how we ended up out here parker harris with marc benioff on stage at dreamforce  youtube bi how would you describe your relationship with benioff what is it that make you guys such a good team for so many years ph well first of all we’re very good friends so that’s the basis of any good partnership and i would say marc is very much the idea guy and i’d like to say i am as well but it’s hard to keep up with marc and you read about him all the time and he is out there and he’s looking at the next idea and he was like that when we met him when he was at oracle i think that’s probably what larry ellison found so amazing about him as well that he’s just an idea maven he’s looking at new companies new ideas he’s talking to leaders at all levels he’s not looking to talk to the most important people he’s talking to the most interesting people if you come to our dreamforce event you see that you see everyone from world leaders to william to hilary clinton it’s all over the place and that’s just an example of marc’s insatiable appetite for these new ideas and new trends and where we’re going and that also translates to technology technologies that we need to build and companies that we look to purchase when we acquire companies we also look at companies to influence us and you know we go “wow look at what they’re doing isn’t that amazing” and i have to assimilate a lot of that and so i kind of think that the balance is marc is kind of out there he’s the idea guy and my tendency is to want things to be organized work together make sense and sometimes tolerate inconsistencies but that’s where i try to make the software that we build to really work well together we really focus on customers that’s what helps align both of us if we debate on what we need to do we just go out and ask customers what they want bi does marc wake you up in a sense to realize how far you can go ph i don’t know if i’d phrase it that way i think marc for example there’s articles out right now about data science and we’re talking a lot right now about what’s happening in data science and we’re looking at the trends that we have gone through as a company where we started the company it’s all about cloud computing and we’re still cloud computing and then we went through this space on social when facebook came out that was amazing and then mobility we transformed the company we weren’t born as a mobile company but every company today is so we went through this mobile transformation and we talk a lot now as a company about what’s happening in the world of data science you know with massive grids of computers internet of things devices and all of this stuff we talk about and then we market it so you look at how we talk as a company and then we market these things out to the world and then we listen and we take all of that back in and so marc is showing us a vision the direction and i’m right there with him figuring out how are we going to get there and he and i bounce ideas off of each other to try to make it the right path together bi marc’s this largerthanlife former oracle star executive but does it ever cross your mind that you should be more out in public to get more credit for what youve built ph you know what i actually think it’s fabulous and i’m very happy what drives me i’m not looking for that recognition and i think marc deserves all the recognition that he gets that’s part back to marc being out there and reallyhe was just in davos and he gets a ton of his energy from that kind of interaction being out there and talking to people and as a result of course turns into pr and articles about marc and his personality what drives me is the innovation and building things and so you can kind of see me in the products we put out there and the services we put out there and that’s what i’m behind and that’s what makes me happy i’m a very simple person so that’s all i really need bi what do you want your legacy to be ph i think the legacy is really the company that we built we transformed an industry and i think that’s fabulous i think there’s lots of small companies that are out there that are looking at us and seeing what they can do from our influence and i want to keep beating a lot of people frankly so there’s a competitive edge and then there’s just the industry in terms of what we’ve done with our foundation we’ve built a company that also gives back it’s part of our culture but we‘ve influenced a lot of other companies and so the thing about legacy you know doing a lot of good for the industry but also for the world at large i think that couldn’t be a better legacy bi opening up the api and building a platform — whose idea was it and was it a scary idea at the time ph i think in the book it talked about the evolution of the platform and there was an early customer called patient care that wanted to rename our tabs they were a hospital and didn’t like “contacts” and “accounts” you know they wanted “hospitals” and “patients” and dave and i said “just tell your users that ‘accounts’ are ‘hospitals’ i guess it’s very easy” laughs but marc of course was like “no of course we’ll transform and we’ll rename the tabs” and so i think marc pushed us on a few of those fronts on the platform but then the platform also just evolved from our customers our customers needed to integrate with us we started as sales force automation not full crm and so we were going in and we needed to enter ourselves in companies that already had a customer support system but now naturally you’re going to have to integrate that with their api layer so that opened up the service was it scary yeah it was scary we didn’t know how many transactions were going to hit us and could we scale it was a constantit’s always scary being a service and you can ask any service provider out there predicting capacity predicting demand making sure you’re keeping up with it it’s a really hard job and that’s kind of the depth behind a company like salesforce how do we deliver that kind of scale with security and reliability and redundancy it’s a really really hard job and so yeah it is scary but you know you just keep growing and you keep growing with each new customer and each new deal and each new industry makes us stronger bi it seems like you really try to create a better work environment for your engineers there’s something called “paid timeon” sort of like google’s  time and then there’s an internal jobs fair how important is it to you ph it’s very important we had a very “waterfall” process years and years ago and we brought in “agile” so that was an important transformation and you may have read an article about one of our engineering leaders chris fry he did an awesome job in helping me drive that and i’m not going to take credit for all of that but i think what i’ll take credit for is finding visionary people in the company or bringing them in and then empowering them to help me and so i really saw chris and steve greene as two people who could really help us and i got behind them and i empowered them and i pushed them hard to go fast they wanted to go slowly and not break things and i told them “no you need to go fast because we have a crisis in terms of needing agile” and then we wanted to make sure that with our culture we saw some people from time to time saying “i have a better job outside of the company and i want to go do this new thing” and we just said to ourselves “why do people have to leave the company to go do something else that they want to do why can’t we give them that opportunity” and it’s not natural for a manager to tell their engineer “if you want to go work for someone else i’m happy to help you” because that manager’s trying to build something and they don’t want to lose their best people and so we did create this internal job fair called opportunity open market where people can move around and again it was just something that grew from inside the organization that i embraced and i think that’si don’t think great ideas come from one individual i think one individual could potentially take credit for them but i think it’s about giving the right culture and the right people and finding those gems of ideas and helping them flourish bi so this thing called vmom is a really important at salesforce you framed the original vmom and gave it to marc ph yeah so marc brought the vmom process to salesforce it was something that he had been doing at oracle it’s an amazing planning process and he walked us through that very very early on and we were in his apartment next to our first office at coit tower when he grabbed an american express envelope from his mail turned it over to get to the blank side of it and started writing on it and talking with us and we iterated and sketched out a very simple first vmom and yeah i did throw that envelope in the drawer and saved it and then on the night of the ipo in new york city at tao the restaurant we had a private room up at the top of that restaurant with the big buddha a cool restaurant and on the night of the ipo i had it framed and wrote a note to him on the back and handed it to him i’m sure it’s somewhere in his home but i haven’t seen it since then i don’t think he cried but i know he was deeply touched and something like that it’s pretty cool to be able to do before an event like that bi so far salesforce has been very successful  billion in sales but how do you get to the size of  billion revenue company ph we get there by listening to our customers i think if you look at what we’ve been doing we started out with sales force automation we built a great business on that we’ve built a multi billion dollar pipeline with our service cloud marketing automation is also a massive opportunity but not just crm if you look at analytics that we just launched a product we launched at dreamforce last year that’s another multi billion dollar opportunity in the future and then a lot of what we’re doing around industry verticalization is another focus that we have taking all of crm and looking at whether it’s telecommunications financial services healthcare doing a lot more in those areas and so we have plans we’re going to keep growing we see growth going forward and again we’ll just keep iterating marc is the first person to tell you that we have a phrase “tactics dictate strategy” we don’t create the year plan and just go road by road we use our vmom process do it quarterly and we adjust and i think that’s what makes us a great company we’re willing to make the shifts when we need them look at when we came out with chatter when we reacted to social and when we came out with salesforce and really followed that mobility trend those were the big shifts when we bought exacttarget that was a big acquisition for us biggest that we’ve ever done and that was a big bold play in marketing automation and even the edgespring acquisitionwhich was small but turned into our analytics cloud has turned out to be another big bet so we’ll just keep doing that and again back to marc when i was talking about being an idea maven and just being out there trust me every day we’re talking about new ideas we don’t do them all but there’s a lot of talk and we do use that vmom process to get that iterative quarterly cadence to react accordingly more parker harris salesforcecom marc benioff facebook linkedin twitter email print × recommended for you powered by sailthru
