 yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk

exempt from federal and kentucky personal income taxes derived from kentucky municipal securities without incurring undue risk to principal strategy the fund seeks to provide a steady flow of taxexempt income derived from kentucky municipal securities of investment grade quality those rated bbb or baa or higher by us nationally recognized rating services at the time of purchase with a nominal maturity normally greater than  years the interest earned on these securities in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer is exempt from federal and state taxation in the state of kentucky risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption

returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment

risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also

government bond series taxable municipal bond series news faqs forms contact frequently asked questions what are taxfree municipal bonds why should i invest in a dupree fund vs buying an individual bond why should i buy a statespecific municipal bond fund vs a national municipal bond fund whats the difference between the two funds in ky nc and tn am i completely free of paying tax on this investment why is taxequivalent yield important to me how often do the funds pay dividends how long have you been around will i be assigned an adviserbrokerrepresentative with my account in the current environment how do i know my money is safe with you am i able to access my account online how do i get started  what are taxfree municipal bonds top   municipal bonds are debt securities issued by state and local governments to raise money for public projects such as schools sewers roads and other infrastructure the interest paid by taxfree municipal bonds is free from federal taxes and may be free from state taxes as well    why should i invest in a dupree fund vs buying an individual bond top   individual bonds can be attractive to some individual investors but there are drawbacks to consider transaction costs research and monitoring requirements and diversification concerns compel many investors to turn to municipal bond mutual funds dupree mutual funds hold many bonds with various maturities from various issuers carefully selected by our municipal bond professionals shareholders benefit from daily liquidity at nav you can buy and sell shares each day to meet investment goals or fulfill cash needs with no loads or transaction fees investors in dupree mutual funds own a small piece of each bond in the fund in which they invest and receive a proportional share of the interest income which accrues as a daily dividend and pays monthly or quarterly depending on the fund    why should i buy a statespecific municipal bond fund vs a national municipal bond fund top   national funds buy munis from many different states often including bonds from the largest municipal issuers such as california and new york shareholders in states which have state income tax may be required to pay such tax on some or all of the dividend income from a national muni fund unless the state makes no distinction between income earned from instate muni bonds and out of state muni bonds additionally national municipal bond funds often hold some bonds subject to amt statespecific dupree mutual funds are offered with  states in mind alabama kentucky mississippi north carolina and tennessee for residents of those states investment in the respective fund allows for dividend income free from federal and state taxes and amt many investors feel more comfortable owning bonds in their states of residence some believe that a national fund offers more diversification but we believe that a welldiversified portfolio of state county and local issues can be assembled that mitigates much of the risk of investing in a single state    whats the difference between the two funds in ky nc and tn top   for kentucky north carolina and tennessee we offer two different types of funds  an income series and a shorttomedium series the income series funds nominal maturity will usually average  years or more while the shorttomedium series nominal maturities will usually average  years longterm investors often prefer our income series funds as they have typically enjoyed higher yields investors harboring concerns about the potential for a sharp rise in interest rates typically prefer the shorttomedium series of course when interest rates rise all bond prices generally fall past performance is no guarantee of future results and new investors should closely examine the prospectus and fund attributes before selecting an investment we endeavor to provide the highest income without undue risk to principal in accordance with prospectus guidelines in all dupree mutual funds    am i completely free of paying tax on this investment top   dupree mutual funds offer dividend income free from federal and state income taxes and amt in the states corresponding to each fund residents of states other than the state named in the title of the fund for example an ohio shareholder buying shares of the kentucky taxfree income series still enjoy income free from federal income tax and amt but their income may be taxed at the state level residents of states such as florida without a state personal income tax enjoy fully taxfree dividends for all of our municipal bond mutual funds a table of the states in which dupree mutual funds are offered for sale is available here there are certain municipal bonds typically known as private activity bonds that offer income free from federal and state income tax but subject to the amt by prospectus dupree mutual funds does not buy such bonds for our municipal portfolios dupree dividend income is  amt free    why is taxequivalent yield important to me top   taxequivalent yield is an important concept for taxfree bond holders comparing yields on taxable bonds to taxfree munis is not an apples to apples comparison for example a taxable bond yielding  might seem like a better deal than a taxfree muni yielding  however if your combined state and federal marginal tax rate is  then the tax equivalent yield on the muni is actually      this means that you would have to buy a taxable bond yielding  to get as much aftertax income as a taxfree bond yielding  all else being equal investors must carefully evaluate their tax situation and other factors to determine whether or not taxfree bond funds make sense    how often do the funds pay dividends top   each fund holds many bonds that pay interest usually this interest is paid by the bonds twice a year but each bonds schedule is different we collect the interest on each of the bonds held in our funds and pay it out to shareholders as a mutual fund dividend all taxfree characteristics of the individual bonds are passed along to fund investors one of the advantages of a municipal bond mutual fund is that you dont have to wait for your bonds to make their coupon payments to get your income we know how much interest accrues each day on every bond we hold and we use this information each day to calculate a dividend factor which is the amount of dividend income that accrues on each share of the fund each day what this means is that no matter when you buy shares of our funds you immediately start earning interest on the shares you own if you sell shares of the fund at times other than the end of month or end of quarter you are paid the exact amount of dividend income you have accrued  theres never any reason to wait to make a transaction until a certain date to ensure you get the dividend income youre entitled to receive we pay out the full amount of accrued interest to shareholders on a regular schedule investors can either receive the interest in cash through ach to their bank account or a physical check in the mail our five income series funds pay dividends quarterly and our three shorttomedium funds and our government bond series pay dividends monthly    how long have you been around top   dupree mutual funds were first offered to investors in  the kentucky taxfree income series is the thirdoldest single state muni fund in the
