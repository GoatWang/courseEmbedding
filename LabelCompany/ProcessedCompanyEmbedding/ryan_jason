of flywire june   fresh tilled soil – by c todd lombardo product hero is our biweekly series that highlights outstanding members of the product management community these industry leaders share tips on processes team building how to be a better product manager and who they are outside of their careers this week our product heroes are ryan frere vp of global payments at flywire and jason moens vp of product c todd i’m here with two product heroes from flywire here in boston i’ll let you two introduce yourselves and tell us how you got into product jason do you want to start jason hi i’m jason moens vp of product at flywire i’ve been here for about seven years i joined flywire when it was just an interesting idea but had no customers revenue or product it seemed like a compelling idea – to help change the way people around the world move money especially for big purchases like medical care and tuition payments my history before flywire was in the payments and software space at a few startups and larger companies i was a software developer for about  years but the intersection of technology and business was always my focus so product always seemed like the best home for me now i’ve spent the last  years in product c todd awesome thank you ryan how about you tell us a little about your background how did you get into product and design ryan sure i’m ryan frere vp of global payments at flywire it’s funny hearing jason’s story because i came from the business path to product originally i was at a larger enterprise software company in an inside sales role i have a bit of a technical background and the more i dug into that product the more i knew there was a better way to build it at the time i didn’t know about product management as a function working closely with the product manager at the time he thought i could be a good fit for a product role so in  i moved over to product fast forward eight years mike massaro the ceo of flywire it was called peertransfer at the time called me about a product job here he saw my experience in education and international payments and here i am now it complimented very nicely to where jason was coming from on that side of domestic payments first and now we both jointly run product here from the two different perspectives c todd can you describe your relationship a bit more how do you deal with being two heads of product what does the division of work look like jason when flywire began we had really fundamental questions we kept asking ourselves we needed to validate that people were having difficulties moving money internationally and that we could create a sustainable company to provide that solution what is interesting is that our core area of business is in something we didn’t expect education payments we were expanding the use cases for our product as we’re trying to uncover different ways to apply our solution we have a sort of laboratory function where we do a lot of experimentation right now ryan has been driving the established product lines focused on the stuff we’ve proved to work i’m on the other side figuring out what will be valuable or not but uncovering new learnings and then driving through ideas ryan what’s funny is i came from a yearold technology company that was relatively stagnant with innovation they wouldn’t want to invest in an idea if they didn’t know it that it was going to result in a lot of revenue but how would we know that yet without actually getting something going and learning along the way so it was a lot of fun to start working with jason where we can experiment where we are as a business one of the smartest investments we can make is drawing a line between what is known that works and what we don’t know we can cause a lot of disruption by experimenting in the realm of what we don’t know c todd can you explain what flywire does jason most people were using their local banks to send money to another country almost entirely those payments were sent by international bank wires they’re very expensive when you take fees and foreign exchange markups in the cost for example if you live in spain and you want to attend mit you would end up paying an additional  because of transfer fees we process payments for  countries and territories under the traditional model while the money disappears from your account right away there’s a delay for mit to recognize the payment two weeks after you send the payment mit can finally credit your account our intention was to provide a solution to improve the experience on the payer’s side and streamline the process on the recipient’s side we partner with the world’s biggest billers universities colleges hospitals and businesses that are trying to receive funds from any country we localize the experience of the payers instead of a student or parent in china having to visit their bank for a transfer they can use their unionpay wechat pay or alipay for example c todd so this isn’t to transfer  to my friends in spain for dinner this is for bigger ticket spends jason exactly a number of companies help with small balance transfers our goal was to help streamline on the receiver side these big billers have challenges with traditional bank transfers like money showing up and all the fees were missing so the balance was short of the actual bill or they didn’t know who the payment belonged to because the message was lost in the transfer c todd what are some of the challenges that keep you up at night ryan the nature of running an international payments company is stressful regulations currency fluctuation and all the fun stuff that comes with it are all involved we have teams all dedicated to those aspects of the business thinking about products specifically wondering if we’re growing fast enough is one of the big concerns i also think about if we’re learning fast enough not just from what we’re releasing but with getting better from a process perspective c todd is there any specific thing around process that you’re looking at and trying to solve right now jason i’m quick to say that running a very small efficient team is one of the easiest things you can do the question is how you scale that up ryan how can i forget scaling c todd scale breaks everything jason exactly ryan which is good i mean it’s actually okay if it breaks it you’ve just got to learn and iterate on it fast enough jason what’s the expression that growth brings complexity and complexity kills growth c todd how do you work with the broader team like marketing and sales how do you ship products out the door ryan my team consists of product management design and product marketing functions when it is needed we need to make sure that all of those people are informed and aligned as to what’s going on if we look to the experimental lab side of the business analytics actually sits there so much of the decisionmaking for the future is datadriven jason just to elaborate the analytics team is actually embedded within each of those teams we pretty much follow the spotify model autonomous squads that consist of a product lead an engineering lead additional engineers and a design lead where it makes sense some of the internal payment processing doesn’t have much of a design need each squad is given a mission the mission starts with guardrails and guidance from people from all levels and functions of the company these people could be on the global payments team or marketing or sales they’re pulled into the conversations but are not embedded within the squads themselves we want to tap into their brains while also letting them know what’s being worked on squads are pretty autonomous and use their best judgement to get stuff out the door the makeup of each squad takes into account the mission it’s a very scalable approach with this model we’re poised to commit to investing in an idea that works to become a permanent part of the company that idea would then transition from my side of the business to ryan’s c todd could you describe the spotify model you referenced in terms of your squad jason sure we haven’t had enough people to get into the tribe and alliance guilds like spotify we’ll keep an eye on our squads to see if we can flesh it out further the concept is people from different functions who work on wildly different things coming together as a crossfunctional team the program here is called fly stronger which is the ability for anyone to raise their hand and express interest in something if there are enough people interested the company will provide money time and space to explore that idea we’re a global company which leads to interesting challenges we do an allcompany gathering somewhere around the world and it gives tremendous opportunities for people to travel it gives us the experience of learning about a different culture where we might struggle to pay for something and understand how currency may be different ryan it’s cool one of our product guys who’s based in singapore does a lot of work in china last week on his own he planned a trip to china and vowed not use any cash to see how far he could get he only ran into one challenge with a taxi but that was about it jason the way i framed it is – this is an international payments company i’m the least international person here so if the ideas that we are going to pursue are limited by what’s in my head we’re definitely going to fail every single person on the development team has lived studied and traveled immensely we incorporate the collective experiences of all the people who work here into our product we support the ability for people to get out of their comfort zone in a whole bunch of different ways and that feeds back into us making better product decisions so i think the travel aspect of our jobs is immensely important we’re really fortunate to have gotten to this stage of the company where we can give people those opportunities at the same time it feeds the product and yields a ton of return for us c todd what problems are product people not talking enough about what’s missing from the conversation ryan people are definitely talking about how to hire a product manager you can find many conversations about whether you should hire an internal person and train them or hire a seasoned product manager externally what i don’t see is enough talk about the personality traits you need to do the job it’s not always about experience i don’t necessarily look for people with  plus years of experience in product in some ways that experience takes you back to a very old way of doing things neglecting more modern approaches we need to stress the ability for people to break down a problem also everyone does product a bit differently there are some consistencies but as a whole we need to see that person has the ability to influence without authority which is a key piece of product roles assessing that ability is hard when you need to see if they fit with the culture that they love to learn they’re curious can problem solve and so on all of those pieces are part skillbased but also behavioral c todd what are some products that you really admire jason i’ll say within the payment space i think stripe has done a great job they’ve continuously added more functionality almost as though from the beginning they knew these functions would be coming everything is seamlessly integrated then with the expansion into atlas i love the way that they’ve seamlessly stretched that into a legal aspect and a global presence and a whole bunch of things which i think are probably anything beyond what their original focus was ryan i’m going to put my own personal consumer hat on – if i can pick a product that saves me and solves the problem for me every day – it’s waze i commute into the city from the north shore route  is a blast but there’s a lot of ways around it so i don’t start my car without lighting up waze to get to work c todd what advice would you offer anyone who is new to product ryan put a focus on understanding your customer and the problem get out of the building and spend some time in the world i always use jane goodall as my analogy she didn’t read books she didn’t “study” she lived in the jungle to understand chimpanzees even if the problem is on the outskirts of our product you don’t know the exact customer problems you can solve until you’re actually in their environment jason regardless of the size of the company you work for small or big whether you like it or not you are at war i love the concept of insurgency and guerilla tactics and at the end of the day clawing scratching kicking and finding a way to be able to uncover new learning and to do it better and faster than anybody else a few years ago someone asked me since we didn’t have any patents what would stop someone else from doing the same thing we did my only response was that if they could understand the customer their pain points and build something that is better than our product then they deserved the business interview notes follow jason on twitter and connect with him on linkedin connect with

what i don’t see is enough talk about the personality traits you need to do the job it’s not always about experience i don’t necessarily look for people with  plus years of experience in product in some ways that experience takes you back to a very old way of doing things neglecting more modern approaches we need to stress the ability for people to break down a problem also everyone does product a bit differently there are some consistencies but as a whole we need to see that person has the ability to influence without authority which is a key piece of product roles assessing that ability is hard when you need to see if they fit with the culture that they love to learn they’re curious can problem solve and so on all of those pieces are part skillbased but also behavioral c todd what are some products that you really admire jason i’ll say within the payment space i think stripe has done a great job they’ve continuously added more functionality almost as though from the beginning they knew these functions would be coming everything is seamlessly integrated then with the expansion into atlas i love the way that they’ve seamlessly stretched that into a legal aspect and a global presence and a whole bunch of things which i think are probably anything beyond what their original focus was ryan i’m going to put my own personal consumer hat on – if i can pick a product that saves me and solves the problem for me every day – it’s waze i commute into the city from the north shore route  is a blast but there’s a lot of ways around it so i don’t start my car without lighting up waze to get to work c todd what advice would you offer anyone who is new to product ryan put a focus on understanding your customer and the problem get out of the building and spend some time in the world i always use jane goodall as my analogy she didn’t read books she didn’t “study” she lived in the jungle to understand chimpanzees even if the problem is on the outskirts of our product you don’t know the exact customer problems you can solve until you’re actually in their environment jason regardless of the size of the company you work for small or big whether you like it or not you are at war i love the concept of insurgency and guerilla tactics and at the end of the day clawing scratching kicking and finding a way to be able to uncover new learning and to do it better and faster than anybody else a few years ago someone asked me since we didn’t have any patents what would stop someone else from doing the same thing we did my only response was that if they could understand the customer their pain points and build something that is better than our product then they deserved the business interview notes follow jason on twitter and connect with him on linkedin connect with

togetherbyrichard stop  revieweron june  format amazon videoverified purchasestupid funny irreverent comedy that is totally saved by the chemistry between bateman and reynolds ryan reynolds is by far at his best in comedies even deadpool was more of a comedy than a superhero flick and thats what pulled it off for me this one has been done many times before so there is nothing new two buddies one a straight laced father with a law career the other an arrested development man child with commitment issues hook up for a night of glory days boozing and the hijinx ensue from there a fate full stop at a fountain causes them to switch bodies and forces them to live each others lives for the next week the real fun is watching these two comic masterminds slide into the dueling roles although highly predictable it is fun to watch as bateman plays his toned down father character who unfolds in his new body and reynolds going over the top as the clueless friend who now has to take on all the responsibilities what will happen will they grow as people and come to a mutual understanding of each other who cares its ridiculous and dumb but watching the scenes when these two interact together are hysterical and laugh out loud park your brain and waste an hour and a half on this oneread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsmiddle age was never this funnybyd robertsvine voiceon june  format dvdverified purchaseif ever there were an introspective romantic comedy about the proverbial midlife crisis then this one is it mitch ryan reynolds and dave jason bateman are  friends who live antipodal lives dave is married with  children his life is structured and he is well compensated as a lawyer for a major firm mitch on the other hand is single freewheeling independent but has little  as he has difficulties finding steady employment he wants to be an actor but cant score anything higher than commercials  softcore porn flicks dave  mitch want what the other has dave envies mitchs autonomy to do whatever he pleases while mitch covets the stability of daves lifeone day when they announce their wish simultaneously to a magic fountain they trade places mitch gets to live like dave and dave gets to live like mitch they both find out that the other persons life is not so neat  tidy  easy as they assumed it would be one thing that is clear is that the situations are ripe for a great many laughsthe primary reason i bought this film was the inclusion of olivia wilde after seeing her in the recent tron movie i was hooked she does not disappoint as the sultry sabrina dave has always had an infatuation for her but hes married howeverwhat about if he dates her as mitch does that count as adulterygiven that hes no longer the same person hmmmmwhat is not in dispute is that for myself im wilde about olvia i am presently bingewatching her moviesif you want a different kind of romantic comedy one that actually includes a married couple whoa  is on the raunchy side then this flick might be just for you while i am not huge on bathroom humor i will say this flick had the funniest bh ive ever seen  they didnt overdo it if youre a middle aged fellow like myself then you will find this romp particularly poignantread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starschangeupbyrather be at the beachtop  revieweron june  format dvdverified purchasethis one comes with a warningtotally totally inappropriate i am shocked that i like it this is as risque as it gets for me and i will still like a movie jason bateman and ryan reynolds are awesomely funny and their characters are so wellwritten this movie has been done before two people change into each others bodies accidentally there are lots of outrageously funny situations because of this and then they change back but rarely has it been done so well this is pretty vulgar but is done so exceedingly well that i have watched it a number of times with my  year old son jason bateman is dave a married conservative successful lawyer with twin babies who is trying for a partnership in his firm ryan reynolds is mitch an immature dolt of a wanna be actor whose main goal in life is bedding every woman he can sleeping til noon and having fun one night they pee in a fountain and wake up the next morning in each others bodies i cant begin to explain the clever situations the writers thought of to exploit every bit of humor from this this movie is full of surprises and laughs gotta love both of those right the supporting actors are wonderful too i recommend this movieread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa great cast in a great funny moviebymike tripolion july  format amazon videoverified purchasein the genre of trading bodies movies this one stands out ryan reynolds and jason bateman are both very funny and as silly as it is manage to make one believe they have actually traded places in one scene in which ryan reynolds character is in bed with his best friends wife the acting is done well enough that you feel the embarrassment for reynolds character coming through the hallmark of good acting is when the viewer can empathize with the charactersof course lets not forget about the women in this movie leslie mann and olivia wilde leslie mann is in my opinion a brilliant actress in these types of roles she was great in knocked up and big daddy hooters girl olivia wilde always does a great job portraying the serious professional office worker with a secret  a tiny slip of a tattoo to let you now shes not all businesslastly the writer for the twin babies should have received an award for these two the

brothers boards the board was superbly wrapped and was delivered on time and in perfect condition the board is an heirloom quality board which has fantastic tracking ability great speed high quality components and great stability i have been paddleboarding for about a year and as a beginner i have built up so much confidence with a quality board such as this one i would recommend any three brothers product pros i have to mention how pleased i am with the level of customer service given to me by the folks at three brothers i am a very loyal customer when i am treated like i matter the folks at three brothers go out of their way to accommodate the customer for me that included answering the phone and spending time talking to me about which board to buy i live in va and have no way to access a distributor near by i fell in love with the board and then the company the board itself is made with very high quality materials it is beautiful and will last forever if you care for it the   fin set up really allows for great tracking i like the fact that it is a small family owned company that translates into good customized service and a quality product that they stand behind cons nothing usage i use the board on flat water lake for touring yoga and fishing the board is nice and big so it is really stable and that allows for universal use no matter what you plan on doing on the water take your dog take your radio take your cooler the bungies at the top will hold all your gear i think this is the best looking board made i get comments… submitted by anonymous on  i think this is the best looking board made i get comments and complements every time someone sees the board i had never paddled before and first time i got on it went for  hours with no problems and enjoyed every minute pros its beautiful light weight easy to manage and so much fun cons have not found anything that i dont like usage exercise relaxation  family fun   about advertise legal privacy contact
