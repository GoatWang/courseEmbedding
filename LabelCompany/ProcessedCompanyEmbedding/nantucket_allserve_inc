incorporated  employees  sales   million  estsics   bottled and canned soft drinks  carbonated waters a startup company of the s nantucket allserve inc was one of the fastestgrowing entries among the “new age” fruitflavored alternatives to traditional soft drinks this hotly competitive market was led by snapple which sold an estimated  million cases in  compared to an estimated  million for nantucket allserve fruit beverages accounted in  for  billion of the  billion beverage industry which was selling an average of  bottled drinks to each american each day struggling for a toehold  the “real world” held no allure for tom scott and tom first when they were attending brown university “in our senior year all our friends were interviewing for jobs at big new york firms” first told judy temes in the boston globe instead after graduation in  the two headed for nantucket the island off cape cod where they had both vacationed as children first and scott had spent the previous summer on the island operating “allserve” a motorboat that became a floating convenience store after scott swapped it with his father in exchange for his car the two toms delivered food beer ice cigarettes newspapers and laundry to yachts in the harbor— and even performed services like pumping out bilge tanks they also converted an icehouse in the harbor into a general store reality set in during the bleak winter months on the island first and scott worked odd jobs and cast around for some other way to stay solvent for a cooking contest first tried to recreate a peach drink he had sampled in spain after his potion of peaches sugar and water mixed in a blender won a prize the two decided to make the drink the nucleus of a new business “i remember thinking it could be a big thing” scott said “but to us big might mean ” at first first and scott sold peach nectar by the glass off the deck of allserve the response was so enthusiastic that within weeks they began pouring it into recycled wine bottles they ordered from a catalogue at  cents each capping the bottles with a hand press they bought for  they sold  bottles at  each all over the island business was so good the two invested their combined savings of  to have  cases of the nectar professionally pasteurized and bottled in new york before the summer was out they were selling the drink on the neighboring island of martha’s vineyard and parts of cape cod as well as nantucket during the last months of  first and scott introduced three flavors peachorange their best seller lemonade and cranberrygrapefruit the young entrepreneurs took in an impressive  in their first year of business at this point in their enterprise first and scott began receiving an education in hardball economics a philadelphia juice man who had helped them develop new blends and arrange for bottling cut them loose charging them with trying to muscle in on his own territory without this contact the only bottler they could interest in the juice was not equipped to handle the heated liquid needed for pasteurization “we had bottles exploding on us we had caps blowing off we had bottles freezing in the winter” scott recalled moreover some of nantucket nectars’ distributors proved treacherous stashing the bottles in nooks and crannies where they could not threaten the competition all the money the partners had grossed as well as their own savings and family loans had been sunk into production and distribution scott was so strapped for money that he spent the summer of  sleeping in his car “and even when we lived in homes we never turned on the electricity” said first “we burned our pallets in a wood stove to keep warm” in the course of their struggles the two toms took odd jobs like waiting on tables shucking scallops and shampooing dogs “we were naive and we didn’t know it” scott recalled “we just refused to quit and refusing to quit can get you through a lot” nantucket nectars’ fortunes began to turn around when an ohio bottler agreed to spend  to equip his plant to handle a ounce bottle for the drinks during  scott and first began distributing their product in washington dc landing accounts in museums and colleges and even in congress revenues climbed from about  in  to about  in  even so the two were having trouble keeping their heads above water a few of their employees who had gone unpaid all year stole more than  in merchandise from a bostonarea warehouse before the two noticed that something was amiss “we often wondered if we could go on at all” scott told temes “we lived like vagabonds” going big time  to keep the business running scott and first needed a backer whom they found while cleaning his yacht in the person of michael egan the owner of alamo rent a car egan received about  unsolicited proposals per year and had never made an investment outside his industry but he put down  for a halfinterest in the fledgling juice company now dubbed “nantucket allserve” “i was more fascinated by them than the product” egan told temes in  “i’ve never seen two young guys who’ve sacrificed more to get a business going even today they live on peanuts” interviewed in  by julia flaherty for the new york times egan confirmed that he had invested in the entrepreneurs rather than in their business “the juice wasn’t actually too good” he said “they had some flavors that were horrible they had this bayberry tea that had to be about the worsttasting snakeoil elixir you could find and put in a bottle” with the cash from egan nantucket allserve was ready to go big time scott and first added new flavors and improved the taste of their offerings by using moreexpensive cane sugar instead of the industrystandard corn syrup as a sweetener for the company’s fruit cocktails by the end of  there were  different nantucket nectars most of them alljuice drinks after bottling the product was shipped to the company’s leased warehouses in boston and washington ten thousand cases were sent to about  stores in  states each month in the boston area nantucket allserve was delivering and selling  cases a week revenues reached about  million that year a boston upscale cafe said the company’s juices were “selling themselves” but scott and first found that to move more product they had to hire salespeople to convince more retailers to stock the nantucket nectars the two also sought to raise consumer demand by formulating and airing radio spots one slogan also printed on the bottle labels along with a nantucket seascape declared “we’re juice guys we don’t wear ties to work” this slogan was more successful than the followup “we knew you’d be back” which turned off listeners by its arrogance in an ongoing publicity campaign scott and first sent purple winnebagos around the country—seven were in operation in—to distribute free samples of the purplecapped product the company also set up purple tents at football games and street fairs near the many college campuses of the boston area and sold tshirts sporting the nantucket nectars logo community activities became another form of promotion nantucket nectars cosponsored “hoops for the hungry” a dc basketball tournament the company also sponsored the  aids walk in san francisco took part in the annual earth day observance in boston and new york city and organized an annual party in boston to provide warm clothing for the homeless during  nantucket allserve’s revenues surged to  million but its founders failed to turn a profit adding more than  new employees to the base staff of seven was one reason but more important was the discovery that forging a distribution system amounted to an unacceptably expensive form of onthejob training scott and first had expanded their network to five warehouses and  trucks hired a sales force and begun distributing other beverages including arizona iced teas and clearly canadian sparkling water but the system’s volume still was too small and after the company sustained a  million loss in  nantucket allserve dropped the distribution operation and turned to outside services this reduced the average cost for delivering a case to retailers from  to  doubledigit revenues  nantucket allserve earned its first profit in  an estimated  on revenues of some  million then in  sales doubled to an estimated  million and profit before taxes rose to  that year nantucket allserve was ranked by inc as the nthfastestgrowing private company in the united states revenue was projected to double once again in  to  million in september  the company made its first nantucket nectars shipment to the coffeebar chain starbucks which was planning to sell the drinks in about  of its east coast outlets the product was available at this point in more than  states mainly on the east and west coasts and canada france great britain south korea and central and south america nantucket nectars products in  ranged from  percent fruit juice iced tea and lemonade to “juice cocktails” with only about  percent juice at a time when some competitors were marketing drinks with as little as one percent juice among nantucket’s offerings were pineapple orange banana  juice which was sweetened with white grape juice and kiwi berry juice cocktail which was  percent juice and contained water and cane sugar as well as pear kiwi and passion fruit juices mixed flavors included apple raspberry pineapple orange banana pineapple orange guava watermelon strawberry and half  half iced tea and lemonade container sizes ranged from  to  ounces but the midsized ounce bottle was the best seller of the three the company introduced a new line called nantucket super nectars in july  these six concoctions were meant to appeal to healthconscious consumers by mixing herbs like ginseng and wheat grass with fruit juices “green angel” combined herbs like echinacea with white grapes bananas and juices “chi’i green tea” was a teaandginseng mix “protein smoothie” a soyprotein drink and “gingko mango” a blend of ginkgo herb and orange and mango juices “vitalc” was a fruit juice made from the vitamincrich acerola berry “red guaranta tea” was an herbal tea made with white clover honey cranberry juice and guaraná nut berry—a plant native to the amazon with properties similar to caffeine these specialty juices retailed at a recommended price of  compared to  for the
