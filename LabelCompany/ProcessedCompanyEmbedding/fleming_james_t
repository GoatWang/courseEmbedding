et  updated apr   writers james bond and the perils of product placement by david gaughran for indiereadercom it’s one of the most recognizable quotes in the history of cinema “shaken but not stirred” the phrase perfectly encapsulated the nature of james bond and has since become synonymous with the suave british spy its first appearance was in ian fleming’s fourth bond novel diamonds are forever although bond himself didn’t utter the words until the sixth outing dr no – halfway through the muchloved series the movie franchise did a lot more to immortalize the phrase and it appeared from the very first installment dr no and in virtually every bond movie since with some notable exceptions it’s symbolic of james bond’s quintessential characteristics – sophistication – which explains why fans have reacted so angrily to reports that he will be trading his martini for a heineken in the upcoming skyfall this isn’t the first time that bond’s traditions have been tampered with his usual aston martin was swapped for a bmw in goldeneye presumably for a large check which caused a similar backlash critics argue that throughout the fleming novels numerous novelizations by other authors and twentytwo movies to date that have featured the spy there are only a few remaining signifiers that make bond who he is his code number  his looks and taste for amorous adventures and his sophistication and sense of style – of which the martini with its explicit instructions for preparation is a key part i’m sure the anger is compounded by the replacement beverage being something as unsophisticated as beer and something as universal and generic as heineken and i’m also confident that nobody is surprised to hear the release of the movie will be accompanied by a worldwide advertising campaign from heineken featuring bond swilling their lager aside from the muchderided temporary switch to bmw this is hardly the first instance of product or brand placement in bond movies since the very first installment in  bond movies have featured british airways panam perrier finlandia vodka smirnoff ford omega mattel calvin klein virgin atlantic revlon samsonite sony ericcson kodak and many more i’m sure ian fleming’s literary estate would defend the practice as monetizing something that was native to fleming’s writing anyway he often mentioned brands like cartier and received no compensation however fans would be justified in arguing that mentions of products have become increasingly shameless with a scene in casino royale namedropping omega attracting particular scorn product placement in movies and television has become so ubiquitous that it has led to widespread parody faux product placement the invention of fictional productsbrands such as kwikemart in the simpsons reverse placement the rebranding of reallife  stores as kwikemarts in  and product displacement where mercedezbenz asked the makers of slumdog millionaire to remove their iconic logo from scenes featuring their cars in slum settings such product placement isn’t as common in books but it has a long history when jules verne began serializing around the wold in eighty days in  transport and shipping companies lobbied to be mentioned it should be noted that verne claimed the novel was inspired by a thomas cook advertisement in a parisian newspaper however without a doubt the most shameless literary product placement was in a pulpy detective novel from  called never kill a client by brett halliday the book was part of a longrunning and hugely popular series featuring private detective mike shayne in one early scene in never kill a client shayne is on the scent of a case and boards a flight to los angeles taking a seat next to a passenger reading another of brett halliday’s books the narrator goes on to say “it wasn’t a rare occurrence for shayne to see some complete stranger reading one of halliday’s books with thirty million copies of them sold in soft cover editions it would have been queerer if you didn’t run into them now and then and shayne also knew that she woke to darkness had recently been reissued in a new cover and there were probably several hundred thousand copies of it in the hands of readers throughout the country” the conversation between shayne and the passenger about halliday’s oeuvre continues for another two pages such an aside is probably made easier by the fact that brett halliday was a penname the writer davis dresser was an interesting character who wore an eyepatch since a childhood accident with barbed wire aside from a voluminous writing output he was also a founding member of the mystery writers of america of which his wife fellow author helen mccloy later became the first female president there is no doubt that dresser’s tongue is firmly planted in his cheek in the above as fun is poked at several of his novels however it quite clearly shows the possibilities for advertisers to shoehorn their way into fictional narratives the advent of ebooks makes such marketing tieins a lot more attractive to brands as any author who has been interviewed for a newspaper will know a clickable link can make all the difference between a bump in sales and no effect whatsoever publishers and selfpublishers have been circling the idea of advertising in ebooks for some time straight advertising can be intrusive and can also provoke a negative reaction even if advertising in books is nothing new and has long been common in things like travel guides product placement is usually more subtle and allows marketers to tap into the emotional connection that people have with the writer’s characters the attraction of the idea is obvious it’s an additional revenue stream and potentially a very lucrative one while product placement in novels is unlikely to attract the kind of prices we are seeing in movies skyfall is aiming to bring in over m in product placement fees there is no doubt that the biggest selling books could command considerable prices for selfpublishers the attraction lies in monetizing free or cheap content after all a book could be permanently free if it was subsidized sufficiently by advertising or product placement fees however as the james bond outcry shows there are clear dangers here it seems there is a small step between getting paid for something you are doing anyway

reviews  out of  starsshort but successful attempt to explore where flemings world ended and bonds began by nicholas j r dougan vine voice on  jun format hardcover a book written to accompany an exhibition at the imperial war museum to celebrate the centenary of ian flemings birth it is according to author ben macintyre neither a biography of ian fleming nor a biography of james bond but a personal investigation into the intersection of two lives one real and one fictionalthere certainly are many elements of a biography of fleming we learn of his fathers death when he was just nine on the western front and of his relationship with his domineering mother evelyn referred to by him and his brothers interestingly as m flemings search for a career that combined high earnings with a relaxed lifestyle his compulsive womanising his taste for the good things of life but also his war service in naval intelligence are all covered as a backdrop to the elements of bonds character the many actual people who may have contributed to bond as well as fleming including his late father valentine fleming his brother peter also involved in intelligence work a variety of commandos and special forces types like fitzroy maclean and a similar treatment to the other principal characters in the books like m and miss moneypenny the way that fleming adopted names from acquaintances for other characters is fascinating he was almost sued by the architect erno goldfinger for the misappropriation of his onewhile macintyre comments primarily on the books he also brings in the films i suspect that part of the reason for this was that it gave the book and the exhibition much more material to display but on the whole inclusion of film material is not intrusive and allows macintyre to point out the differencesread more › comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please

format paperback interesting for only those who havent read the numerous fleming autobiographies andor bond books where the contents of this book are covered in much more detailits a slim volume and only really of interest to those just wanting the most basic of details about the bond booksfilms and ian flemingmust agree with the  star reviewer about the cover note it states that this is a biography of both bond and fleming however the author states in his first paragraph that this book is neither  bit naughty of the publishersan interesting read but i found nothing new about either fleming or bond and i suspect that most people with the most basic knowledge of either subject will be in the same positionlots of perphaps and maybes very slim on actual factsa decent starting point but nothing more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please try again report abuse  out of  starshighly readable by mr r d m kirby on  july format paperback andrew lycett and john pearson have both written very creditable biographies of ian fleming as well as a number of other authors on the same subject who have failed to come anywhere near but in this book the highly talented ben macintyre has carried out his research very well indeed he draws together the life of fleming the origins of bond and shows the comparisons between the drabness of postwar england and the life lived by bond with his exotic meals fabulous locations exciting lifestyle and the top totty whom he encountered with bewildering regularity with flemings racy authoritative style of writing it was inescapable that the bond books would become bestsellersthe author is a fan of bond and his creator as i am mr macintyre possesses a writing style which is both fluid and witty i found this book informative amusing and irresistible comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes

july format hardcover as one who studied flemings work extensively as a graduate student and later publishing a thesis on the writers impact on pop culture of the period i must admit i was a bit skeptical about yet another bland and redundant bond coffee table book for the masses happily this is not the case with for your eyes only ian fleming and james bond by ben macintyre written on the centenary of the authors birth highly readable and enjoyable and chock full with fullcolor photos of props used throughout all  bond films this book is a comprehensive survey of not just of bonds impact on fiction and the cinema but a real indepth analysis of the man who breathed live into one of popular cultures most endurable iconsmuch is written about flemings childhood adolescence education at eton relationships with family brother peter noted travel writer his military career his closest friends ivar bryce and noel coward his lovehate relationships with wife ann and the authors affairs with numerous beautiful women which oddly resemble flemings fictional alterego for those who wish to learn more about bond and the writer who created him this tome is a great springboard into the bond phenomenon which has spanned over forty years comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we

life of ian fleming to his famous fictional creation macintyre does an excellent job of summarizing the life of fleming and the inspirations both in his personality and in his experience that led to the famous mythical world of as you would expect of an imperial war museum production there are excellent photos from the archives as well as artifacts from the james bond movies comment  people found
