prweb on your site mission wealth management llc reveals hidden trading costs to clients share article local santa barbara wealth management agency firm httpwwwmissionwealthcom discusses hidden trading costs for bonds mission wealth management llc logo fees are a part of investing and they should be transparent so the client can make informed decisions seth street president  cofounder of mission wealth management llc santa barbara ca prweb july   mission wealth management llc shows hidden fees in bond yields and reveals what some brokers may not be telling investors client advisors financial planners and risk managers at mission wealth management llc routinely meet clients who have bonds held with brokerage firms where they believe they are getting a “deal” at a certain visible cost per trade what brokers oftentimes omit are the spreads being built into the purchase or sale of the bond especially at large and traditional wirehouse firms the firm and their brokers get a portion of the commission brokers are not required to disclose the commission or the markup they charge their clients these undisclosed commissions may equate to tens of thousands of dollars over a span of years in client accounts with a high amount of bond activity oftentimes brokers and firms mark up the cost of a bond by two or three dollars per bond when the actual cost to transact a bond can be as low as five to ten cents what may seem like a small commission rate at two to three dollars per bond can quickly add up when buying hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonds this markup can quickly add up to hidden commissions to the broker and the firm at a cost to the investor “of the hundreds of clients that come through the mission wealth doors few if any knew they were being charged these commissions” said seth streeter president and cofounder of mission wealth management llc “fees are a part of investing and they should be transparent so the client can make informed decisions” bond transactions are required by law to be posted for public viewing professionals can easily sift through the data but for investors figuring out the undisclosed commissions through settlement tracking websites is not necessarily easy this may be the reason why this practice is so prevalent about mission wealth management llc mission wealth management llc was founded on a vision to empower

introduces new formula for retirement strategy geared for success share article local santa barbara wealth management firm httpwwwmissionwealthcom shares simple retirement planning formula make sure you are on track for retirement with mission wealth managements  rule our mission is to help our clients create a personalized retirement plan so that they can enjoy their golden years santa barbara ca prweb august   mission wealth management makes planning for retirement an easy endeavor with their tried and tested  rule to help people realize how close they are to retirement to know if individuals are on track for retirement mission wealth management’s cofounders brad stark and seth streeter devised a simple formula called the  rule that is easy to use and understand “our mission is to help our clients create a personalized retirement plan so that they can enjoy their golden years yet so many individuals who are near retirement question whether or not they’re on track” said stark “the  rule is a great tool to calculate retirement preparedness” the  rule is a formulaic tool to help determine an individual’s level of retirement preparedness in three easy steps  step one income gap determine all expenses and all anticipated income sources social security rental property income interest dividends pensions etc when heading into retirement we typically find the most financially secure people have  percent or more of their expenses covered by anticipated income conversely people become less likely to achieve their financial goals when their anticipated income covers less than  percent of their expenses once an individual’s income gap has been determined the next step in retirement preparedness comes down to their portfolio mix their goals and a functional timeline          step two income generation when trying to create the desired income it may take  percent or less of an individual’s investment portfolio to cover their expenses via “income” investments remember this portion of the portfolio is designed to address shortterm needs if it takes more than  percent to cover expenses chances are they do not have enough “growth” assets set aside to help guard against inflation and the rising costs they will most likely incur in retirement  step three inflation growth what is not used for income purposes is money that can be allocated toward the future with people living longer into retirement guarding against inflation is also important depending on an individual’s age and health entering into retirement we generally recommend that at least  percent of an individual’s portfolio be dedicated to growth investments so that they can keep pace with rising costs the longer an individual’s expected retirement the more that can be allocated to growth and vice versa for shorter horizons two typical outcomes can come from this formula individuals have either saved “too much” or “too little” for individuals who have saved “too little” they may need to assume more investment risk and an increased financial uncertainty that comes with it to fill the gap individuals can also however look to cut expenses work longer or modify goals for those who have saved “too much” they should not become greedy with investments but consider taking on the least amount of risk to accomplish their needs although this rule is not a substitution for financial planning it does serve as a tool to help people take a quick look at their finances to get a visual understanding of how this works please review our infographic about mission wealth management llc mission wealth
