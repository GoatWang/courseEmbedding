advisor is right for me choosing to work with a feeonly advisor allows you to receive unbiased financial advice while also benefiting from a fiduciary standard of care – the industry’s highest standard of care unbiased advice in one way or another there is always a cost for financial advice either through the direct payment to the advisor or indirect payment via commissions paid when investment products ex stocks bonds mutual funds annuities are bought or sold the three most common payment arrangements for financial advisors are feeonly feebased and commissionbased feeonly advisors like foster  motley only receive compensation from fees paid by clients for financial and investment advice feebased advisors receive some of their compensation from fees paid by client but they also receive commissions on product sales commissionbased advisors like traditional stock brokers or insurance agents receive all of their compensation from commissions on product sales as a fee only advisor our advice is free from the conflict of interest inherent when recommendations are made on products that the advisor is being paid to sell our recommendations are strictly based on what we believe is in your best interest and not on products that may pay the most generous commissions fiduciary standard of care as a registered investment advisor ria foster  motley is held to a fiduciary standard that means by law we must act solely in your best interest we must provide upfront disclosures about our qualifications how we are compensated possible conflicts of interest and any history of disciplinary action as a fiduciary we are required to always place your interests ahead of our own most brokers and other salespeople are not fiduciaries they are only required to consider whether an investment is suitable to be recommended and not whether the investment best fits your unique financial goals and circumstances when selecting and working with professional advisors carefully review how and from whom advisors receive their compensation to ensure your best interests are always placed first at foster  motley it’s our duty to work with you to create a customized plan uniquely tailored to your situation we believe the fiduciary standard of care is best for clients and we have structured our business around this principal as an independent feeonly employeeowned

hiring click to view current opportunity current clients they especially enjoy the income focus of our investment strategy and take great comfort seeing the income produced from their portfolio arrive in their checking account on a monthly basis steve  janet a recent procter  gamble retiree needing to turn savings into cash flow he signed his separation agreement now what steve  has worked at pg for  years with the support of his wife janet he recently accepted a separation package to retire from pg the thought of retirement has raised a number of questions including where will cash flow come from in retirement how can he optimize aftertax cash flow from various income sources such as interest dividends stock options and selfemployment is the life insurance policy purchased when their children were young still needed how can he leverage the maximum aftertax benefit from the profit sharing trust how much pg stock is too much and how can this risk be reduced in a taxefficient manner  how can he maximize the tax benefits of their charitable goals steve and janets background steve and janet have grown children who are beginning their own careers janet has not worked outside the home to date their finances have been relatively simply steve’s cash flow covered their expenses they saved for retirement in a k built a cash reserve and watched pg’s contributions to the profit sharing trust grow over time how did foster  motley help we began by listening listening to their vision for retirement their attitude towards money and investing and their legacy goals once we understood steve  janet better we got to work preparing a onepage summary of their financial life a net worth statement year cash flow and tax projections we also projected their financial future using our sophisticated software the projection helped us understand the bigger picture and future risk including what if markets produce below average returns in retirement what if inflation is higher than we projected what if they spend more in retirement building this foundation opened their eyes to a number of opportunities  their “asis” tax projection revealed widely fluctuating tax brackets this year’s tax rate was high because of the pg separation package but the following year was relatively low their investment portfolio was heavily weighted to stocks combined with their concentration in pg stock they were taking significantly more market risk than they realized they were making charitable gifts using aftertax cash  they did not have a strategy for stock options “asis” their retirement cash flow would come primarily from tax deferred accounts they no longer had a need for life insurance  after identifying areas of opportunity we created several integrated solutions including the year following retirement was a low income tax year this presented a great opportunity to do a lump sum distribution from the pg profit sharing trust this distribution allowed them to generate capital gain sourced cash flow donate low basis stock to charity rather than aftertax cash generate qualified dividend income on the pg stock diversify their investment portfolio with the funds that rolled to an ira we recommended an asset allocation to reduce the risk they were taking while meeting their cash flow needs we modified their asset location to keep more of their income in their pocket after taxes they set limit orders on their pg stock options to add discipline to their option strategy they understood the tradeoffs between carrying options vs exercising early and investing in a diversified portfolio they are now saving the money previously spent on insurance premiums in their grandchildren’s college  saving plans this contribution allows them to receive a state income tax deduction while generating taxfavored savings and growth our initial flatfee planning process provided steve  janet with confidence that they are being as efficient with their wealth as possible following our initial month planning engagement we discussed the different ways we could work together going forward ultimately steve and janet selected our wealth management service they like having a dedicated financial planner and portfolio manager to integrate all components of their financial lives they especially enjoy the income focus of our investment strategy and take great comfort seeing the income produced from their portfolio arrive in their checking account on a monthly basis having this dedicated wealth management team provides steve and janet the time to enjoy the
