statements this press release contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  that are based on managements current expectations assumptions and beliefs forwardlooking statements can often be identified by words such as expect anticipate intend and similar expressions and variations or negatives of these words these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to statements regarding expected dividend rates the delivery of value and results to our residents and stockholders and nxrts guidance for financial results for the full year  they are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and anticipated sales of properties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement readers should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements and are encouraged to review the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   and the companys other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec for a more complete discussion of the risks and other factors that could affect any forwardlooking statements except as required by law nxrt does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events changing circumstances or any other reason after the date of this press release definitions and reconciliations this press release includes analysis of funds from operations or ffo adjusted funds from operations or affo and net operating income or noi all of which are nongaap financial measures of performance these nongaap measures should be used as a supplement to and not a substitute for net income loss computed in accordance with gaap for a more complete discussion of ffo affo and noi see our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our other filings with the sec this press release also includes an analysis of our same store properties which are defined as those that are stabilized and comparable for both the current and the prior reporting year same store analysis for the third quarter of  includes  properties totaling  units or approximately  of the companys  units ffo and affo we believe that net income as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure we also believe that funds from operations or ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and adjusted funds from operations or affo are important nongaap supplemental measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income as defined by gaap ffo is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges we compute ffo attributable to common stockholders in accordance with nareits definition our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income loss loss before adjusting for noncontrolling interests and show the noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at ffo attributable to common stockholders affo is calculated by adjusting our ffo by adding back items that do not reflect ongoing property operations such as acquisition expenses equitybased compensation expenses the amortization of deferred loan costs the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on our interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges prepayment penalties incurred on the early retirement of debt and the noncontrolling interests related to these items affo will also be adjusted to include any gains losses from sales of property to the extent excluded from ffo and exclude relevant noncontrolling interests we also present affo excluding the impact of sales of real estate we believe that the use of ffo and affo combined with the required gaap presentations improves the understanding of operating results of reits among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful the following table

earlier today i would now like to turn the call over to brian mitts please go ahead brian brian mitts thank you marilynn i want to welcome everybody into the nxrt first quarter  conference call i am joined here with matt mcgraner executive vice president and chief investment officer and as marilynn mentioned im brian mitts chief financial officer im going to begin with some highlights from the quarter and then discuss at a high level some of our q results then i am going to turn to over matt and let him talk about the portfolios and some in detail and some other items well come back and discuss guidance for the remainder of  and then turn it back to the operator for questions so let me get started on the highlights we feel first quarter was a pretty solid start to the year just stepping back and looking at the stock price our prices up  through yesterdays close  if you include the dividends which you think is a good performance versus peers in the index we reported gaap net loss of  million which was driven by an increase in depreciation  million over q of ’ which is primarily related to the acquisition of the houston portfolio at the end of  in the hollister place our property in february as well as an increase interest expense of  million which is also related to the debt that we use to acquire both the houston portfolio and hollister place as we mentioned in previous discussions disclosures and presentations we utilized debt to acquire those portfolios with a plan to pay those down via reverse  exchange which has begun to take place in april and then well get into that later on yearoveryear same store revenue grew  same store occupancy was up  basis points to  and same store noi grew by  we believe we continue to improve our value add thesis through dispositions and matt is go into some detail on not that here in a minute and those netted high irrs we continued strong pace of renovations with high return on equity return – sorry renovating  units in the first quarter that will return on equity at  on the leased units to date through march  we completed rehab on  units at an average cost  per unit with an average rent increase of  per month which results in a return on equity of  we made one acquisition this year which is the aforementioned hollister place and through the end of april weve sold four properties as part of the reverse  tax deferred exchange to help fund the houston portfolio acquisition we made end of ‘ we entered into a  million of interest rates swaps during the quarter bringing our total of swaps to  million subsequent to quarter and in april we entered into an additional  million interest rate swap together with the prior swaps we have now fixed at this point  im sorry as of march   were fully rate at an average rate across all of our debt at  we factor in all the various swaps thats a higher number as far as the amount of debt thats now fixed versus floating once you take into effect the pay downs that we’re making for the dispositions and the anticipated disposition in general were using the dispositions to deliver from the houston portfolio acquisitions we mentioned paying down  million in some of the short term debt that we brought on and we did that in april regatta bay properties under contract one sold will complete the  reverse exchange for the hollister place property and net proceeds will be used to further deliver for q  financial results we are reporting revenue of  million for the quarter which is up  of our q  we’re reporting net loss attributable to common shareholders of  million or  per diluted share for the quarter which included  million of depreciation and interest expense of  million we are reporting noi or net operating income of  million for the first quarter of ’ as compared to  million for the first quarter of  which represents an increase of a  we’re reporting ffo of  million or  cents per diluted share as compared to  million or  cents per diluted share for q in  we are reporting core ffo of  million or  per diluted share as compared to  million or   i am sorry  per diluted share for the first quarter of  and we’re reporting affo of  million or  per diluted share which compares to  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  our same store properties continue to produce clear results in our opinion we classified  properties as same store properties for the first quarter of  for the first quarter we increased rental income to  other income  and same store noi  quarter ending occupancy was up  basis points to  as compared to the first quarter of  and matt’s is going to go into some more detail around those numbers in his update as of march  we had total cash of  million of that  million is free cash on hand used in day to day operations to expand the dividend ongoing expenses and other corporate purposes  million of that represents of the  million represents restricted cash which includes  million of cash earmarked for capital expenditures for our value add program as of march  our total debt outstanding was  ph million and as we discussed thats come down since the end of the quarter through the dispositions we made in april we continue to take that down further once we close regatta bay as of march  our preliminary debt is now  percent and our fixed rate debt is  when you include the effect of the swaps adjusted weighted average interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness which we define as inclusive of the effect of the swaps is when you factor in the pay down in debt as well as the additional swaps that we entered into at the end of the quarter with the pay down before dispositions and the additional swaps that we entered into in q the plus regatta bay sale and the delevering that we will do with that transaction the effect was fixed  of our debt in june the second quarter  – ’ the board has declared a dividend of  per share which is the same as it was last quarter for shareholders record on june th  payable on june th as far as coverage for ffo our coverage is  one times per diluted share core ffo was  times per diluted share and  times our affo per diluted share so with that let me turn it over to matt to go through his comments brian mitts thanks brian let’s dig deeper into the value add results the same store recap and leasing activity and in some capital recycling from value add perspective as of today reflecting the four assets sold in the first quarter all the remaining  active assets have some type of rehab in progress approximately  of all budget exterior and common area dollars has been spent and approximately  of all budgeted interior dollars have been spent as we reported earlier we completed  upgrades two units for the quarter portfolio wise and since in its inception excluding the sold properties we have now upgraded  interiors or about  of the growth portfolio for an average cost per unit of  achieving approximately  our roi ended  per month increase the same sort recap as brian mentioned we reported  same store noi growth over the prior year the same store fours reached  of our properties or  units our rental revenue increased brian mentioned by  digging deeper into that number we achieved the following results as compared to the prior quarter market rent was up  on the top line we did better unloss ph the lease recording at  reduction also did better in vacancy ph the loss recording at  improvement there average rent increased to  in the same store pool from  percent or  or  percent increase other income as brian mentioned was  better year over year led by strong upfront fee which was  increase year every year at  increase and then valley trash ph program continues to help drive other income as well that was  increase for the first quarter the same store by market dallas was up  houston up  dc metro area was up  atlanta was strongest at nashville was  primarily due to real estate tax adjustments charlotte was  phoenix was  west palm beach was  orlando was  tampa at  same store effective rent by market was also as strong and continues to be robust with five markets producing  or better effect rents year over year on the leasing activity front we saw strong effective rent growth across the portfolio yearonyear same same year at new tenant for the first quarter although being slower part of the year we saw  growth in new leases some of the markets with the highest were west palm beach at  atlanta at  and dallas and orlando each pushing over  renewal growth also continue to be robust with   overall on  renewals during the quarter so  average monthly increase nashville was the highest at  during the quarter atlanta was second with  growth on renewals charlotte came in third at  and tampa and dallas rounded out up the top five with new increases each about  on the capital recycling front as we previously discussed subsequent to the quarter we saw  ph in dallas myanmar susquehanna  at the park for  million as well as one of our assets or our last asset rather in frederick maryland indiscernible for  million we generated gross proceeds from the sale of approximately a  million and yielded approximately levered irr  and a  times multiple on invested capital regatta bay remains classified as held for sale though it’s currently under contract leasehold for  million we expect that to close in early june upon the closing of regatta we will have  we will have replaced the senior bridge lines taken out to acquire the h portfolio in hollister place with permanent first mortgages in addition we will completely retired to  term disability and pay down our revolver from  million to approximately  million even though with the competition for five c assets with value upside remains robust we continue to be active in the investment in marketplace and are increasingly focused on second chance opportunities with deals that have fallen or out of contract given our cost to capital and positive liquidity profile we’ll continue to be opportunistic with a view for towards doing more of the same that’s harvesting gains redeploying the capital and high quality cover land plays with value add potential let’s spend a minute on our refinancing strategy that weve been implementing as of late and pursuing to improve the longer term earnings profile of the company given the uptick in liobor treasury market since the election we noticed some letters of reduced spreads from the levels we saw last summer for example floating rates spreads depending on leverage profile particularly in our leverage category that’s come in anywhere from  to  basis points and given this tightening and as brian mentioned we decided to enter into  million of additional swaps on previously unprotected or unhedged debt bringing our portfolio average indeed tax rate to approximately  in the coming months youll see us plan to take advantage of these title and lease spreads by refinancing this  million of previously unprotected debt while still in return and maintaining the all important prepayment flexibility and looking ahead were excited about how we’re position to take advantage of the peak demand during spring leasing season especially in our midmarket demographic as of the end of april for example our portfolio sits at  physically occupied in  leased renewal can continue to be robust in april and its currently posting a  increase new lease growth over current effective rents was  in april loan showing great signs of keeping pace with last year’s solid demand that’s all i have for prepared remark i’d l like to thank our teams nexpoint for their continued hard work and execution i’d like turn it back over to brian brian mitts thank you so before we recap and then turn over to questions let me go through our guidance we are reaffirming our  full year guidance as follows revenue low in  million high end  million for midpoint of  million net income  million on the low end  million on the high end for a midpoint of  million noi  million on the low end  million on the high end for midpoint of  million ffo per diluted share  per share in the low end  per share on high end for midpoint of   cents per diluted share core ffo on the low end  per diluted share  per diluted share on the high end for midpoint of  per diluted share and finally affo  per diluted share on low o per diluted share on the high end for midpoint of  per diluted share same basic assumptions last quarter overnight projecting any additional acquisitions or dispositions beyond what we’ve already discussed obviously as matt discussed we are engaging upon a refinancing strategy these numbers don’t necessarily reflect all that it does reflect in these swaps that we put in place and the pay downs of the debt from the  dispositions as well as the anticipated pay downs from the regatta bay disposition with that let me just give a couple of closing thoughts and kind of recap we continue to focus on our recycling of capital on a tax efficient manner and growing noi ffo and core ffo and affo per share we think that we’ve done a pretty good job of that here and as matt mentioned continue to be active looking for opportunities that fit into what were trying to do we will continue to position the balance sheet in the capital stack for the future walking in more certainty by fixing more a larger percentage of our debt and try to take advantage of some of the things we see in the marketplace theres matt not talked about we’re going to continue to use reverse  exchanges and available lines that we have from indiscernible to do acquisitions in the future to the extent necessary and from time to time you may see like this quarter where interest expense spikes up but we intend to bring that down and have a plan in place prior to making those acquisitions and just also you continue to own a lot of this company and continue to add to that position which you think obviously aligns us with shareholders we continue  we anticipate to continue to increase our holdings of this company in the future so with that let me turn it over to operator for any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from daniel donlan with ladenburg thalmann daniel donlan thank you and good morning just wanted to dig little bit into the guidance is the additional  million of interest rate swaps was that originally part of your thought process when you put out guidance was that kind of  is that that kind of potential you know head or potential plus you know kind of versus what you originally expected brian mitts yeah it was in the original guidance we put out in march so thats new for this quarter but we felt there was other changes that overall guidance was right in line with where it was before also as mentioned and matt talked about in little bit of detail it’s kind of done in conjunction with refinancing strategy to take advantage of tighter spreads so its kind of a net wash ultimately daniel donlan okay so it sounds like fundamentals are maybe better than you expected when you put it out and thats probably making it a net wash is that fair to say brian mitts yes i think that part but then also the decrease that we expect to get from refinances from the debt these swamps recovery daniel donlan okay and then the jump in same store maintenance costs you know i think of competitive years for put some of their repair and maintenance expense in the winter months we just kind of curious if that something similar was going on with you guys or is this something that we should expect to remain elevated in future quarters matt mcgraner there is two components of it one is the higher turn costs we had a higher turnover ratio in the first quarter than it’s been in the past so that was a decent component of it the other part was it  was sort of an implementation or continued expansion of some of the other income items that have to hit the arm in bucket based on our policy for example valley trash ph and rolling out valley trash theres an immediate expense taken to the rollout of the program but it’s then recaptured through the other income bucket the net effect of it is that for every dollar that we spend on valley trash and other income buckets we get about   back but it have an increase in the line item daniel donlan okay okay and then i think you talked about in the past that you might have to get some tax reductions at the houston properties and given what you paid versus what the prior owners pay we’re just kind of curious you know when you think that those benefits would hit you know and how youre progressing toward that goal matt mcgraner yes so were actively working on it its a good question and i would say its a portfolio wide question that were currently working on we think that the numbers the real estate tax numbers in our guidance and our budgets are conservative so were hoping to beat those not withstanding the municipalities robust interest in finance that being said for the houston assets specifically the h and hollister place we think that will some clarity on those by the beginning of the third quarter daniel donlan okay okay i appreciate that and then im sorry i got a little bit late this – a lot of this morning but just kind of curious if you could characterize the current acquisition environment you know it certainly seems to be pretty competitive but you know you do have a lot of capital avail to you you know whether its you know to your debt i am just kind of curious you know your general appetite for acquisitions going forward and kind of where you know where you see  if you see opportunities out there and you know is a more one off or is there any potential you know smaller portfolios you think that you can you can pick up especially given that theres been some big trades and you know oftentimes when that happens you know theres a couple of properties that may shake out that may not be viewed as core to somebody else but it could be for the years matt mcgraner yes it’s a good question we first start by saying we think that theres a robust market for demand in the middle income rider ph profile which is where we play obviously and we dont see that waiting off any time soon so we still like the market a lot and were still pursuing acquisitions or being under the  if you will in a number of opportunities but were also being patient i’d say that for smaller deals sub  million the competition is still very robust you know have   offers everyone in close sometimes you have a  that just you know those are stupid number and it beats everyone so weve seen now a lot of we’ve also around sell side and were continuing to take advantage of it but we focus mainly is the  million to  million our equity check range where you know a few folks could play especially for these types of value add assets were outside of the core fund and then were outside of the core corpus fund guys and then were you know were outside of the private regional guys as well so were focusing on that in  with our pre check range and dont have anything yet but were certainly  were certainly trying to dig up opportunities and exist daniel donlan okay okay and then just curious going back to your comments about you know the maintenance costs being elevated this quarter because of the higher turn is there any trend there that you can maybe point to maybe it was just like one or two assets but you know is it you know what do you thinks been driving you know what drove that higher turn in the first quarter relative to kind of maybe past quarters matt mcgraner i think in past quarters or with respect to that its time over q of  we have created more units and were pushing – and not pushing people out but were certainly trying to push rents at higher cliff and that end you know march was pretty much id say the big impact of that and thats typical with spring leasing season  yes march april may june is when you can see when youre going to see higher term and you should also see higher rents which you know as i said in my prepared remarks april was incredibly strong for us and we dont and we dont think thats going to stop the functioning daniel donlan okay i appreciate the color matt mcgraner thanks dan operator operator instructions well go next to ryan meliker with canaccord genuity ryan meliker hey good morning guys thanks for a lot of good color earlier and to dans questions i just want to talk a little bit more about houston you talked about the property tax dynamic that could unfold to houston will address your properties im just wondering when you think about houston specifically what are you seeing across that market do you think that fundamentals are going to start to turn positive soon in a meaningful way do you think it is just that the second derivative and the pace of deceleration is sighted and are you seeing that start to impact the valuation matt mcgraner very very good questions i wouldnt say the tale of two cities and that tells you asset are class sizes or class type so indiscernible eastern and the western portion  the western portion is still a challenge regardless of if it you know class a or b but these are stronger and then the eastern portion continues to be strong an example is our sailing in regatta bay that’s going to sell for you know assuming its starts sale out  cap rate on an t over t adjusted so thats on a nominal basis and then within sort of the you know the  i think i may have mentioned this on the first quarter call or the fourth quarter call a lot of people are focusing again on using the think that theres a bargain which is increasing the size of the transaction activity and the number of people focusing on trying to get a discount so there are no shortage of buyers in that market today at least as it pertains to classb assets i think that you know youve heard both in america say this they are focusing on the you know the lease up opportunities in classa which seems like a strong smart strategy because there are many opportunities i this year but its just not our indiscernible so to speak as far as demand you know in part of our h acquisition we think the  deliveries are still going to be probably that net neutral because were still going to be some the ’ the supply really falls off a cliff and again if you get any sort of stable stabilization and job growth there which were seeing and when well publish down on this review presentation i think the markets going to you know turn positive in the early to mid half of  ryan meliker great thats helpful and then just one other real quick one we had you know you did you gave some good color surrounding interest expense and what you guys are doing from a refinancing perspective obviously you sold some assets pay down some debt more recently as we think about you know how of the next three quarters are going to trend from an interest expense perspective you know can you give us some guidance in terms of what we should expect you know is it going to moderate and were going to be at a run rate basis comparable you know for three consecutive quarters in a row or is it going to gradually wind down based on how swaps come into play and when you when you as you execute your refinancing strategy et cetera matt mcgraner yeah i think going forward looking to this second quarter you will see a decrease based on the debt we paid down already and will continue to pay down and i think given the assumptions that were making which is no additional acquisitions or dispositions youd see kind of moderate and get on the run rate the difference would be if we did some acquisition and didnt raise the equity and did what we did with the houston halls portfolio where perhaps we use leverage to fund them and then use the sale after the fact to pay down that additional debt so you may see it jump for a quarter but they will come back down and that maybe something that happens over time that it’s a decrease in then decrease back down to a more normalized run rate ryan meliker got you that makes sense thats helpful thanks guys matt mcgraner thanks ryan operator we’ll take our next question from indiscernible with jefferies q – unidentified analyst good morning guys i just a quick question on the ma call you did hear some commentary about new supply and many of the market and i think thats one of the key reasons that took down same store revenue guidance granted you guys do not focus on the exact same type of properties but could you just talk a little bit about kind of what you were seeing in your markets and specifically what youre seeing in regards to the product type that youre targeting to supply headwind matt mcgraner yes absolutely so our two largest markets dallas and atlanta are certainly seeing supply dallas especially most of that is in the you know in the case of dallas the uptown area you have some indiscernible but the majority of it is sort of in the cbd uptown area same thing as it relates to atlanta and the perimeter in buckhead and its on the top end to the class there class a or class a  luxury and for the most part as that relates to our products you know we said in the past that you know a new developer in our markets needs you know   range for a one bedroom to get you know  stabilize yield we need   to make it  so theres still that to get into a retail rent between class a b markets and the market and the market just doesnt allow for new construction of affordable housing which is the segment that we focus on and you know late last year you know a tax credit developer in which case youre in a different demographic and area of the city in general so we think that seeing new construction in our markets is good because it just helps you know show that rent demand is there all that being said it is still very very difficult or increasingly difficult to get a construction on whereas you know a year or two ago you could get a construction loan with   equity today   so were seeing you know were seeing entirely new standards in an age waiver of wage and labor costs continue to rise and then theres less land available so all that seems to be pointing to signs of moderating supply our markets still have strong permitting data but you know eventually i think that those factors will lead to lots of fire brian mitts and its worth mentioning as far as our strategy as matt mentioned in prior question were trying to play in that  million to  million equity check range where theres less competition so if you take the supply question out of it and focus on the bidding for our assets theres not a lot of people i think who we are because of the public agree or lower cost of capital wellpositioned to compete in that area particularly in these markets q – unidentified analyst got you and another one for me could you just talk a little bit about the your indiscernible on your phoenix market where you have negative yearonyear growth rental rates is kind of whats happening with market dynamics brian mitts so dc is market that i would say it was our weakest at the frederick maryland some market was our weakest asset market and obviously with the sale of our second asset there drove it all in which we made money on a pretty decent return were out of so those were assets that say it doesnt feel anything about the you know the dc metro area in general with respect to phoenix so phoenix is again an asset specific topic one of our  two of our largest properties there colonnade in the point at foothills our larger properties that we are focusing more have focused more on our debt in the first quarter and into the fourth quarter making sure we had heads in the beds such that we can start implementing our business plan and turning units and upgrading needed on turns as they roll and then the total revenue in phoenix if you look at it just from the above net effective rents and the other income was actually up  percent in the quarter so while we were moderating to  in the door in occupancy up to stabilize those two properties that are higher in   percent cliff we did see a pretty significant outperformance in total revenue there q – unidentified analyst got you thank you very much brian mitts thank you that concludes todays questionandanswer session this time ill turn the call back to mr brian mitts for any final remarks brian mitts thank you we appreciate everyones time very good questions hopefully we got some good color out there and hope people kind of think about what’s headed here in  we look forward to i am mad seeing everyone is nareit new york and then well be back in august on q call so thank you very much operator this does conclude todays conference thank you for your participation
