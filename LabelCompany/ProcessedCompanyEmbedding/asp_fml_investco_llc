certificate of incorporation our amended and restated bylaws and delaware law some provisions of delaware law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our directors these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management it is possible that these provisions    table of contents could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares these provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us we believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because among other things negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms delaware law section  of the dgcl prohibits a delaware corporation including those whose securities are listed for trading on the nyse from engaging in any business combination as defined in section  with any interested stockholder as defined in section  for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless      the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status      upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least  of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced or      on or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the

incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests therefore these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock among other things our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws      establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders these procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken generally to be timely notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than  days nor more than  days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year our amended and restated bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholders notices these requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting      provide our board of directors the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock this ability makes it possible for

provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors with each class as nearly equal in number as possible serving staggered three year terms other than directors which may be elected by holders of preferred stock if any this system of electing and removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us because it generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors      provide that we renounce any interest in certain business opportunities presented to american securities llc or any of its officers directors agents members affiliates and subsidiaries other than business opportunities presented to such person in his or her capacity as an officer or

prospectus is a part remains effective certain major stockholders or their permitted transferees including asp fml holdings llc have the right to require us to engage in an underwritten offering in respect of their shares piggyback rights  if at any time subject to certain customary limitations and exceptions we propose to conduct a registered offering of common stock for our own account or for

omissions that occurred prior to any such amendment repeal or modification our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that we will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law under delaware law we may purchase insurance on behalf of any officer director employee or other agent for any liability arising out of that persons actions as our officer director employee or agent regardless of whether delaware law would permit indemnification we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and officers these agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under delaware law against liability that may arise by reason of their service to us and to    table of contents advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified we believe that the

hold securities in accounts at banks or brokers generally will not be recognized by us as legal holders of debt securities this is called holding in street name instead we would recognize only the bank or broker or the financial institution that the bank or broker uses to hold its securities these intermediary banks brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal interest and other payments on the debt securities either because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to if you hold debt securities in street name you should check with your own institution to find out        how it handles payments and notices        whether it imposes fees or charges        how it would handle voting if applicable        whether and how you can instruct it to send you debt securities registered in your own name so you can be a direct holder as described below and        if applicable how it would pursue rights under your debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to protect their interests direct holders our obligations as well as the obligations of the trustee under the indenture and those of any third parties employed by us or the trustee under the indenture run only to persons who are registered as holders of debt securities issued under the indenture as noted above we do not have obligations to you if you hold in street name or other indirect means either because you choose to hold debt securities in that manner or because the debt securities are issued in the form of global securities as described below for example once we make payment to the registered holder we have no further responsibility for the payment even if that holder is legally required to pass the payment along to you as a street name customer but does not do so    table of contents bookentry delivery and form we have obtained the information in this section concerning dtc clearstream banking sa or clearstream and euroclear bank sanv as operator of the euroclear system or euroclear and the bookentry system and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable but we take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement the debt securities will be issued as fullyregistered global securities which will be deposited with or on behalf of dtc and registered at the request of dtc in the name of cede  co beneficial interests in the global securities will be represented through bookentry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in dtc the direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers investors may elect to hold their interests in the global securities through either dtc in the united states or in europe through clearstream or through euroclear investors may hold their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems interests held through clearstream and euroclear will be recorded on dtcs books as being held by the us depositary for each of clearstream and euroclear the us depositories which us depositories will in turn hold interests on behalf of their participants customers securities accounts unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in denominations of  and multiples of  in excess thereof except as set forth below the global securities may be transferred in whole and not in part only to another nominee of dtc or to a successor of dtc or its nominee debt securities represented by a global security can be exchanged for definitive securities in registered form only if        dtc notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a qualified successor depositary within  days after receiving that notice        at any time dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act and we do not appoint a successor depositary within  days after becoming aware that dtc has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency        we in our sole discretion determine that such global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form or elect to terminate the bookentry system through dtc and notify the trustee of our decision or        an event of default with respect to the debt securities represented by that global security has occurred and is continuing a global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for definitive securities issued in authorized denominations in registered form for the same aggregate amount the definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by dtc we will make principal and interest payments on all debt securities represented by a global security to the paying agent which in turn will make payment to dtc or its nominee as the case may be as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the debt securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the indenture accordingly we the trustee and any paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for        any aspect of dtcs records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a debt security represented by a global security        any other aspect of the relationship between dtc and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants or        the maintenance supervision or review of any of dtcs records relating to those beneficial ownership interests    table of contents dtc has advised us that its current practice is to credit direct participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on dtcs records upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information the underwriters or agents for the debt securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name and will be the sole responsibility of those participants and not of dtc or its nominee the trustee any agent of ours or us subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements bookentry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note dtc so long as dtc or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security dtc or its nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the debt securities owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in their names will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders of debt securities under the indenture accordingly each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of dtc and if that person is not a dtc participant on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities the laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form these laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account we understand that under existing industry practices if we request holders to take any action or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the indenture then dtc would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc and its participants for that global security the conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any

respective direct or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations what is a global security a global security is a special type of indirectly held debt security as described above under street name and other indirect holders if we choose to issue debt securities in the form of global securities the ultimate beneficial owners can only hold the debt securities in street name we would do this by requiring that the global security be registered in the name of a financial institution we select and by requiring that the debt securities included in the global security not be transferred to the name of any other direct holder unless the special circumstances described below occur the financial institution that acts as the sole direct holder of the global security is called the depositary any person wishing to own a debt security issued in the form of a global security must do so indirectly by virtue of an account with a broker bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary the applicable prospectus supplement will indicate whether a series of debt securities will be issued only in the form of global securities and if so will describe the specific terms of the arrangement with the depositary special investor considerations for global securities as an indirect holder an investors rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investors financial institution and of the depositary as well as general laws relating to securities transfers we do not recognize this type of investor as a holder of debt securities and instead deal only with the depositary that holds the global security an investor should be aware that if a series of debt securities are issued only in the form of global securities        the investor cannot get debt securities of that series registered in his or her own name        the investor cannot receive physical certificates for his or her interest in the debt securities of that series        the investor will be a street name holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the debt securities of that series and protection of his or her legal rights relating to the debt securities of that series as described under  street name and other indirect holders        the investor may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities of that series to some insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law to own their securities in the form of physical certificates and        the depositarys policies will govern payments transfers exchange and other matters relating to the investors interest in the global security we and the trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositarys actions or for its records of ownership interests in the global security we and the trustee also do not supervise the depositary in any way    table of contents special situations when the global security will be terminated in a few special situations a global security will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing debt securities after that exchange the choice of whether to hold debt securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor investors must consult their own bank or brokers to find out how to have their interests in debt securities transferred to their own name so that they will be direct holders the rights of street name investors and direct holders in debt securities have been previously described in subsections entitled street name and other indirect holders and direct holders the special situations for termination of a global security are        when the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary and we do not appoint a successor depositary        when an event of default on the series of debt securities has occurred and has not been cured and        at any time if we decide to terminate a global security the applicable prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement when a global security terminates only the
