statement to our shareholders on november   the charter amendment will be filed with the secretary of state of the state of nevada on or after december    days after the date of the mailing of the information statement if the proposed charter amendment were not adopted by written consent it would have been required to be considered by the companys stockholders at special stockholders meeting convened for the specific purpose of approving the charter amendment the elimination of the need for a special meeting of stockholders to approve the charter amendment is made possible by section  of the nevada revised statute the nrs which provides that the written consent of the holders of outstanding shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders having at least a majority of the voting power may be substituted for such a special meeting pursuant to section  of the nrs a majority of the voting power is required in order to amend the companys articles of incorporation to create its preferred shares in order to eliminate the costs and management time involved in holding a special meeting and in order to effect the charter amendment as early as possible the board of directors of the company voted to utilize the written consent of the holders of a majority of voting power as stated in its quarterly and annual filings with the securities and exchange commission the company remains a shell company and its principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business as of the date of this filing the company has not entered into any letter of intent or formal or definitive agreements with any party regarding business opportunities for the company moreover the company believes that a business combination will not occur at any time prior to april   however the company cannot predict that such business combination will occur on or about such date or at all nor can the company predict the type of business operation or terms and conditions of any such combination the company common stock will continue to trade on the otcqb tier of the pink sheet markets under the trading symbol pvnc the company is a shell company as defined in rule b of the securities exchange act of  the exchange act our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to i filing exchange act reports and ii investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as january   the company has  in cash there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company managements plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering our management has not entered into any agreements with any party regarding a business combination any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide audited financial statements at or within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction we are subject to all the reporting requirements included in the exchange act included in these requirements is our duty to file audited financial statements as part of our form k to be filed with the securities and exchange commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition as well as our audited financial statements included in our annual report on form k if such audited financial statements are not available at closing or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the exchange act or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the target business the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable at the discretion of our present management a business combination with a target business will normally involve the transfer to the target business of the majority of our common stock and the substitution by the target business of its own management and board of directors the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company on september   three of our shareholders owning  shares of common stock or approximately  of the total outstanding shares approved an

machine sale operations on december   the company entered into an agreement wherein the company had a change in control which resulted in the divestiture of the atm division “quick pay” the company divested itself of the atm machine sales operations on october     the company’s business is to pursue a business combination through acquisition or merger with an existing company no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company   effective december   a change of control occurred with respect to the company pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into by and among the company paragon capital lp “seller” and yik kei ong “buyer” as nominee for certain third parties seller assigned transferred and conveyed to buyer as nominee  shares of common stock of company and convertible notes of the company totaling  the convertible notes were convertible into common stock of the company at  per share for a total of  shares of common stock on the closing of the above transaction mr alan donenfeld the then sole officer of seller resigned in all officer capacities from the company and yik kei ong was appointed interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company immediately following the closing of the transaction the convertible notes  in principal amount were converted into  shares of common stock of the company after giving effect to the above described transaction the controlling shareholders of the company are wooi huat teow chee chow teow and ee meng teow   on march   the board of

financial officer and secretary replacing mr yik kei ong who had resigned in all capacities as an officer of the company on that date as president of the company mr ng will assume the role of chairman of the company board of directors   basis of presentation   the summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in the understanding of the financial statements these policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied   interim financial statements   the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap for interim financial information in accordance with article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements in our opinion all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for fair presentation have been included while we believe that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto contained for the year ended april   included our form k filed on august   operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates                cash and cash equivalents   the company maintains cash balances in a noninterest bearing account that currently does not exceed federally insured limits for the purpose of the statements of cash flows all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments   the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due to their short maturity   beneficial conversion feature   if the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature “bcf” a bcf is recorded by the company as a debt discount in those circumstances the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the bcf and the company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method   net loss per share calculation   basic net loss per common share eps is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   revenue recognition   four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on our managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products and services delivered and the collectability of those amounts   for the three months ended july   and  the company did not recognize any revenue   stockbased compensation   the company recognizes compensation cost based upon the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the blackscholes pricing model during the three months ended july   and  the company did not issue any shares for services nor did the company issue any options as stock based compensation to any officers directors or nonemployees   income taxes   the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized   uncertain tax positions   the company evaluates tax positions in a twostep process the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position if a tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as long term liabilities in the financial statements    subsequent events   the company has evaluated all transactions from july   through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration   recently accounting pronouncements   there were various accounting standards and interpretations issued during  none of which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position operations or cash flows                note  going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business for the three months ended july   the company reported a net loss of  and has reported an accumulated deficit of  as of july   these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company   note  advances due to related party   as of april   an entity related to the company’s controlling shareholders has advanced funds totaling  to the company to meet its working capital requirements the advances are unsecured interest free and due on demand   as of july
