nasdaq vrex  current price   ebitda m  mv b buy with target price appreciation bear  base  bull  investment thesis  recommendation varians spinoff varex has hit the ground running growing into a leading producer in the worlds  billion dollar diagnostic imaging market the multilayered complexity of digital detector and xray tube products has stimulated inefficiencies in market pricing of vrexs assets evebitda multiple trading at a fourth of the industry average while the recent acquisition of perkinelmers medical imaging business offers overlooked opportunities for product crossselling and manufacturing scale with a price target of  varex presents an appealing  upside even without assuming complete utilization of potential synergies with perkinelmers medical imaging segment company overview varex is an international designer and manufacturer of costeffective diagnostic imaging solutions for original equipment manufacturers oems in medical  of sales and industrial  of sales segments  the medical imaging segment manufactures over  xray tubes for four primary medical diagnostic radiology applications computed tomography ct scanners radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging special procedures and mammography oem customers incorporate vrex products into their medical diagnostic radiation therapy dental and veterinary imaging systems  the industrial business segment designs manufactures sells and services xray accelerators imaging processing software and image detection products for use in security and industrial inspection applications such as cargo screening and nondestructive examination in a variety of applications for instance oem customers sell the systems with vrex components to customs and other government agencies for use in ports and borders to screen overland rail and sea cargo for contraband weapons narcotics and explosives as well as for manifest verification varex also sells its industrial products to commercial enterprises in the casting power aerospace chemical petrochemical and automotive industries for nondestructive product examination purposes such as industrial inspection and manufacturing quality control industry overview  medical imaging the most immediate market for vrexs technologies is a  billion dollar xray radiography market which is expected to grow at a cagr of  to  in the medical imaging market flat panel detectors are experiencing rapid growth driven by a market transition from analog to digital systems due to xray dose reductions lower production costs increased patient throughput and uslegislated reimbursement cuts for analog systems as product cycles shorten there will be significant replacement opportunity for the plus analog units that exist globally with a fragmented competitive landscape and many oems lacking scale the industry continues to outsource flat panel detector manufacturing to specialists such as vrex while offering substantial potential for consolidation moreover the need for accurate imaging is capable of addressing modalities from magnetic resonance imaging to medical sonography to nuclear medicine functional imaging combining these segments of biological imaging taps into a cumulative  billion medical imaging market  cagr each sophisticated imaging approach sends signals into the body to spatially map out organs although these other types of imaging do not require xray tubing they utilize vrex products such as digital detectors  of vrex revenues and connectors  processing workstations  of revenues  industrial and security imaging as disruptive technologies such as d printing achieve greater adoption and automation continues to redefine the industrial landscape inprocess inspections using imaging and detection software continue to experience growing demand the addressable industrial market currently at  million is expected to more than double to  billion dollars by  for a cagr of  furthermore with airport screening and baggage security at the forefront of the public consciousness security imaging is expected to also grow to  billion by  in the united states alone the capitalintensity of manufacturing imaging components will provide sustainable moats to leading manufacturers such as vrex and prevent competitive entry going forward mispricing  value drivers  the market is discounting the crossselling capabilities of varexs acquisition of perkinelmers medical imaging business on may st  varex completed the acquisition of perkinelmers imaging business for  million the move consolidates two of the three major independent producers in the highend dynamic detector market perkinelmer is headquartered in waltham mass with multiple operations across europe and specializes in producing highresolution digital flat panel cmos detectors currently perkinelmer is already projected to add  million in annual sales  of purchase price with endmarkets in medical industrial and dental imaging however vrexs new product portfolio which blends offerings of xray tubes linear accelerators and now cmosbased digital detectors can achieve rapid margin expansion and topline revenue growth through successful perkinelmervrex package offerings for example if a vrex xray tube is sold with each digital detector bought by newly acquired detector customers sales would rise by an additional   of purchase price million in annual revenues with combined production volumes also increasing manufacturing scale and improving direct material costs perkinelmers imaging business serves as a bulwark against margin deterioration and offers return above its purchase price within two years even without extensive cross selling  deeper understanding of vrexs product mix reveals robust opportunities for gross margin improvements protected by longterm economic moats and product scale xray tubes radiographic xrays use a small amount of radiation that passes through the body to quickly create a d image of a patients anatomy to assess injury or disease computed tomography ct combines the power of multiple d xrays with computers to produce d crosssectional views of the body the system delivers up to two times improvement in volumetric resolution detecting smaller lesions in tissues that differ in physical density by  the competitive dynamics of the xray tube market are split between higher end ct tubes and lowerend radiographic tubes radiographic tubes which are cheap and easy to manufacture have experienced a highly competitive market with multiple producers on the other hand uppertier ct imaging components are defined by amplified levels of technological complexity intellectual property and engineering that result in higher sales prices and gross margins due to manufacturing complexity there are no independent manufacturers of ct tubes other than varex with production limited to oems with inhouse production capabilities such as ge siemens phillips toshiba during the second quarter of  vrex accepted and shipped an order for a package of components for several hundred general radiographic systems consequently the quarters unfavorable shift to lowermargin components dropped gross margin  to  however management has recognized the competitive merits of pursuing higherend product markets and a significant portion of revenues going forward will come from the sale of highend xray tubes used in ct imaging for instance vrex recently renewed a year pricing agreement with toshiba medical systems for  million dollars worth of ct tubes a separate oneyear pricing agreement to supply digital detectors and highvoltage connectors worth  million will further boost revenues while securing higher margins in the future of the top  ct scanners per providian medical ges brightspeed elite philips brilliance  and siemens somatom sensation  vrex produces a partner ct tube product for all of them even more so nearly  of tubes revenues comes from replacement tubes ct tubes not only produce the highest product margins but are also replaced more frequently every  years than radiographic tubes  years based on previous analysis of varians medical imaging patent portfolio vrex owns approximately  patents issued in the united states and  patents issued throughout the rest of the world and had  patent applications on file by targeting upperlevel xray tube segments and locking in patent protection vrex stands to secure longterm organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion digital detectors the second largest chunk of vrex revenues stems from digital detectors which are also broken down into the lowerend radiographic detectors and the higherend dynamic detectors when watching a movie dynamic detectors can be likened to a fiveminute scene while radiographic detectors are single shots while the highlycompetitive market for radiographic detectors has been experiencing price erosion since initial product introductions  years ago dynamic detectors are only beginning to blossom for us users reimbursements for studies digitized with a radiographic readers will be cut starting in  fueling further adoption of highermargin digital detectors management already produced  more detectors in the quarter than one year ago continued demand for highermargin digital detectors will be driven by the growth of the global dental imaging market  cagr and the growth of mobile carm systems for surgical applications less than  of mobile carms manufactured by oems are shipped as digital systems as the cost difference between analog image intensifiers and digital detectors continues to diminish digital detectors will grow to dominate the market in coming years  the market is preoccupied with vrexs domestic operations even as key opportunities for expansion lay in emerging markets vrexs second quarter revenue breakdown saw only  of revenues stem from sales in the americas  million while emea  million and apac  million comprised  and  of sales respectively while revenues in the americas and emea saw contraction of  and  respectively apac experienced a notable  rise in sales pulling total revenues up  americas revenues declined primarily due to lower sales of xray sources and digital detectors meanwhile apac revenues rose due to higher sales of xray tubes digital detectors and high voltage connectors partially due to a large tenderbased order shipped during the quarter in the q  earnings call management noted that were working on a number of new ct tubes and highvoltage connectors for chinese oems who have ct imaging systems in various stages of development and market introduction it is precisely such distinctions between market development of american and asian provinces that leads to sharper insight into vrexs future growth trajectory while management believes that approximately  of xray imaging systems in the us have already converted to full digital the worldwide conversion rate toward digital is only at  by  medical imaging is expected to convert from  analog to  analog while industrial imaging is expected to convert from  analog to  analog of the  new oems in china serving as system aggregators compiling components into a full ct system vrex has already established  new partnerships as chinese markets are focused on advanced cardiac ct applications and new ct tubes for mammography vrexs expansion in international operations will yield incrementally higher margins than domestic operations while delivering more room for future growth mediating the  margin deterioration recently seen in the medical imaging segment valuation  assumptions vrex is currently trading at a severe discount to industry peers dxcm gmed alog cmd abmd with an evebitda of  compared to an industry median of  given the abovementioned opportunities for modest margin expansion as the gradual integration of the perkinelmer assets into company operations the base case undershoots management revenuegrowth expectations by  assumes a  evebitda substantially below the current industry median and targets  appreciation given the above sensitivity analysis multiple expansion toward the industry median serves as a robust confirmation of the discounted cash flow analysis summarized above catalysts v third quarter reporting of sales combining synergies from the perkinelmer deal would demonstrate enhancement of revenues from the new product portfolio and increase market awareness of vrexs new topline revenue composition v future purchase orders from apac clients would induce greater media attention around vrexs growing dominance in asia key risks  mitigants v international customers more than half of vrexs revenues are generated from customers outside of the united states strengthening of the dollar will raise external sourcing costs increasing customer petitions for discounts causing delayed purchasing decisions or increasing reliance on inhouse manufacturing mitigant vrexs accretive acquisitions have improved scale and increased cost competitiveness while complexity of production in higherend products precludes competitive entry in production v separation agreement per the separation and distribution agreement vrex will transfer all cash and cash equivalents in excess of  million to varian for  mitigant the excess cash payments to complete the transfer is approximately  million which will be amply covered by cash currently held on balance sheet of  million disclosure i amwe are long vrex i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation

companywide gross margin declined to  in the second quarter of fiscal year  from  in the yearago quarter due to higher costs of quality and a shift in product mix to lower margin radiographic components which were partially offset by increased sales of higher margin xray sources for security applications during the quarter the company accepted and shipped an order for a package of components for several hundred general radiographic systems consisting of xray tubes digital detectors and high voltage connectors while this package increased varexs revenues it created an unfavorable mix shift to lower margin components which was a contributing factor in reducing the gross margin rate the operating margin was  in the second quarter versus  in the yearago quarter reflecting the lower gross margin higher rd investment was largely offset by lower sga expensesi am pleased to report topline growth of  for the current quarter and  year to date since the slowdown in
