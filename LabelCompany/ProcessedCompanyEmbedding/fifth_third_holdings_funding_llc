distributions due on that payment date and b the fair market value of the receivables and other issuing entity property other than the reserve account plus all amounts owing to the swap counterparty as of that payment date it is expected that at the time this option becomes available to the servicer or any successor to the servicer only the class a notes and the class b notes will be outstanding notice of redemption under the indenture must be given by the indenture trustee not later than  days prior to the applicable redemption date to each holder of notes all notices of redemption will state i the redemption date ii the redemption price iii that the record date otherwise applicable to that redemption date is not applicable and that payments will be made only upon presentation and surrender of those notes and the place where those notes are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price iv that interest on the notes will cease to accrue on the redemption date and v the cusip numbers if applicable for the notes in addition the issuing entity will notify each rating agency listed under   ratings  below upon redemption of the notes events of default the occurrence of any one of the following events will be an  event of default  under the indenture      a default in the payment of any interest on any note of the controlling class when the same becomes due and payable and such default shall continue for a period of five business days      default in the payment of the principal of any note at the related final scheduled payment date or the redemption date      any failure by the issuing entity to duly observe or perform in any material respect any of its material covenants or agreements in the indenture which failure materially and adversely affects the interests of the noteholders and which continues unremedied for  days after receipt by the issuing entity of written notice thereof from the indenture trustee or noteholders evidencing a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes of the controlling class      any representation or warranty of the issuing entity made in the indenture proves to be incorrect in any material respect when made which failure materially and adversely affects the rights of the noteholders and which failure continues unremedied for  days after receipt by the issuing entity of written notice thereof from the indenture trustee or noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the notes of the controlling class and      the occurrence of certain events which if involuntary remain unstayed for more than  days of bankruptcy insolvency receivership or liquidation of the issuing entity notwithstanding the foregoing a delay in or failure of performance referred to under the first four bullet   s table of contents points above for a period of  days will not constitute an event of default if that delay or failure was caused by force majeure or other similar occurrence the amount of principal required to be paid to noteholders under the indenture however generally will be limited to amounts available to make such payments in accordance with the priority of payments thus the failure to pay principal of a class of notes due to a lack of amounts available to make such a payment will not result in the occurrence of an event of default until the final scheduled payment date for that class of notes issuing entity property the primary assets of the issuing entity will be a pool of retail motor vehicle installment sales contracts andor installment loans secured by a combination of new and used automobiles and lightduty trucks we refer to these contracts and loans as  receivables  to the pool of those receivables as the  receivables pool  and to the persons who financed their purchases or refinanced existing obligations with these contracts and loans as  obligors  the receivables were underwritten in accordance with the originators respective underwriting criteria the receivables identified on the schedule of receivables delivered by the fth llc on the closing date will be transferred to the depositor by fth llc and then transferred by the depositor to the issuing entity the issuing entity will grant a security interest in the receivables and the other issuing entity property to the indenture trustee on behalf of the noteholders and the swap counterparty the  issuing entity property  will include the following      the receivables including collections on the receivables after the applicable cutoff date the cutoff date for the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date is                          which we refer to as the initial  cutoff date  and the cutoff date for the receivables sold to the issuing

under the purchase agreement and      the proceeds of any and all of the above statistical information the statistical information in this prospectus is based on the receivables as of      which we refer to as the cutoff date the statistical distribution of the characteristics of the actual receivables pool will vary somewhat from the statistical distribution of those characteristics in this prospectus because the actual pool will be a subset of the receivables in the statistical pool any variance between the characteristics of the statistical pool and the actual pool will not be material
