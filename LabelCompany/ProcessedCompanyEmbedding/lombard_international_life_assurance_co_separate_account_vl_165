person of such a person acting as principal to knowingly purchase or to sell any security or other property from or to such registered company  section b of the act provides generally that the commission may grant an order exempting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section a of the act if evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  the merger may be subject to the provisions of section a of the act because it could be viewed as involving an investment company va account scudder account aim vl account selling its assets to another investment company glenbrook multimanager glenbrook vl that is affiliated by reason of having

necessary to exempt the merger from the provisions of section a of the act  applicants assert that the terms of the merger are fair and reasonable the transfer of assets held by variable annuity account scudder account and aim vl account respectively will be made at the relative net asset values of the subaccounts consequently the interests of glenbrook multimanager and glenbrook vl owners

aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of variable annuity account and scudder account credited to such contract immediately prior to the merger likewise each aim vl account contract will be credited immediately after the merger with units of the glenbrook vl having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of aim vl account credited to such contract immediately prior to the merger the merger will not result in any change in charges costs fees or expenses borne by any contract owner no direct or indirect costs will be incurred by any separate account concerned as a result of the merger therefore the proposed transactions will not result in dilution of the economic interests of any contract owners in addition the merger will result in no change in the investment options available to glenbrook contract owners each subaccount of the separate accounts will continue to invest in the same fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger  the consolidation of any overlapping subaccounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each glenbrook contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging subaccounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving subaccount the values of the exchanged interests under the contracts will thus be equivalent the accumulation unit values for these subaccounts will not change and the contract value of any affected contract owner immediately after the subaccount consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the subaccount consolidation  applicants assert that the merger do not involve overreaching on the part of any party involved and is consistent with the general purposes of the act start printed page the purposes of the merger are to consolidate three variable annuity separate accounts each of which issue variable annuity contracts into a single separate account and to consolidate two variable life separate accounts each of which issue variable life contracts into a single separate account the merger will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings by glenbrook because it can consolidate its separate account operations the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the glenbrook contracts nor will the merger affect the

each separate account is to invest in the funds as noted above the merger will result in no change to any fund underlying the glenbrook separate accounts each subaccount of the separate accounts will continue to invest in the same fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger accordingly the assets underlying the contracts will continue to be invested in accordance with the policies

in coverage why this amount or any amount for that matter the answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are

than  minutes  freesafe and secure home     »      term life insurance term life insurance a term life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium a term life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments this type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children people with debt obligations and also home buyers it can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy the premiums are based on your age and your health status purchasing a new term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues term life is a death benefit only policy that you buy for a specified length of time think of it like leasing a car you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over you return the car term life is referred to as benefit only insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as whole life it carries no cash surrender value because of this term life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check it is ideal for families that are just starting out or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected but may not be able to afford or desire a permanent life policy however understand that as a person ages over the period of the term monthly premiums may increase it is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse or for single people even for children just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered there are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a term life policy can make up for the investment component of a permanent life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own the earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy annual renewable term life policies are those that are purchased yearbyyear the next year you do not have to prequalify simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate rates for annual renewable policies are at historic lows a young healthy person can get  for only a few hundred dollars per year there are very good rates these days on term life the premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term usually   or  years it is not uncommon for a healthy nonsmoking  yearold male to obtain a  or year policy with a fixed premium of less than  per month so just how much insurance should you buy many things factor into that answer but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least  years of your present salary if you have young children make that around  years so if you make  a year that means at least  to  in coverage feel free to use our life insurance calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances term life insurance is an
