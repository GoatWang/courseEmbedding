our investment team applies a bottomup approach that combines traditional fundamental analysis as well as meetings with management competitors and end clients of the businesses we consider for investment we managed about  billion as of june   and our team collectively owned more than  million in our funds as of march   firm culture our week begins with what heartlanders affectionately refer to as the “monday morning meeting” when analysts portfolio managers and other key team members come together to discuss economic releases market dynamics and industry analysis similarly each week ends with the investment team assembled in our ben graham conference room—aptly named for the founder of the firm’s value investing style—for the “research meeting” focused on stock specific research the agendas vary but the goal of each is consistent—sharing digesting and interpreting information that will give us an advantage when competing in the marketplace these meetings are open to all team members and relationship managers regularly attend to represent the eyes ears and voices of our clients the discussions reflect our midwestern roots in that debates are candid and purposeful with spirited conversations focused on achieving excellence in our investment decisions all investment team members participate on equal footing and are encouraged to express alternate views portfolio managers serve in the role of engaged leaders—not unapproachable stars our quest for constant never ending improvement cnei extends beyond the investment team whether it is earning professional designations or enrolling in classes to develop new skills team members across the firm are strongly encouraged in their pursuit of professional and personal growth we also bring our passionate approach to causes beyond investing high importance is placed on giving back to the community and team members are encouraged to regularly volunteer their time and skills our sponsorship of the many
