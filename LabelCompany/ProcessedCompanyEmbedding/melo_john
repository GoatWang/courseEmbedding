melo john john melo thank you peter good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today ill review our results for the first quarter review the strategic and financial transactions we announced last week and provide our outlook for  ill start with review of our results which kathy will cover later in more detail the first quarter was the fifth consecutive quarter where we more than doubled our product revenue over the prior year we are very pleased with the performance of our products and partnerships and the strong demand we are continuing to experience for each of our products we have now introduced more than  products to date that are each delivery more than  million in annual product revenue and we have three brands that are on track from more than  million annual sales we also have our first three ph molecule in pharmacy where we expect our first molecule of  million or more in annual product sales this year and well on our way to  million in annual sales from that three molecules we have the highest product revenue of any company in our sector and we are just started several of our competitors have indicated in their quarterly filings that they are struggling to get adoption or that they get weak demand from their customers we are working hard to keep up with our customer demand with each of our key segments and each of our partners increasing their  orders during the first quarter ill cover this in more detail and also provide more detailed guidance later during our call our collaboration payments also remained strong over first quarter of  but as we said before are choppy and not very predictable by quarter our partnerships and each payment have been consistent on a yearly basis and are a key differentiator for our business model over our competitors we expect these payments to be slightly over the high end of our  million to  million range this year these partnerships and their relative payments are a strong example of the market leadership weve demonstrated with our technology platform we deliver solutions to our partner supply channels a key partner mentioned to me in the last several weeks you are our product innovation pipeline we appreciate the trust our partners have in us this trust comes from being the fastest to market with predictable timing and cost to engineer scale and produce better products that deliver better economics and product differentiations to our partners this is very different than some of our competitors doing business with related companies and restructuring their contracts to drive revenue our collaboration revenue comes from market leaders where we are delivering products that help them gain competitive advantage and where were both pointing ph to the value share arrangements in our collaboration agreements after the quarter ended we announced our most material partnerships todate in terms of alignment with our strategic direction and growth opportunities our partnership with dsm includes production at world class  at our world class fermentation factory scaling strategic products and developing products for health and nutrition segments this partnership is the direct result of our demonstrated market leadership in nutraceuticals and is structured to provide amyris with a long term financial stability both our partners and investors are seeking this is the most material partnership weve entered into since our ipo and in relationship with opal ph before the ipo we had referenced this partnership during our last call and this is a great example of the choppiness in our collaboration revenue we expect it to close this quarter  to close this deal before the end of the quarter it took a month longer structure this is more long term and very product focus we will deliver the value we expected from this partnership starting later this year our product sales increased  over the first quarter of  our product sales will deliver more revenue in our collaborations this year for the first time since we decided to exit the ethanol trading business and shift away from renewable fuels well more than double product revenue this year to over  million and are on track to deliver over  million of product revenue in  with most of this coming from current partners and products where we are experiencing significant traction let me explain in more details the key drivers of our revenue of what you can expect first we recorded record quarterly biossance sales following the grand successful launch into sephora biossance is delivering high growth sephora told us this is one of the most successful independent brand launches theyve ever experienced this is the business that generated about  in total retail sales in  and is on track for over  million this year and could be  million in retail sales for next year this revenue has little impact on our production capacity we enough production at straight lane to more than meet this retail revenue without any stress on current capacity we really like this business and its fully in our control it has excellent gross margins and its making a real difference to the health of our customers skin and the health of our plan its also an easy business to find the customer and i like that the customer for this business is everyone over  years old that cares about healthy skin we are just scratching the surface of the potential for this business we are in less than  sephora stores we are in the sephoracom store the vitalsignescom store and have several shows on the home shoppe network each of these channels is performing very well and our focus is additional reach to consumers through more channels and more doors as a result of our strong channel partnerships and early retail success we have one of the lowest marketing cost in skin care today we are investing less than  for every dollar of revenue and have very strong customer loyalty repurchase rates customers consumer love our product and some of our products we cant make fast enough to keep in stock we are making a product that truly does make your skin healthier we are about real science behind the product and not just another brand store our history is about better help and access to the best treatments this is a good example of the real impact of our technology the second big driver of product revenue growth is our pharmacy for use to make vitamin e oil this is a partnership weve entered in china and is performing better than all of us expected this represents around  million of our increase in product revenue for  over  and it is as expected to represent over  million of  product revenue this is a great example of white cost leadership and product performance matters using indiscernible as the raw material to make vitamin e results in over  cost advantage and better performing product and process than the alternatives this has provided our partner with a significant competitive advantage our partner has indicated a desire to purchase over  of our indiscernible production for the next two years as they expand their current capacity for vitamin e oil we are considering this indiscernible as we consider the highest value opportunities to use our existing manufacturing capacity this is another critical point of the stipules about our business in comparison to many competitors we are an optimization and value driven business not in volume and utilization business we generate more revenue and create more value by using our limited capacity to make the highest value products and to access the best value share opportunities not by making the most volume of a single molecule we can generate anywhere from  million to  million in product revenue and value share using our current capacity based on the products we chose to make and the amount of indiscernible our third value driver for us arc ph fragments and active cosmetic ingredient business continues to perform very well we expect  to  revenue growth in this business this year and also the commercialization of three new products this is our best year ever in terms of new products and a trend we expect to continue for the coming years our two existing products continue to perform better than expected and our customers continue to expand products in development with us in addition to our  revenue as noted on our last quarterly call and in recent announcements we continue to execute on entering the  billion sugar market with healthy sweeteners that are focused on replacing sugar through our technology based on the progress of our development work we expect industrial production of several leading healthy sweetener products in  we believe were on track to be the lowcost leader of natural white sweeteners with low calories that are substantial and naturally sourced were excited about the partnerships in this segment and the early response from product testing we expect this segment to represent over  million of  product revenue in addition to these products in our core focus markets our performance materials through kuraray for the tire industry and through novvi for industrial lubricants are also performing very well our kuraray business will be doubled what we expected this year as a result of additional tire manufacturers adopting our liquid farnesene rubber and the better than expected success from our fast tire partner launching and finally last week we took another significant step towards funded our company through sustainable selffunding and simplifying our balance sheet the financing and debt reduction transactions to be detailed by kathy was born out of royalty sm approaching us with a desire to have access to our technology which supports dsms strategic markets and help nutrition and materials for amyris dsms channels end market access and keen understanding in selecting the right products for the animal nutrition human nutrition and consumer health markets provide significant strategic value this new relationship is expected to be relatively similar to our partnership with nenter where weve experienced quick success in growing with them in the nutrition market we expect to replicate that success with dsm and leverage each others key strengths to grow in a high growth global markets for animal and human nutrition as well as consumer health in summary were pleased to have put amyris on much solid financial footing in fact the strongest indiscernible the company has been on since our ipo and we have lowered our debt by one third while gaining the leading company in health and nutrition as a leading shareholder and strategic partner so now let me summarize product revenue matters it is the indication of how well our strategy is working and the impact we can have on the health of the planet our product revenue is predictable and is growing at a better rate than we expected we are the leading product revenue generator in our sector and were not having an issue with customers and consumers wanting our products collaborations are the key to our product success our partners select products that are strategic and provide them with competitive advantage the revenue from collaborations is choppy quarteronquarter but predictable over the full year weve the leading product and partner portfolio in our sector and it is and has been delivering significant value the sweetener opportunity is the significant step up for amyris dsm is a deep strategic partner that understand and is the leader in health and nutrition markets the sweetener business and the dsm partnership provide us with significant competitive advantage and can be the real difference maker for our technology platform having deep impact on the health of our clients our competitive advantage comes from having the leading technology platform in our sector we designed and engineer chemistry for a healthier planet we use natures biology to produce to deliver lowest cost products that are strategic to our product mix we are establishing strong leadership positions in large markets that are probative in every day consumer lives our focus on healthy nutrition personal care and performance material markets and our mission to make better products for healthier planet is starting to really deliver each of our key partners has increased their orders in the first quarter now let me turn to kathy for a detail review of our financial results and then ill provide our outlook for  kathy kathy valiasek thank you john and good afternoon everyone we are pleased to have recently announced some key strategic and financial transactions that we have mentioned on our last earnings call this inquisitive series of agreements were up to  million in equity financing led by royal dsm and including other investors some of which have previously engaged in equity andor debt investors in amyris tranche ph one of approximately  million closed this past thursday and the second tranche of up to  million which is subject to approval by dsms managing board is expected to close within ninety days of last week closing this second tranche is also led by royal dsm and will include other investors of each closing dsm will gain one board fee since our last call we have improved our cash liquidity in our balance sheet and are in the process of reducing our debt by approximately  million deploying less than about  million in cash to achieve the reduction aside from our term loans for our facilities we now have current maturities of approximately  million together with the debt reduction and the cash from the closing of tranche two we feel we are well on our way to sustainability now let me take you through to our first quarter results following which ill detail the financing we announced last week and how it effects and simplifies our adjustment capital structure first quarter revenues were  million compared with  million for the first quarter of  while collaborations were down somewhat due to the timing of inflows the top line performance due to continued growth in product sales product sales were  million up  over  million for the first quarter of  this increase was the result of vitamin e sales which continue to ramp liquid indiscernible shipments to our indiscernible as well as the shipment to one of our fragment partners and growth within our indiscernible related sales collaboration revenues of  million were about  million lower than the year ago quarter due to the timing of milestone inflows and the delayed signing of new partnerships we anticipate that q  revenue will increase sequentially and quarteroverquarter driven by anticipated strong product demand and milestone based recognition of indiscernible collaboration revenue and we anticipate the same level of revenue ramp from q through q as we experienced last year adjusted gross margin which excludes depreciation inventory position and excess capacity charges was  million compared to an adjusted growth margin of  million to the same period a year ago this was impacted by our need to run the indiscernible plant through what has historically been a seasonal shutdown period to the plant every year in q due to the rainy season and at the same time the annual shutdown of the sugar mill adjacent to our plant for the third time we needed to run straight through the season in order to maintain customer demand and ship on time as a result the vhp ph molasses at higher cost than sugar were used in addition to higher cost incurred due to the rainy season we expect our adjusted gross profit and margins to dramatically improve for the second quarter as were now out of the seasonal issue that impacted cost i will also note that our anticipated balance share on products shipped in q somewhat offset adjusted gross loss reported for the quarter as we achieved recognition for the value share for the first quarter of  selling general and administrative expenses were  million compared with  million for the same period last year here we continue to keep these expenses in check despite the  quarteroverquarter increase in total revenue this was offset by higher rd expenses that came in at  million compared with  million for the same period last year due to collaboration activity with darpa department of energy and ginkgo bio works adjusted operating expenses representing combined rd and sga expenses excluding stock based comp and depreciation and amortization were  million this was up from  million for the year ago quarter primarily reflecting collaborations related rd activity net loss for the first quarter of  was  million or  per basic and dilute shared compared to the same period last year of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share the significant driver of the quarteroverquarter increase in net loss was tied to much lower gain from the change in fair value of derivative in q of  up  million compared with  million in q of  adjusted net loss for first quarter  excluding these items and stock based compensation was  million or  per basic share this compared with an adjusted net loss of  million or  per basic share and  per diluted share for the same period a year ago now let me take a moment to review our debt at march st as well as the impact of the tranche one financing and debt conversions that we announced this past thursday after that ill take you through what we believe will be a much improved capital structure once we complete our planned second tranche financing as previously mentioned we have been able to reduce our debt significantly since our last call in connection with indiscernible transaction we had convertible debt holders convert approximately  million from total amount of debt and also certain shareholders converted their loans to equity of  million in principle also since march st we had debt holders convert  million into equity at conversion prices ranging from  to  additionally we paid cash of less than  million to the entire certain short term note the net reduction in process related to these transactions totaled about  million or overall about  reduction in debt we have also extended the term of one of our notes to  in the amount of  million indiscernible term loan for our facilities we now have current maturities of approximately  million the net significant debt maturity is not until q of  as we announced last week we closed of approximately  million in equity financing  million coming from our new long term strategic partner dsm and  million from other financial investors the transaction structure was fairly complex due to nasdaq rules allowing for sale of equity at a discount in excess of  only with a shareholder vote which we expect to hold during the first week of july the preferred stock holding and financing will be automatically converted to common stock within  days of shareholder approval the transaction was priced at a  discount to market discount and used transactions that fairly typical especially within our industry and given the recent volatility in our share price together with our anticipated revenue growth a cash from tranche one of our recent financing and the expected cash from tranche two and the progress we have made to restructure and reduce our debt we feel that amyris is now on a path to sustainability looking forward we are encouraged by the progress we have made towards strengthening amyris to create a better financial foundation for our rapidly growing company now ill turn the call back to john john melo thanks kathy while we still have a lot of work to do weve made significant steps to solve legacy issues regarding our capital structure and our debt overhang this will simplify our company reduce interest expense and provide greater clarity to our stakeholders and partners that we engaged with on really moving forward to long term product innovation this will also enhance our ability to continue our growth fast and to lead the company in the sector for  and beyond the indiscernible of our technology platform is known and our ability to mutually succeeded with our partners is evident by our strong relationships with partners like indiscernible dsm indiscernible and many others this reputation is why partners like mentor and dsm have approached us and it has and will continue to support for the growth for amyris let me now turn to our outlook our product revenue has delivered five consecutive quarters of doubling yearonyear revenue growth and we expect this strong growth to continue and to be predictable we expect product revenue for  up over  million and over  million in  we expect collaborations for  to be in the high end of our  million to  million annual collaboration revenue range the collaboration revenue is choppy and not predictable by quarter that is expected for full year delivery for  we expect total revenues of between  million and  million for full year  this equates to over  product revenue growth over  and another strong year of performance with our collaboration partners and the resulting payments from these partners for  we expect total revenue to exceed  million the majority of our product revenue growth between  and  is derive from our sweetener ph products vitamin e oil and the values share of our ingredients business all of our other products are also growing but have a less material contribution to our business for  we expect continued material growth from these key products the additional benefit from the three new products we are launching this year in our ingredient business and the first year of product revenue from our sweetener business so in summary first we are demonstrating clear leadership in our sector were delivering material product revenue growth our competitors are not secondly our product revenue is predictable and our collaboration revenue is choppy quarteronquarter we are the leading partner and product portfolio in our sector and yearonyear our collaborations are delivering the best of our business model are value share components is just starting to drive cash for the company we generated less than  million last year in value share for  well generate between  million and  million and for  we expect  million to  million in value share this is pure margin from the sharing of the cost benefits we delivered for our customers thirdly we now have three significant step out opportunities in our portfolio number one our skin care line is delivering products consumers want we are selling out our stock it is a product line where we control our destiny second farnesene is delivering a real breakthrough molecule it is on track to become our first  million molecule annually over time thirdly key partner in health and nutrition with dsm we are very excited about the depth of knowledge and the success they have had in the food and nutrition markets connectively our best in class technology to combine for accelerate growth in this segment lastly weve the best cash position since our ipo and the lowest net debt that weve had in over three years were well positioned to be selfsustaining from a cash position and a much more attractive partner for our collaborators and investors there is no other shoe to drop thank you for your continued support and your continued help in making the world healthier weve succeeded in indiscernible becoming a successful fuel  renewable fuel company and now have the necessary traction to thrive and have the positive impact that we aspire for a healthier planet id now like to open the line for any questions you may have krystal can you help us questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from sameer joshi from rodman and renshaw your line is open sameer joshi my first question is that you repeatedly made the comment that youre differentiated from  and youve seen success in your products that your competitors have not what do you attribute this to like what is the reason that youre seeing success and whereas others are not being able to capture market share john melo i think it is early sameer so i hope  hold hope and i think the industry in the world needs all of our competitors to succeed in getting their products to market i think our difference is weve been doing this for ten years weve over  billion invested in the company and we built a platform that is now a very predictable were not a single product company we basically take what customers need for their business we engineer it we scale it and we produce it the fact that weve a predictable platform the fact that were now engineering products for our customers in less than one year at a cost thats less than  per molecule those two data points i think are step outs in our industry and we are not done yet i mean there is still a long ways to go i think the other part is the factory the fact that we can actually tell the customer we are going to engineer producing and deliver it to you is something no one else in the industry has been able to achieve so i think the fact that the platform is what it is its predictable its low cost and delivers what customers want and the fact that our factory can churn those products and deliver really takes us out of the group of competitors that i recall companies doing science experience and indiscernible companies that are actually delivering real commercial success if you look at product revenue the only competitor that was even near us was intrexon and they delivered less product revenue than we did in the last quarter and they have flattened out with their product revenue so i look at that and think that is a perfect example of a company to have lot of science lots of experiments with no real traction in delivery products to market sameer joshi speaking of production capacity brotas  was ground broken in january can you give us an update on the progress of that build out john melo sure than development is going very well we are on track to have the plans completed build out by begin this  i would expect in the fourth quarter of  i would expect first production in the first quarter of  sameer joshi and the outlook you have given for  and some of it for  it can all be achieved do you think the existing capacity at brotas right john melo yes we will be using  we are using this year a little bit and more next year contract sites to meet all of our demand so basically when you think of it is contract sites will be a bridge to brotas  in  and we identified those and are already starting to detect trends for some of those contract sites sameer joshi just one more before i move on to the debt transaction can you give us an update on the noncore assets are you getting any revenues or generating any revenues from the noncore assets that you are holding for sale john melo one of the things that happened is one of those noncore assets that we classified as noncore has become a significant revenue driver for us so i would say the only noncore that we have now is already something that we have started bringing in other investors too and we will continue which is really our indiscernible joint venture and as a equate business we think lubricants are great future especially the newer lubricants but we think our role in that business is purely as a supplier and we are seeing significant demand and interest from industrial companies wanting to invest and become partners in that business place we did that already last year we will continue to do that this year and as a result we will continue to take down our ownership and just focus on being a supply for that industry sameer joshi and you mentioned sweetener product do you think it will be introduce in  and you will have some revenue from that in  john melo we expect about  million or so in revenue from sweeteners in  that is a partner project so were not saying that because we hope to fill the market ourselves we actually are partnered with people who are very integrated with the market have existing supply agreements and are help against to get the product soon and ensure that were the best in class sameer joshi just so a clarification from kathleen on the debt so  million of debt is being reduced only  million cash is being used so roughly  million is converted or retired how should we look at it that remainder  million kathy valiasek  million to  million is correct sameer joshi and has it already occurred or is it  will it occur after the  day second closing sorry elimination of  kathy valiasek this is all already occurred sameer joshi oh so the  million debt is either converted or repaid already john melo correct correct operator thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from jeff osborne from cowen and company your line is open jeff osborne just a couple of questions im trying to sum the numbers that you gave to get to the  million so if i heard you right for product revenue youre talking about  million this year in biossance revenue  million i think i heard you see in vitamin e and then on the value share for ingredients i think i heard  million to  million so i think im missing  million to  million can you just help me where would that be coming through john melo yes ill give you the numbers weve may have  as giving you a little bit more ranges so let me give you the big buckets flavors and fragrances  million and this is a purely product revenue right jeff so flavors and fragrances  million skincare around  million because you covered biossance but skincare includes biossance and neossance where its now called afranova ph our jv with the japanese nikkol chemical and then the vitamins which is about  million for the year so before you get to any of our industrial products youre in about  million in product revenue for  and then the rest will get us bit over to  million because its the polymers the kuraray its the farnesene supplied to novvi and then some other smaller businesses that we have the major of them the  million really covers the heart of our business skincare indiscernible and fragrance jeff osborne and then i imagine it somewhat confidential but the  million to  million in collaboration funding can you just kind of go through in rank order the major partners to get that obviously came in little lower than we were expect in q you mentioned that the timing is difficult to predict but can you just walk through who the top five guys are in kind of order or size or magnitude and then just any color from modeling if thats based on the milestones that you expect to achieve do you think thats more back end loaded in the second half of the year or is there one big item next quarter how should we be thinking about that please john melo let me try to take you through it and i want to highlight jeff we also more are bit disappointed we had everything in place for what we expected in the first quarter and one of our partners nikko bioworks fails to make the milestone payment to us and that’s really the big difference we have in the first quarter so from a delivery standpoint and a technology partnership standpoint we really did everything we expected in the first quarter just wanted you to know that that its not because of a technical mix its actually a failed payment that we are working through but let me take you through what the top looked like so think about farnesene darpa indiscernible pure circle and dsm being our five top collaboration generators and think about all of those being fairly needful there is a couple outliers but they are all north of  million with exception of couple of outliers jeff osborne and then any thoughts on timing just from a modeling perspective should we backend load the year or did you have a line of side that maybe ginkgo comes in q and some other bigger chunky or checks john melo i would say fourth quarter is going to be good but i think the second and third are going to be balanced and the second and third one second jeff you could think of the second and third each around the ish level in collaborations and then obviously a pretty big step out in the fourth quarter really as we become really active with dsm jeff osborne and then i know you highlighted that you produced for value and not units or utilization levels but that being said can you just talk about what the utilization is in brotas currently i think i heard you say you took in underutilization charge but i just wanted to understand how you are looking at running the plant and then also i have a curiosity how was  i assume you switched over to kane and no longer using molasses how was that change over in feed stock john melo ill let kathy talk about the utilization charge let me give you both answers how utilization is looking and then specifically what happened with the switch over to cane syrup the utilization is we are operating around the clock and getting as much up time as we can the only time we are down on the plan is when we are switching from one molecule to another and each molecule switch is call it on average about  days or so five on the front five on the backend and that is to serialize a plant for running another molecule so that’s actually  when we think about downtime of the plan it is all to do with molecule switching i think obviously that matters a lot to us molecules were switching too are very large revenue generators but not significant volume but that’s point one is like when we run pharmacy we are running pharmacy at   up time when were running each molecule running that way what brings upside down our utilization is really when we switch molecules so just keep that in mind i think for the question on the feedstock weve switched over to the syrup everything weve seen so far in the switch has gone very well back to what we expect so i dont expect any major issues and as youve noticed sugar prices are back where they should be so this should be a very good year for us as far as unit costs are in the  or during the season jeff osborne and then the  kathleen do you have a comment on the underutilization charge or so kathy valiasek well its just say about quarteroverquarter so much less than it was in q  indiscernible that as you said that we have to run full stop so it was relatively small compared against  jeff osborne and then the last one i had is just a clarification the restatement of q revenue how much of that flow through in q and if it didnt flow through in q how do we think about that flowing through the pl in  john melo it was zero in q and that the numbers i gave you jeff dont include any of that flowing through i look at that as a bit of a gift its not something we had planned for and therefore the revenue that comes in from that will just be a move from what we had in  to  and we expect that adjustment to come through in the second quarter it will be incremental to what i gave you as are view for second and third quarter collaboration revenue jeff osborne and that indiscernible again is  million to  million in round numbers john melo it was  million operator thank you operator instructions and we have no further questions from our phone line so id now like to turn the conference over to john melo for any closing remarks john melo thank you krystal we promised you in our last call that we expected to complete certain strategic and financial transactions that will have a material impact on our business well change is difficult at times these subsets provided both capital reduced the complexity of our capital structure already reduced our debt by significant amount and improved our balance sheet weve not yet started to communicate the commercial value of the relationship with dsm and that will be forthcoming as dsm and us work through the specifics on products timetomarket and what we will end up doing together we could not be more excited and see it as a significant step forward for our company as well as a healthier planet id like to note that amyris will be hosting its first annual biotech summit tomorrow at our headquarters here at emeryville the summit includes  will include investors partners and key guest speakers and it promises to be an exciting event showcasing our biotech is disrupting high growth markets the primary portion of this

melo thank you peter good afternoon and thank you for joining our call im pleased to have kathleen valiasek our new cfo with us today for those of you we havent met her already she brings a highly regards of skill set critical to taking our business to the next level of growth kathy is focused on delivering on our business outlook and is already helping us drive topline results and improved margins in balance sheet today i will review our results for the quarter and the year review key fourth quarter deliverables that help accelerate our flow update you on our business plans and business model going forward and provide a high level outlook for the years ahead lets start with our results we completed a record year by more than doubling our revenues over  having signed a record number of new global partners and delivered on the  strategic milestones we communicated to you as a result and excluding historical periods we engaged in ethanol sales and trading we posted record revenues in both collaborations and product sales in fact our revenues of  million marked our second consecutive quarter of achieving record revenues which also help underpin record revenues of  million for  overall in addition to the selected revenue performance we had  million of additional sales in our health and nutrition business that we did not have capacity to produce and ship in the fourth quarter and have subsequently shipped in the first quarter we achieved this growth while significantly growing our gross margin and lowering our sga costs by  for the year we believe the combination of this revenue growth margin performance and cost performance is the leading performance in our sector today during the fourth quarter we sold  of our cosmetic ingredient business to nikko chemical for  million and formed a joint venture with them this is in the form of  million upfront with the remaining  million structured as an earnout this business was a business that did not exist four years ago and we built into one of the fastest growing cosmetics ingredient businesses in the sector this business represented less than  of our  revenue and we will be consolidating this into amyris financials going forward nikko is our leading distributor in asia for cosmetic ingredients and we are already benefiting from their expertise as our new joint venture partner we are extracting accelerated growth with their partnership and financial support for this business during the quarter we will also very pleased to announced chevrons equity investment in our novvi joint venture for highperformance renewable base oil technology which is strategically aligned with chevrons aggressive growth plan in lubricants this is another good example of the quality and value of the businesses we built the novvi business is currently valued at around  million and we continued to have a  ownership share while also being the key raw material supplier and a longterm furnishing supply arrangement to novvi in the area of biopharma we are executing well on all three collaborations with top mobile companies in their respective areas on one of these we achieved a key milestone a major drug discover collaboration with this leading company delivering initial development work for new oncology drug development in just months our partner is very impressed that we completed in months where commonly takes years this performance is well beyond their expectations all of our collaborations performed well in the fourth quarter and we were pleased during the december to announce a multiyear extension to our collaboration agreement with kuraray for the use of amyris biofene in liquid farnesene rubber and farnesenebased elastomer applications kuraray recently announced that sumitomo rubber industries has adopted liquid farnesene rubber as a performance enhancing additive for use of the production of its latest winter tire the winter maxx  kuraray has indicated tire launch has performed better than expected they have already indicated double the demand than we expected for  we believe sumitomo is the first of what could be several global tire brands that end up using liquid farnesene rubber as a performance enhancing tire additive many of you have asked about the status of the mou we announced october   with a leading global food ingredients and nutraceuticals partner we have advanced to a signed contract resulting in  million in  revenues for licensing agreement related to the mou after completing an evaluation we decided that a share swap for ownership in their china fermentation facility was not the best use of our equity and not the best way for us to create shareholder value let me now update you on our strategy our business plan and our business model we are leading the industrialization of the synthetic biology and we believe have developed an advantage business model that more than double our revenue in  and expect to more than double our revenue product revenue in  and continually improve our gross margin we are applying innovative science to make our planet healthier both the planet itself and the people on it we are doing this by making high performing where chemistry accessible to everyone we are the lowest cost producer of some of the most desired chemistry by the worlds leading companies in their respective segments we are achieving the holy grail for our customers of producing the lowest cost highest quality and pure the material they can source we are making it plentiful and at stable prices without volatility we have succeeded in scaling and meeting our customers targets for all the products we develop with our collaboration agreements todate we have a clear pipeline to scale three to four products a year over the next five to ten years as a result of the traction we are experiencing and the clarity of our business model we made the following strategic moves first we are focusing our efforts on collaborations and expanding our relationships with existing partners this is a solution oriented approach for customers business challenges and is all about deep customer intimacy and a very focused analytical approach to a few targets in each of our key sectors this has resulted in us reducing our exposure some of our product selling efforts and as you have seen through the nikko joint venture and reducing our position in novvi joint venture we will remain a key supplier to these businesses but the sales capability and channel management will be in the joint ventures or with our partners we are managing our business by focusing on three clear market sectors when we have the most advantage technology clearly and extensive product pipeline and some of the leading companies in these sectors as partners our three sectors are health and nutrition health and nutrition represented  of  revenue and grew  over  revenue in health and nutrition we have the biopharma business which is partnered with the three of the worlds leading pharma companies the vitamin business which is all about vitamin e and vitamin a and the sweeteners business which is all about a sugar replacement which is really playing into a  billion market opportunity when we have advantage technology second sector is the personal care sector where it delivered  of our  revenue and grew  over  in personal care we have fragrances which are partnered with firmenich givaudan and takasago we have flavors which are partnered with firmenich and givaudan we have cosmetic access that have partnered with givaudan and our new joint venture partner nikko our next last segment is performance materials performance materials represented  of  revenue and excluding fuels grew by  over  the renewable fuels part was  of our total revenue in  and less than  of our total revenue in  now on to our third point over  of our revenue is generated from our top  customers as we look ahead to  and beyond this profile improves to about  we have a partnership model where we enable significant competitive advantage for our partners and share in the value this creates longterm we do real business with our partners and deliver real solutions that generate revenue today and will into the future we are not building a portfolio of bets that we hope someday deliver revenue we apply  our fourth point we apply our innovative science where customers have identified a clear product target the target is replacing a supply source from an existing market that is well understood and is growing faster and current supplies and support from either a volume or pricing perspective partners pay us to develop they identify a cost and quality target that enables significant competitive advantage for them we develop we scale and produce the product and they formulate integrate and deliver to the final customer when customers have skin in the game they select products that really matter to them and they ensure these products generate significant value we both win we amyris dont have research product selection or market risk and our partners grow market share at a lower cost i could point we double down where we believe our technology is delivering bestinclass performance and where we view the market opportunity justifies investment beyond the partner funding the high intensity sweetener market is a good example we have successfully made a high intensity sweetener from nontmo brazilian sugarcane syrup that is  times sweeter than sugar without the calories and with visibility on achieving cost equivalency with sugar we are currently achieving cost in this product that are in line with the purest molecules available from stevia but without the supply limitations we are doing this security levels that dont have the typical after taste from these type of products some of the worlds leading soda companies have told us this is the holy grail of sweeteners we are very excited about this product in our pipeline and our partner on this project is collaborating with us to get this product into the brands and make the world healthier for all we believe the opportunity for this product is to replace or reduce sugar and we believe this opportunity has available market at about  million or think of it as about half the current global sugar market these five strategic segments are being executed today inside of amyris and were key to our revenue and margin performance in  this continued strong growth is only starting to our business and our partners our business model has been a key enabler in growing our collaborations and providing shortterm cash short and longterm revenue growth and longterm gross margin expansion the three components of our business model are first collaborations our partners fund the development of key ingredients to support their business strategy this funding more than pays for our rd organization and provides us early cash cover as we scale products for a propose this is our early margin and cost advantage we generated over  million in partner payments in  and expect to maintain the strong performance level in our collaboration revenue for the next three to five years which is consistent with our previously stated levels of annual collaboration revenue second component we produced and sell the products we develop through our partners in general we sell most in a small margin to ensure our longterm sustainability and the third component we have a value share mechanism where our partners share a portion of the value created from our products the combination of the value share and the initial product margin generate over  gross margin at steady state production that means after its scaled and stable in the market for a year for the personal care and health and nutrition sectors and around  margin for the performance material sector with a record of new partners contracted in  the extensive pipeline of products with these partners and the continued expansion of products with our existing partners we now have over  of our expected revenue through  supported by our current customer relationships and product portfolio in  we transition as a company for meeting more demand to be in sold out and needing to execute a clear production capacity roadmap to keep up with our customers needs we have developed this production roadmap and we are in a position to keep up with our customers needs through a combination of partner funded and supported projects and bndes project financing in brazil we will continue to have challenges like the fourth quarter where we have  million more in sales than what we could share we believe this is manageable and a good problem to have in summary we are proud of our  results and expect  will be another great year for amyris with more than doubling of product revenue while maintaining our strong collaboration performance we also plan to continue to improve our balance sheet and post improved product margins as cost improvements and as our value share payments continue to grow now let me turn to kathy for a detailed review of our financial results and then i will end with a high level outlook for the company kathleen valiasek thank you john and good afternoon everyone after my first two weeks here at amyris im truly excited by the opportunities ahead of us and quite compressed by the level of commitment our customer have to amyris and how critical our technology is to their business its rare to experience the level of the tendency our customers had on our technology together we had a mutually successful relationship amyris has embarked on an era of significant growth across its business we are executing on our plan to effectively harness it to grow our company and build shareholder value this is creating unprecedented demand for new partners and the potential expansion with existing partners with the positive cycle that is building on a great track record of success in scaling and delivering products to our customers that have a positive impact on their bottomline this impact is why we are constantly being approached by leading companies to solve their supply chain problems and at times consider interesting strategic transactions more on this later when john provides color on our outlook all of this is aligning to support increased revenues and our ability to operate from a position of strength in running our business and executing on improvements in our balance sheet and capital structure now let me take you through our fourth quarter results fourth quarter revenues were  million and were up  over  million for the fourth quarter of  as a testament to the strength in our portfolio this performance was driven by both product sales and collaborations growth over the prior years quarter product sales of  million were up  over  million for the fourth quarter of  this was driven by growth across our three focused sectors personal care performance materials and health and nutrition in health and nutrition the key driver of this growth were farnesene shipments in denver for vitamin e and in our personal care business shipments of our second fragrance molecule during the quarter and continued strong performance of our cosmetic ingredients business and our cosmetics active partnership with givaudan significant quantities of farnesene were also shipped to our joint venture partner novvi for base oils and lubricants in the kuraray for liquid farnesene rubber or lfr in car tires going into  we are seeing stronger than experienced demand from kuraray due to request from their customers and we feel the adoption of lfr by other tire companies is a key growth opportunity for amyris collaboration revenues of  million were driven by the aforementioned  million related to mou related partner actually  million from hitting a milestone with darpa and the reminder from biogen firmenich and the global food ingredients supplier we announced collaboration with in july of  collaboration revenues were up  over  million for fourth quarter of  in line with increasing demand we continue to work diligently to solve our capacity constraints because clear roadmap for continued expansion supported by our partners and in the nearterm assets to financing the bndes in brazil for a planned buildout of a dedicated flavors and fragrances plant adjacent to our brotas plant adjusted gross profit which excludes depreciation inventory provisions and excess capacity charges was  million up from about  for q  adjusted gross profit benefited from a significant component of high margin collaborations revenue during the quarter as well as a favorable product mix especially given just under  in fuel sales during the quarter as we fully transitioned our business away from commodity products adjusted gross margin showed a significant improvement at  compared to just under  for q  this will continue to improve as we benefit from less scale of a cost in our cost of goods sold for new molecules and the continued growth in the value shared component of our business model operating expenses  excuse me such a large increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter selling general and administrative expenses of  million declined slightly compared to the same period last year rd expenses increased to support our collaborations activity adjusted operating expenses representing combined rd and sga expenses excluding stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization were  million this primarily reflected investment in rd supporting a diversity of new collaborations in  and was up from  million for the fourth quarter of  net loss for the fourth quarter of  was  million or  per basic and diluted share included in the net loss were several noncash items including a gain from changes in fair value of embedded derivatives and impairment losses these items totaled  million this compared with a reported net loss of  million or  per basic and  per diluted share for the fourth quarter of  which primarily included an impairment charge of  million which was offset by a gain on fair value of derivatives of about the same amount adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of  excluding these items and stockbased compensation was  million or  per basic share this compared with an adjusted net loss of  million or  per share for the same period a year ago during the fourth quarter we successfully closed on the  million unsecured credit facility and an additional  million in equity funding from nectar our nutraceuticals partner which is converting our farnesene into vitamin e we also completed our neossance asset divestment via our nikko joint venture and received  million from nikko exclosing with the remaining  million expected to be paid over three years on the remaining cash profits contributed to nikko from the jv in addition nikko provided working capital from the jv of  million these are both great examples of how our pipelines have become critical partner funding needs in the short and mediumterm there is a strong codependency in the relationship with our partners as our technology that comes critical enabler of their business we are experiencing this type of support and expansion of our partners portfolio this is another great example of our technology leadership in our sector we have mentioned on prior calls our desire to support partner generated financing where possible when cash is needed to fund working capital to grow the business which we have accomplished this aligns our partners interest even more so with our longterm focus when equity financing is involved puts the ownership in longterm loyal hands ahead of vested interest from a variety of standpoints in making sure our business does well these activities during the fourth quarter generated a significant amount of cash leading to cash and restricted cash totaling  million at december   this is the highest level since q  just before the end of the quarter we entered into a definitive agreement to complete another milestone we promised by resolving our nearterm debt maturity issue by pushing  million of debt out which we completed in january of  this included  million of notes previously due march  but is now extended to april  in addition  million senior secured debt held by stegodon corporation via our partners ginkgo bioworks previously due february  has been extended to october  this has greatly improved our nearterm liquidity and puts amyris in significantly better position to continue to improve our capital structure this is not the last step but really the most recent in improving our balance sheet in  amyris set the stage for success and delivered today our business portfolio is strongly positioned and highly diversified and growing at a rapid cliff looking forward i am even more excited by the growth opportunity at top before joining the company this opportunity is ours to win and we are on a positive role and simply need to execute to deliver another great year for  now i will turn the call back to john john melo thanks kathy in  we fully transitioned our business beyond biofuels while delivering record revenues for the year we delivered on all of our milestones and positioned the company for continued strong revenue growth today i can say that i have never been more confident in our competitive position and i believe we will continue to role at about the current rate with the existing partners and the product portfolio they have contracted us to develop and produce for them during the fourth quarter we saw several new and exciting strategic opportunities develop for the company from potential partners who approached us as a result of the competitive advantage we demonstrated in key markets we are in very active discussions and expect one of these relationships to advance during the second quarter this will have a material positive impact on our shortterm results and is expected to provide us with the necessary resources to further accelerate our growth let me summarize our high level outlook first we ended the year with over  million annual revenue run rate and we expect to continue the current level of growth for  secondly we communicated the framework of doubling product revenue annually and maintaining our strong performance in collaborations we are on track to deliver more than doubling product revenue in  and maintaining our framework for collaboration revenue and are happy to report there are current customers and product relationships support more than  of this product revenue growth thirdly our business model and sales strategy is clear and focused around three core sectors health and nutrition personal care and performance materials this is where our growth is coming from and we can continue to deliver strong growth while lowering our margins in these markets with our current product and customer portfolio fourthly we are in very active discussions with several significant strategic growth opportunities for one of these core segments successful completion of one of these relationships will have a material positive impact on our revenue growth and balance sheet we believe that we are the only company in our sector that has now successfully developed and scaled several products for our customers and is delivering significant revenue and margin growth from these products we executed on delivering on our key objectives for  and are on track for another great year in  we are doing real business with customers representing leadership in each of our target sectors this is delivering real revenue growth while having a positive impact on the health of our planet and making accessible amazing chemistry for use in mainstream products the total available market for our target sectors in current product portfolio is about  billion that more than underpins our growth base on being the advanced technology in many of these opportunities i would like to thank our teams in emeryville and brazil our investors and our partners for making such a great year possible and ultimately supporting the mission of amyris we are delivering the leading performance in our sector record revenue growth declining costs and the leading partner portfolio to support the strength of sustainability of our company we have industrialized synthetic biology and have become a force for good for our partners and our planet i would now like to open the lines for any questions you may have keith can you help us questionandanswer session operator absolutely sir operator instructions our first question comes from the line of thomas boyes of cowen and company your question please thomas boyes yes just a couple of quick questions from me the first we have seen an uptick in branding for your cosmetics and i was just wondering how we could think about opex trends going forward given those efforts john melo we dont have kathy jumpin on this we do not see a significant opex change in our side specifically for that business we are dependent on our channel partner who is doing a terrific job sephora and based on what weve seen in the first quarter which has been a great result so far we expect to not see again a significant change kathy anything kathleen valiasek no i completely agree last year with indiscernible was ramping up costs i would say in opex but now i feel as john said that because of sephora we will be able to be fairly flat with opex in biossance for  thomas boyes got it and then just the last one just given some of the expansion commentary that you had i was wondering in broad terms you could talk about the brotas facility and may be some of the utilization rates are around that what we should think about that going forward john melo sure the brotas facility is pretty hard to ever consider exit to utilization rates because of the way we are operating it today right its basically we are switching from products to make sure we can deliver our customers the lowest cost possible for the products they are looking for as a result when are we operating a specific product whether thats making farnesene making tool making spirit all making whatever we decide to make there the utilization and the up time for those cycles is outstanding what happens though is every time we switch were actually down for that period of time so that the net impact is that we are probably under utilizing the site by  to  thats possible there because of these switchouts in product i think kathy referenced we have a design now in place weve actually already broken ground on a second site that will be a purpose built site for our ingredients business for the flavors for the cosmetics and for the fragrance ingredients and also the health products and i think with that site us running the growth is one allout we will be in the mid s to up or  utilization of the site which is exactly what we would expect for site of that type operator thank you our next question comes from amit dayal of rodman  renshaw your line is open amit dayal thank you and good afternoon john and kathy how are you guys john melo very good amit good to hear you amit dayal just wanted to clarify your comments on this nutraceutical customer you said the mou didnt translate into definitive agreement yet were supplying product to could you clarify what the situation is and if we can expect revenues from this nutraceutical customer in  john melo yes i would expect different revenue profile then we had communicated in the mou and the mou we had said there is going to be revenue but there is going to be no margin and overtime well improve the products and hopefully get to margin actually as a result of where we ended up the discussion i expect we will have shortterm revenue but that revenue will be profitable and will be about products that accord their business rather than just a passthrough for our business amit dayal got it and how this the  million was all bracketed under product revenues from these guys john melo no if we say license fee so it will be in the collaboration dollar market amit dayal understood i may have missed this i know you provided some color on the capacity expansion plans did you give a number on what the capex or investment going into some of these efforts are going to be john melo i think kathy can talk to this our  the funding for the site will be a combination of a partner funding as well as bndes debt and the total funding between the two will be somewhere around the  million range but again were looking to finalizing that but the important message is were not expecting that to be either a new equity or direct funded outside of the amyris balance sheet or inside our balance sheet kathy kathleen valiasek yes i think you grow faster recently had a meeting with them and i know that went very well we broke ground and its a great facility to finance the stability john melo great something we have not spoken a lot about the business case based on the products we expect to transfer into that site because frankly those are products either doing now at brotas  or what well doing this year or in the next couple of years at cmo so were basically transferring stuff we are making and will be making when you put the products inside of our plant brotas  we have about a one year or less payback on that site so we have not had a big issue with the level of interest people participating in that site what they have been very focused on is making sure we have the right longterm partner so that were maximizing value from that site brotas  amit dayal understood in relation to the blended gross margin you are seeing now with this level of revenue mix should we continue to expect you know these  plus sort of margins going forward if collaboration in product revenues can you remain at similar levels going forward kathleen valiasek yes we absolutely do as john described in a little bit more detail on our call today we value share our business model which includes the value share at the end really makes a significant difference on our gross margins and the truth of it is in   in  we really didnt see it very much in  its extremely impactful i mean the actual that we would say for  was  and thats for  and then  was around  but in  its significant amit dayal got it and just may be a last question for me john you commentary around some of these strategic discussions you are having with potential catalyst coming up in the second quarter is this just one discussion you are having or these multiple discussions you are having and one of them could materialize in the second quarter john melo we are in multiple discussions its a competitive parcels for multiple companies are looking at the same market area and the kind of scale that we are talking about is very material for us as a company right i expect there will be one because we are talking to multiple about the same end markets and it will be a very material agreement for our company amit dayal understood i was thinking of it in line with maybe separate discussions for may be different product lines or molecules et cetera but it looks like its just one of sort of initiative with a multiple discussions around that one project i guess is that correct john melo yes to give you some color i mean we obviously have many more pursuits and discussions going on in kind of the normal course of business and im not highlighting those leaving those its just our activity to deliver on our growth for the year this particular one im referencing these are several strategics that have approached us about a specific opportunity in our portfolio that is now in market that is quite strategic for those companies so thats why im referencing first of all highlighting it secondly referencing it and then also making clear that the result is that were going to end up with four five new players around that particular segment that we are actually doing it yield for one of these two to be the right partner to be the right partner selected to be able to operate with us in this particular product area amit dayal understood and this is not factored into any of your guidance right john melo no we actually thats one reason and we debated this a lot one reason why we decided not to really go change or make a big deal out of guidance for  until we get this deal done and then we can actually update pretty complete what the guidance looks like going forward in more detail operator thank you our next question comes from lisa springer of singular research your question please lisa springer good afternoon john and kathy and congratulations on a nice growth for the year john melo thanks lisa kathleen valiasek thanks lisa springer regarding the revenue breakdown you gave us for  with the contributions from health and nutrition personal care and performance materials are you expecting those to change significantly in  or should we anticipate a very similar revenue breakdown john melo the  in health and nutrition was pretty outstanding right so im not sure lisa springer yes john melo but i think that kind of mixed and obviously health and nutrition really leading growth is something you can expect in  lisa springer okay and the assumptions a little bit that you gave about product sales for  is that based on a ramp up of products you are already producing or do you expect there is going to be new products to go into production in  john melo yes there are three new products coming into production in  those are not having a material impact in total revenue in  i think about the majority of the product revenue in  are products we started selling in  we are working for this but  products we started in  are having the most material impact in revenue for  lisa springer okay okay and the sweetener you referenced in the call i wonder if you could give us a little more color around that in terms of where that is in terms of the development timeline john melo we are planning an investor day around our annual meeting here in emeryville and during that we are going to actually share quite a bit what i can tell you is obviously i said during the call that we are producing it now at about the same cost as the plant material we think that the real tipping point to convert the sugar market into high intensity sweeteners is being priced competitively with the sugar equivalent and we believe that in the next  to  months we will actually be at exactly that price level operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of carter driscoll of fbr your line is open natemitchell hey this is nate mitchell on for carter thanks for taking my questions first question related to working cap i understand the strategy is to source this from partners but how much do you think how much working cap do you expect for the business to need on a of percentage basis how much would you expect that to come from your partners john melo tough question meaning we havent thought of it that way but ill give you sort of a  give you a way to think of it which is our  we had a huge ramp in  i think because of the way the cycle the total product cycle is builtin we dont expect that same kind of ramp in  for working capital and i would say that over half of what we expect in  will be partner based funding for working capital natemitchell okay thank you i mean kind of building off of lisas question how do you expect there is three buckets in terms of percentage revenue health and nutrition personal care and materials in the longerterm talking two three five year how do you see those evolving overtime do you see one kind of taking over just any additional color on there would be great john melo sure if i can you give you around  so not going way far out but around  you could think about around  about   to  coming out of health nutrition about  to  out of personal care and then the rest divided between collaboration revenue and performance material that kind gives you the sense of shape as we look at the business growth going forward nate mitchell awesome thats all i had for now thanks guys john melo great thank you operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the call over mr melo for any closing remarks sir john melo well keith thank you very much i appreciate your help like to thank everyone for joining our call today and your support of amyris we are really looking forward to  and obviously already off to a great start i like to note that will be participating number of investor outreach activities in the coming months to meet with investors and share our story and we hope to have a chance to meet with many of you as we do that and again as i said in may during our annual meeting we except to turn the annual meeting to much more of a shareholder and investor engagement of that we expect to have a few guest speakers including some of our customers and really to get into a lot more detail about our sectors customers behind those sectors and how our business is growing so i hope to see many of you at that time thank you very much and look forward to see you in the near future operator thank you sir and thank you ladies
