properties ii inc is a maryland corporation that incorporated on july   and intends to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ending december   or the first year in which we commence material operations we are externally managed and advised by chp ii advisors llc our advisor is responsible for managing our daytoday affairs and for identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf we had no operations prior to the commencement of our primary offering our investment focus is on acquiring a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate or real estaterelated assets primarily in the united states within the seniors housing medical office postacute care and acute care asset classes the types of seniors housing that we may acquire include active adult communities agerestricted and agetargeted housing independent and assisted living facilities continuing care retirement communities and memory care facilities the types of medical office properties that we may acquire include medical office buildings specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities surgery centers outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other facilities designed for clinical services the types of postacute care facilities that we may acquire include skilled nursing facilities longterm acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitative facilities the types of acute care facilities that we may acquire include general acute care hospitals and specialty surgical hospitals we view manage and evaluate our portfolio homogeneously as one collection of healthcare assets with a common goal of maximizing revenues and property income regardless of the asset class or asset type we are committed to investing the proceeds of our primary offering through strategic investment types aimed to maximize stockholder value by generating sustainable cash flow growth and increasing the value of our healthcare assets we generally expect to lease seniors housing properties to whollyowned trs entities and engage independent thirdparty managers under management agreements to operate the properties as permitted under ridea structures however we may also lease our properties to thirdparty tenants under triplenet or similar lease structures where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs including cost increases for real estate taxes utilities insurance and ordinary repairs medical office postacute care and acute care properties will be leased on a triplenet net or modified gross basis to thirdparty tenants in addition we expect most investments will be wholly owned although we may invest through partnerships with other entities where we believe it is appropriate and beneficial we expect to invest in a combination of stabilized assets new property developments and properties which have not reached full stabilization finally we also may invest in and originate mortgage bridge or mezzanine loans or in entities that make investments similar to the foregoing investment types we generally make loans to the owners of properties to enable them to acquire land buildings or to develop property in exchange the owner generally grants us a first lien or collateralized interest in a participating mortgage collateralized by the property or by interests in the entity that owns the property pursuant to the terms of our primary offering offering proceeds were held in escrow until we met the minimum offering amount of  million we broke escrow in our primary offering effective july   through the sale of  class a shares to our advisor for  million which was sufficient to satisfy the minimum offering amount in all states where we are conducting our public offering except ohio pennsylvania and washington market opportunities and trends we believe that medical care will continue to grow rapidly and steadily for two basic reasonsit is an essential human service for an aging demographic and it is heavily supported by the government these factors may result in healthcarerelated property investments potentially experiencing less economic volatility than other sectors in addition there are indications that significant opportunities for consolidation exist in the seniors housing and healthcare facility sectors which we believe will create value as our portfolio grows and achieves scale through asset aggregation a bank of america merrill lynch global research report entitled healthcare reits a defensive play on aging demographics dated september   the bofa report estimates that the total value of healthcarerelated real estate ranges from  billion to over  trillion with reit ownership accounting for only about  of the total this continued ownership fragmentation of the healthcare property industry provides adequate opportunity for growth through consolidation opportunities the specific trends and characteristics unique to the healthcare sector and the asset classes on which we focus are described in greater detail below demand drivers for healthcare property the primary drivers behind demand for seniors housing medical office acute care and postacute care properties are the aging of the us population and growth in national healthcare expenditures expanded healthcare insurance coverage as the us population over the age of  increases more americans become entitled to medicare to cover their increasing healthcare needs and related costs in addition under the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act and other legislation healthcare insurance coverage has expanded in recent years to cover more of the nonelderly lower income populations according to the national center for health statistics less than  percent of the population did not have health insurance coverage at the beginning of  down from  percent at the time the affordable care act passed in  the resulting expansion of us healthcare insurance coverage has created an increase in demand for healthcare services and healthcare facilities of all types there is a risk however that the affordable care act could be repealed in the future and may be replaced with new legislation the effects of which are unknown at this time the impact of repealing existing legislation or introducing new legislation could materially increase the uninsured population in the us who are not able to obtain or afford health insurance coverage we believe efforts to preserve and increase access to care will remain a primary focus of the new administration the aging of america according to a december  report of the us census bureau  people in the united states will turn  every day until  most recent us census bureau projections as of december  estimate that by   million americans  or  of the us population will be  years or older compared to  of the population in  an anticipated increase of  in the senior population between  and  the graph below depicts the projected increase in the size of the senior population in the united states over time based upon national population projections by the us census bureau image removed source us census bureau december  disability is defined under the ada as a substantial limitation in a major life activity research indicates that age is positively correlated with the presence of a physical disability and the oldest people have the highest levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities with the increasing age of the us population the healthcare system faces an increase in the population with agerelated physical and cognitive disabilities which require increased supportive health care services as well as housing options for older adults additionally we expect an increased demand for healthcare facilities providing physician and ancillary care services for such disabilities rising healthcare expenditures the rise in the aging population the expansion of us healthcare insurance coverage through medicare or other means and medical technology innovations contribute to increasing healthcare expenditures national healthcare spending is projected to increase from approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp in  to

an additional  years up from an average of  additional years for those aged  in   a net gain of  years americans  years and older have longer life expectancies than the elderly did in the past and will therefore need additional housing options to accommodate their special needs as they age demand for seniors housing options is currently outpacing the existing supply of seniors housing units according to the asha special issue brief a projection of demand for market rate us seniors housing  american seniors housing association winter  the projected annual demand growth for seniors housing will increase as baby boomers pass the over agethreshold after  increasing from the level of  units per year from  to  to a demand of  units per year from  to  the asha special issue brief projects

demand for market rate us seniors housing  american seniors housing association winter  the supply growth of certain seniors housing asset classes over the last decade declined following a boom in seniors housing development in the s since  there has been modest growth in the total national inventory of seniors housing units according to national investment center for seniors housing  care nic data with a compound annual growth rate of  for seniors housing facilities as of the end of  however the number of new seniors housing units under construction is increasing muted supply growth has

housing units grew by  units this growth in inventory has contributed to a decline in overall occupancy by  percentage points from year end  we believe seniors housing development will remain at an acceptable level given the growth in aging demographics and that sufficient demand exists to absorb the new development units over time rise in the prevalence of alzheimers disease according to a study funded by the alzheimers association and nihnational institute on aging the number of people in the us with alzheimers disease may nearly triple by  straining our healthcare system and taxing the resources of caregivers barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or slow the disease approximately  million people age  and older are projected to have alzheimers disease by  the following graph depicts the projected rise in the number of senior population with alzheimers disease in the us broken down by three age groups source hebert le weuve j scherr pa evans da alzheimer disease in the united states  estimated using the  census  according to a national center for health statistics data brief dated november  in  approximately  of individuals living in residential care communities had alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia we believe that the projected rise in the incidence of alzheimers disease creates a need for seniors housing options that address the specialized needs of alzheimers and other dementia patients and their families which often cannot be addressed in a traditional home setting stronger us housing market as the broader economy recovers and the us residential real estate market strengthens it is widely believed that the demand for seniors housing will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement and transitions to active adult communities and other seniors housing facilities seniors often sell their homes and use the proceeds to pay rent in privatepay retirement communities creating a strong correlation between seniors housing demand and home prices according to data from a december  report from the joint center for housing studies of harvard university the joint center report the number of households headed by seniors will increase more than  over the next two decades as the senior population ages into their late s and this segment of the population grows they tend to seek more accessible and convenient living options the joint center report states the sheer growth in the older population will mean the number of renter households will expand from  to more than  million households over the next two decades overall the share of renters will increase slightly from  percent of older households in  to  percent in  seniors housing and postacute care asset classes based on the above fundamentals and perceived trends we may invest in or develop the following classes of seniors housing and postacute care properties seniors housing communities active adult communities active adult communities offer social and recreationalcentered living in a setting that may include town homes condominiums cluster homes manufactured housing single family homes and multifamily housing these communities are generally classified as either independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily rental or ownership condominium housing with central dining facilities that provide residents as part of a monthly fee meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation social and recreational activities assisted living facilities assisted living facilities are usually stateregulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide in a majority of the units supportive care from trained employees to residents who are unable to live independently and require assistance with activities of daily living the additional services may include assistance with bathing dressing eating and administering medications continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities offer agerestricted seniors housing facilities with a combination of independent living lifestyle options for individuals who do not need constant physician or nursing supervision and assisted living or skilled nursing facilities available to residents on the same or adjacent property of the complex this type of community generally offers a longer term contract for seniors that provides for housing services and nursing care with varying payment plans that may include entrance fees and condominium or cooperative rental programs in general these properties provide residential living in an apartmentstyle building with services and dining usually on the main level in addition those in a campuslike setting of several acres may offer other individual multifamily homes and offer amenities that may be similar to those found in an active adult community memory carealzheimers facilities those suffering from the effects of alzheimers disease or other forms of memory loss need specialized care memory carealzheimers centers provide the specialized care for this population including residential housing and assistance with the activities of daily living postacute care properties skilled nursing facilities a skilled nursing facility generally provides the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital and also provides custodial care and assistance with the activities of daily living skilled nursing facilities differ from other seniors housing facilities in that they also provide a high level of medical care a licensed physician supervises each patients care and a nurse or other medical professional is almost always on the premises skilled nursing care is available on site usually  hours a day other medical professionals such as occupational or physical therapists are also available this allows the delivery of medical procedures and therapies on site that would not be possible in other housing options longterm acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals or ltachs are certified as acute care hospitals but focus on patients who on average stay more than  days many of the patients in ltachs are transferred from a hospitalbased intensive or critical care unit ltachs specialize in treating patients who may have more than one serious condition but who may improve with time and care and eventually return home services provided in ltachs typically include comprehensive rehabilitation respiratory therapy head trauma treatment and pain management inpatient rehabilitative facilities inpatient rehabilitative facilities are licensed facilities that provide intensive rehabilitation programs to patients who typically have complex medical issues resulting from incidents of trauma or strokes they focus on providing high levels of physical occupational and speech therapy under the supervision of highly trained medical doctors staff and therapists medical office building and acute care property supply and demand demographics and existing space the increased demand for medical office buildings acute care and postacute care properties is also supported by an aging population and increased health insurance coverage as americans  years and older have longer life expectancies than in the past their need for health related services is projected to increase the need for additional healthcare properties in  persons over age  were  percent of the us population but accounted for  percent of physician visits in the us according to the  national ambulatory medical care survey individuals over age  made an average of  visits to physicians offices in  or  times the number of visits made by individuals under  years of age the graph below depicts the average number of physicians visits in the us by age group in  source cdcnchs national ambulatory medical care survey  evolution of the us healthcare model rising healthcare costs create pressure within the healthcare industry to move from an inpatient to an outpatient delivery setting in order to provide service more efficiently and contain costs the outpatient model of healthcare services results in declining hospital admissions and overnight stays with a focus toward performing certain procedures and diagnostic services in a more consumercentric costeffective setting according to the urban land institute report almost  of all surgeries today do not require an overnight hospital stay compared with only  of all surgeries in  technology advances are also driving patient demand for more medical services and the space in which to deliver them the shift to outpatient surgeries also continues to be encouraged by technological advances that involve smaller incisions improved anesthetics less risk of infection and faster recoveries the increase in outpatient procedures drives greater demand for medical office buildings and other healthcare properties in which such procedures can be performed the following graph depicts the increase in outpatient surgeries vs inpatient surgeries in the united states under the new evolving us healthcare model image removed source trendwatch chartbook  american hospital association consumerdriven healthcare model todays patients often select their doctors based not only on the quality of care offered but also on the ease of access to such doctors hospitals are therefore expanding into communitybased settings and encouraging large practices to open satellite offices according to the medical office research report published by marcus  millichap in  this bodes well for medical office building owners as many providers including physician practices affiliated with or owned by major health systems will favor welllocated multitenant medical office buildings particularly those with tenant rosters that promote crossreferrals at the same time however some share of tenant demand will be diverted to storefront clinics and large ambulatory care centers medical office buildings and acute care property asset classes based on the increased numbers of insured americans increased healthcare visits by a growing aging us population and an evolving us healthcare model driving a need for additional healthcare properties we may invest in or develop the following classes of medical office buildings acute care properties and other healthcarerelated properties medical office buildings these properties include traditional medical office buildings specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities surgery centers outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other facilities designated for clinical services the buildings may be located on the campus of a hospital adjacent to campus or as a hub and spoke location whereby the hospital desires to establish a presence in a particular market medical office buildings may also be unaffiliated with a health system and could be multitenant or singletenant in nature acute care properties these properties include specialty hospitals which are primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of patients having a cardiac or orthopedic condition or patients undergoing a surgical procedure general acute care hospitals also fall within the category of acute care properties and offer a variety of services including operating and recovery rooms imaging and diagnostic services delivery and neonatal care oncology services clinical laboratory services physical therapy and other outpatient services other healthcarerelated properties other healthcarerelated properties in which we believe there are opportunities based on current supply and demand factors are pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturing facilities laboratories lifescience and research facilities liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of capital is expected to be the net proceeds that we receive from our offering we will use such amounts for investments in properties and other permitted investments as well as the payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses relating to the selection acquisition and development of properties and other permitted investments generally once we make investments we expect to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions from our cash flows from operations and we expect to meet cash needs for acquisitions from net proceeds from our offering and borrowings however until such time as we are fully invested we may use proceeds from our offering andor borrowings to pay all or a portion of our operating expenses distributions and debt service we intend to strategically leverage our real estate assets and use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of properties and the diversification of our portfolio our ability to increase our diversification through borrowings could be adversely affected by credit market conditions which could result in lenders reducing or limiting funds available for loans including loans collateralized by real estate we may also be negatively impacted by rising interest rates on any unhedged variable rate debt or the timing of when we seek to refinance existing debt during times when interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on a timely basis we may
