cofounder dr joseph rubinfeld to advisory board nov   73 et from amarantus biosciences inc sunnyvale calif nov   prnewswire  amarantus biosciences inc otcqb ambs a biotechnology company developing new treatments and diagnostics for parkinsons disease and traumatic brain injury centered on its proprietary antiapoptosis therapeutic protein manf today announced that it has appointed amgen cofounder joseph rubinfeld phd to its corporate advisory board dr rubinfeld will assist management in positioning the companys development programs for partnering as well as provide guidance on manfbased small molecule strategies with his extensive medicinal chemistry background i believe in manf said dr rubinfeld i have reviewed a great number of technologies in my  year career in the biopharmaceutical field and i believe that manf could be one of the biggest successes that i have ever seen the fundamental scientific premise of reducing protein misfolding is basic yet very profound the data while early demonstrates very clearly at the cellular level and in animals that manf reduces apoptosis improves cellular function and restores behavioural deficits in a number of disease models including parkinsons stroke myocardial infarction and traumatic brain injury these are all indications with very large markets and clear unmet medical need i believe that if we are able to further derisk manf with positive toxicology studies and early clinical data the companys new orphan drug strategy could get manf to market rather expeditiously manf has the commercial potential to become a blockbuster
