develops and implements strategic plans for the banks mortgage lending personal banking and other business lines vincent liuzzi strives to create multiservice relationships to meet customers diverse and changing banking needs when shopping for a mortgage most customers have the choice between a bank and a mortgage company banks offer a number of advantages in this situation particularly for customers with stable financial records banks often offer baseline interest rates that are competitive with mortgage companies and others in the industry as competition for borrowers tends to affect lenders across the board however because a bank is competing with other lenders for its customers business it may use the persons financial history and knowledge of his or her needs to offer a more attractive package banks may offer a customer special consideration for needs that may not concern a more impersonal lender for example a borrower with recently accrued education debt could be considered a risk to a large mortgage broker whereas the same persons community bank may see this as an investment in his or her future and offer a better rate the bank can also explain the details and terminology used in the mortgage process and present information in a way that is not only understandable but also helpful to the borrower in making decisions alrlri cooperative project rapidly

ropes of community banking and what the move to dnb first means for him the community and chester county’s community bank’s future vista today let’s start at the beginning where did you grow up vince vince liuzzi i was born and raised los angeles in california my dad was born in elizabeth new jersey and moved to los angeles as a young boy with his family in the ’s my grandfather was very community minded and entrepreneurial he was a small business owner before opening up a barber shop that he owned for many years into retirement he had a small ice cream parlor and then a fruit and nuts shop when he became a barber he built up his business cutting the hair of a lot of tv or movie actors in the sherman oaks area eventually he became known as the “barber to the stars” i grew up in a big italian community and went to catholic grade school and high school the area where we lived was dominated by the aerospace industry at the time vt how did you get into banking vl in  when i was a senior in high school i enrolled in a banking internship program sponsored by security pacific national bank the experience gave me a chance to experience the different functions of working in a bank branch teller proof and cash box new accounts loans everything after high school i got my first full time banking job at security pacific national bank consumer credit department in chatsworth vt what did you take from that first job you still remember today vl the experience as an intern and then regular employee at security pacific was an important foundational experience for me because i did a little of everything in the bank i experienced all the various components of banking   i learned the importance of customer service client segmentation and gained a deeper understanding of consumer behaviors and how the financial services business supports growth consumer asset management and wealth building after graduating from high school i began college at calstate northridge while working part time in security pacific’s’ consumer credit department   i left security pacific in  to take a consumer credit manager position with may company now macy’s department store the experience in consumer credit proved to be invaluable at may i learned much about consumer credit how to underwrite and process revolving credit how to make credit decisions and help clients succeed skills that i rely on today leading dnb first’s consumer credit group vl how long did you stay at may company vince  jackie liuzzi vl about five years i took a break from school got married had kids and progressed further into financial services i worked as a securities broker for a couple of years then took a job as a branch manager for wells fargo bank during a period of rapid growth and expansion in  i quickly advanced and was promoted to district manager community bank president and then to regional president for wells fargo while i was working my way up wells fargo’s ladder i resumed my education earning my graduate certificate in banking from pacific coast banking school at the university of washington my position at wells fargo gave me the opportunity to gain experience in a community bank region managing a geography of traditional and instore branches throughout new mexico my geography covered half the state and gave me a chance to learn a lot about community banking in my role i dealt with a lot of ranchers agricultural lending clients and small businesses i was responsible for some very small communities that had just  people as well as large metropolitan and suburban areas with tens of thousands of people i saw and experienced it all vt did someone see something in you during this time that helped advance your career vl yes i’ll never forget becky jackson my very first district manager at wells fargo bank she hired me as a forward hire branch manager responsible to manage a group of supermarket branches that were in a period of rapid growth my role was to open a branch hire and train the staff do the grand opening and then move on to the next branch becky saw my ability to coach motivate develop and inspire people customers and communities she also promoted me to the leadership role in new mexico where i learned so much about community banking i didn’t realize how flattering her praise was at the time but it’s an ability i’ve leveraged many times over my career vt close the loop vince what brought you to dnb vl i was working as wells fargo’s greater philadelphia regional president when i first came to philadelphia in  i met bill latoff dnb’s chairman and ceo we became friendly saw each other at community events and served on a number of committees together this was during a time when wells fargo and wachovia were going through a significant merger wells fargo’s management was concerned about the philadelphia market’s reaction to the merger as a result i spent a lot of time building key relationships in philadelphia the suburbs and the state of delaware dnb first branch in east goshen during this period bill and i started talking about what he was doing at dnb first and what i wanted to do in my career bill was looking for an executive with proven banking leadership experience who knew how to work at a community level bill and i stayed in touch over a couple of years and in the third quarter of  i made the decision to join dnb vt looking into the rest of  what challenges do you see for you and dnb vl i see a lot of opportunities we had great growth in  on the consumer side of our business going forward i see an opportunity to grow our small business segment and further develop our commercial banking relationships our culture is very entrepreneurial and built to react quickly to the needs of the community we rolled out a number of new products and services in the last  months and have a lot of upside vt you’re on the record as wanting to grow the business and commercial side of the business what are your plans vl just this
