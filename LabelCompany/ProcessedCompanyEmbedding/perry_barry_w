engelhard corps chairman and ceo is assembling four operating units into a seamless yet diversified organization dec   george taninecz email tweet comments  advertisement engelhard corps innovations are frequently visible but seldom noticed the same cannot be said of its chairman and ceo barry w perry and the relentless manner in which he is pursuing the integration of four operating units of the  billion firm into what he describes as a surface and materials science company it is a transformation nearly a decade in preparation starting in  when he joined engelhard perry began quietly working the issue of leveraging technologies across the company first as a group vice president and later as engelhards president a result was that when perry became chairman and ceo in january  succeeding the retiring orin smith i had already started to lay the groundwork for leading the company differently he says iselin njbased engelhard which today operates in  countries and employs  people creates such technologies as catalysts that clean automotive exhaust pigments that give cosmetics their sheen and agricultural coatings that reduce insect damage historically however innovations had flowed separately from its business units  environmental technologies process technologies appearance and performance technologies and materials services perry regarded these structural silos and their ingrained individualism as an impediment to growth it was time for us to be able to articulate a strategy and direction that employees could embrace and rally around  and that the external markets could also get excited about he stresses as he set about pulling down the silos perry was forceful and consistent in articulating his concept of a single company with core competencies in surface and materials science technologybased and marketdriven businesses a passion for productivity and a management mindset to leverage what perry calls commonalities by sharing assets knowledge and human resources there were people who would have criticized the company before because when management spoke to wall street there was one message a slightly different message in the media and a third internally perry acknowledges consistency is part of rebuilding credibility and i was taking every opportunity  a group at a plant site sitting around a lunch table the elevator ride  to reinforce the message and provide the opportunity for people to debate where we were taking it all indications are that perrys message resonated both inside and outside the company and hes been praised for his candor and credibility hes helping the organization see itself differently says mark dresner engelhards vice president for corporate communications instead of seeing engelhard as separate businesses were seeing that there is real commonality perry has done a very good job at setting realistic expectations in terms of financial performance going forward says michael sison first vice president with mcdonald investments inc cleveland hes done a very good job of explaining and helping investors understand the valueproposition that engelhard in total has indeed financial markets no longer see engelhard as a catalyst business or a pigments business but as a single enterprise that can leverage technology into a broadening array of markets perry says the fact that the company has technologies that are interchangeable has allowed them to develop new products in different areas using manufacturing or technological expertise notes sison i think it hits well with the street its a message thats realistic and more importantly we are seeing the results in their financial performance for fiscal year  engelhard reported total return to shareholders of  compared with a negative  for the sp  making one of four in  as president and coo perry began to unite engelhard he started piecing together the companys disparate informationtechnology infrastructure under which each business unit had developed its own platforms we laid out a fiveyear plan and started taking it one bite at a time and learning from each other perry says he also began pulling together the companys people systems perry instituted what he calls the draft filling the best positions in the company with the best people available throughout engelhard regardless of their businessunit backgrounds that had never been done perry notes if you were an automotivecatalyst guy thats what you stayed as forever which meant that when top jobs opened you went outside in contrast perry began filling a talent pool of operating people who knew of and understood other businesses in the company as president perry had headed a group of operating executives and was a member of the management committee which reported to the ceo and included executive staff when he became ceo perry disbanded the committees in their place he created a single strategic leadership team so all managers could participate in decisions now i had a core of operating people who already knew what i meant when i said seamlessly integrated intermingled with the corporate group that had no clue he quips the clueless quickly got cluedin as perry put in place a simpler flatter management structure and did away with excess gatekeepers perry who in  made  million in salary and bonus and about  million in stock awards also shifted the executive compensation system from a businessunit focus toward corporate targets and he changed the bonus metrics to emphasize longterm value over shortterm goals thats why things like return on working capital have improved significantly which really adds to our total value to shareholders and to which the investment community has reacted positively states perry engelhards return on invested capital roic was just  in  in  roic was  sticking to competencies by recognizing that its core competency is in surface and materials science engelhard also has determined what it is not and that has helped the company avoid costly capital forays into the unrewarding indicates perry if our competency is around surface and materials science then theyre not around metal bending he emphasizes unlike the old engelhard which was driven by products and customers and seemingly incapable of exploring and exploiting opportunities outside businessunit boundaries the new engelhard takes its storehouse of technologies and applies them to markets perry stresses the buggywhip manufacturers were very customerbased and productdriven they never saw the market change  and thats the difference in being technologybased and marketdriven a marketdriven focus also prioritizes rd spending engelhards rd outlays were  million in  we have not had a case where we introduce new technology that has no market perry asserts in the past we may have been faulted for having great technological developments that were commercially insignificant  and not recognizing that he admits when you dont recognize that and tend to communicate a development as being significant  and it isnt  then you have a credibility problem with the marketplace both your customers and wall street perry also stresses the diversification of engelhards market mix a move that tends to lessen the impact of a downturn in a single industry on corporate performance and increases the chances of engelhard being able to generate growth and earnings regardless of market cycles for example engelhards environmental group previously generated more than  of earnings from the auto industry these days about  of its earnings are autoindustrybased as catalysts to help control emissions are finding their way into lawnandgarden utility and restaurant equipment now when we go through a downturn like we did in  we have a little more resiliency says perry engelhards ceo spent  years with general electric co but perry hasnt tried to transplant ge practices rather what you transplant are the concepts you have learned the things about productivity empowering workforces and management teams and giving them the freedom to act and the accountability to act he insists its paid off for engelhard for example last year a crosssection of engelhard businessunit managers redeployed assets at a paperpigments plant to create additional production capacity to meet rising demand for a petroleumrefining product that improves gasoline yields in the process the managers found opportunities to redeploy assets for engelhards materialsservices unit and they also streamlined the plants existing technologies roster targeting growth aspects of a maturing market we were able to meet two growth objectives  one in the refining area and one in specialty materials area  with no capital and in the end we were able to produce the same tons of product with a better growth profile and a higher margin mix perry says that was done by bringing three businesses together and focusing on how to be more productive as an enterprise as opposed to how do i make my little sandbox better than your sandbox  print reprints favorite email tweet please log in or register to post comments advertisement related articleshow to fit all your
