longshort equity special situationssummaryi have sold my remaining shares in hercules capitali discuss whyan investment in htgc yields  percentbusiness development company hercules capital inc nasdaqhtgc said last week that it plans to transition to an external management structure which triggered a significant drop in the companys share price i have sold  percent of hercules capital before the selloff and have now liquidated my position entirely external management structure will likely cost shareholders more money impacting shareholder returns i bought hercules capital at the end of  for my highyield income portfolio my weighted average purchase price was  for the  shares i bought in total i paid  for my long position in hercules capital i locked in a dividend yield of  percent at the time i had good reasons to purchase hercules capital then still known as hercules technology growth capital hercules capital had grown portfolio assets considerably and the business development company had no problems covering its stable dividend payout further positive asset sensitivity tilted the odds in favor of making an investment higher short term interest rates translate into higher earnings from a floatingrate investment portfolio simply put the higher interest rates climb the more money companies like hercules capital make from their variablerate debt investments potentially allowing the company to pay a higher regular cash dividend or even a special dividend why i am out now hercules capital has produced good returns for shareholders including me partly because of hercules capitals internal management structure and high internal rates of return in my last piece i penned on hercules capital i discussed the disadvantages that come with external management structures those disadvantages relate to two potential problems  external management structures tend to come with higher management costs higher management costs translate into lower shareholder returns this is intuitive because higher costs reduce profits available for distribution  external management structures create an incentive for the external manager to prioritize growth in assets under management instead of prioritizing increasing shareholder returns companies that have external managers are less regarded in the market and investors often apply a discount to their valuations reflecting those disadvantages i dont like external management structures all that much for the two reasons discussed here hercules capitals shares slumped after management said that it will ask shareholders to approve the new management structure and it will be much harder for the business development company to explain why shares should sell for a higher premium to net asset value i think the transition to an external management structure is not in the interest of shareholders and for that reason i am out your takeaway the market reaction after hercules capitals announcement to transition to a new management structure speaks volumes investors dont like it and neither do i higher management costs and an incentive to grow assets are good enough reasons to reevaluate hercules capital whether shareholder returns will indeed decrease or not remains to be seen but the market clearly doesnt like managements actions i am out if you like to read more of my articles and like to
