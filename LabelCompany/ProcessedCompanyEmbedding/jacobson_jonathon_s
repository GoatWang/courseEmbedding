at harvard management co which provided  million of the  billion highfields raised in  highfields capital returned around  between  and  vs  return for the sp  index during the same time periodjonathon jacobson has admitted that the holy grail of value investing a good company trading at a cheap price is very elusive in the modern financial markets even with the resources of a hedge fund research team as a result he claims that highfields end up looking at unattractive businesses which carry low valuations because the market expects that poor performance to continue if the price is low enough or if the company’s struggles have been due to problems which are getting weaker then it might be a buyconsidering that the hedge fund tends to manage a moderately concentrated portfolio in its most recent f filing the six largest positions were responsible for about  of the reported investments it seems to us that the fund doesn’t need to find too many “close enough” picks to match its large size as long as it can invest high amounts of capital the smallest of these six largest positions was over  million in turn the large size of the positions and the concentration of the portfolio generally results in fairly long holding periods for highfields jonathon jacobson has claimed that a holding period can be two to three years between september  and september  the same three stocks have held the top three slots in the fund’s f portfolio according to our database of filings and two more of the most recent top six had highfields report a position of at least  million a year
