philosophy meet the team marketing  legal fund structure letters  articles investment philosophy  overview  sandler cres i lp the fund will invest in publicly traded real estate securities  the fund will invest primarily in small to midcap real estate investment trusts reits with limited analyst coverage that are trading at a discount or premium to net asset value nav  we will take a long position in companies trading at a discount and short those selling at a premium to capitalize on the disparity between the security’s market value and the net asset value of the company’s properties  the goal of the fund is to outperform reit equity indices such as ftse nareit us real estate index fnar and the morgan stanley us reit index mscirms by    unique niche  the fund is a very focused investment vehicle seeking to achieve the benefits of investing in real estate such as cash flow portfolio diversification and asset appreciation without some of the negatives of direct investing such as lack of transparency and liquidity along with an inability to have property sector and geographic diversification  it seeks decreased volatility through portfolio diversity the use of index and stock shorts along with investing in noncorrelated real estate yield securities such as reit preferred stocks and mortgage reits management strength  neal cukerbaum is the managing member and founder of ssw capital llc the manager and the general partner and manager of sandler cres i lp  he has more than  years experience in all aspects of commercial real estate development acquisition leasing and management of more than  commercial projects  neal has been an active investor in publicly traded real estate companies for more than  years     the case for reits reits have provided a significant investment return premium compared with private equity real estate funds  publicly traded equity reits have outperformed core valueadded and opportunistic funds consistently over the long term experienced stronger bull markets recovered faster from downturns and have lower fees and expenses compared with private equity real estate funds  the reit business model is a long term vehicle that encourages strategic decision making and alignment of management with the shareholders compared to limited life private equity real estate that has predetermined investment and liquidation time periods with management that is invested across many funds” morningstar report  nav analysis “the case for nav analysis of reits is that real estate company values are largely dependent on the values of the properties they own and these values can be reasonably estimated whereas the intrinsic asset values of companies that make things or provide services are extremely difficult to determine…to paraphrase winston churchill nav analysis is the worst form of reit valuation except for all the others that have been tried”  ralph block  reit investor since  and portfolio manager from  until his

have real estate professionals evaluating real estate companies not financial analysts examining securities  our staff consultants and industry resources have built leased managed bought and sold all types of commercial real estate in virtually all geographic areas through many real estate cycles capital investment requirements when comparing real estate asset trades everyone talks about the magical “cap rate” or the initial net operating income as a percentage of the purchase price  what goes unsaid is the amount of capital that will be required to maintain the initial yield over a period of time  office space typically requires a much higher capital investment through tenant finish allowances and lease commissions than retail space where the tenant builds the success of the enterprise at the particular location or industrial space which is typically very generic copyright  7  ssw capital  all rights reserved privacy policy disclaimer powered by hedgeco websites microsoft
