allocations among a broad range of underlying t rowe price stock and bond funds will change over time the retirement funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of

the target funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon the target date funds are not designed for a lumpsum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income the key difference between the retirement funds and the target funds is the overall allocation to equity although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date the retirement funds

approach the strategy seeks to improve the longterm riskreturn profile of a diversified equity portfolio by dampening the sensitivity to material changes in the prevailing inflation regimethe fund is designed as an asset allocation product that invests in the securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to real assets“real assets” are assets that have physical properties such as energy and natural resources real estate basic materials equipment utilities and infrastructure and commodities such assets may produce cash flows and subsequent valuations that increase when the overall price level in the economy is risingthe fund is expected to respond more favorably to periods of high or rising inflation than the broad equity market does where broad equity returns are relatively weak at the cost of less favorable returns during periods of low or falling inflation where broad equity returns are relatively strong thus as a strategic component of a diversified portfolio it seeks to dampen the long term volatility of the real inflationadjusted returns of such a portfolio which is expected to result in a relatively more consistent growth of capital for a longterm investorbecause the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries since there is no limit on the funds investments in foreign securities or emerging markets it will be
