segments had the largest improvement over last year diluted earnings per share increased  to  reaffirming annual guidance for earnings to be slightly above  per diluted share substantial increases in utility support structures and irrigation segment sales drove second quarter performance said mogens c bay valmonts chairman and chief executive officer engineered support structures and coatings segment sales also improved while energy and mining sales declined due to weaker end market demand overall a less favorable sales mix and some lagging recoveries of increased raw material costs resulted in slightly lower operating income as a percent of sales second quarter segment review infrastructurerelated engineered support structures  of sales poles towers and components for the global lighting traffic and wireless communication markets and highway safety products sales of  million were  higher than last year mainly due to increased intersegment sales to the utility support structures segment and improved wireless communication product sales in north america lighting sales decreased slightly in north america and europe partly offset by higher sales in the asiapacific region operating income was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in  the effect of higher steel costs and higher intersegment sales resulted in margin compression utility support structures  of salessteel and concrete structures for the global electric utility industry sales of  million increased  over last year driven by a combination of volume increases and some pricing tied to higher steel costs sales growth remains supported by the ongoing expansion of the north american grid to improve its reliability and capacity new investments in renewable energy generation also contribute to the need for transmission structures operating income increased to  million or  of sales compared to  million or  in  the increase in operating income was due to higher sales operating income as a percent of sales declined due to a less favorable product line mix coatings segment  of salesglobal galvanizing painting and anodizing services sales of  million were  higher than last year mostly due to increased activity in the asiapacific region north american sales improved benefitting from the new facility in texas and increased internal volumes to other segments which partially offset lower external demand operating income was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in  the decrease in operating income resulted from the effect of lower external volumes and zinc cost increases not fully recovered in sales by pricing this was partly offset by improved profitability in the asiapacific region energy and mining segment  of sales offshore structures engineered access systems and grinding media sales of  million were  lower than last year mostly due to lower sales of access systems expansion into markets outside of mining and energy helped mitigate the impact of reduced demand from markets exposed to oil and gas which weakened during the quarter operating income at  million was  higher at  of sales compared to  million or  of sales last year agriculturerelated irrigation segment  of salesagricultural irrigation equipment parts services and tubular products sales of  million rose  above last year with significant increases in both north america and international regions north american sales increased due to improved demand from markets outside the traditional cornbelt additionally higher equipment operating times drove increased service parts sales the broad increase in international sales was led by project demand and continued favorable market conditions in brazil operating income was higher at  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in  the decline in operating income as a percent of sales was due to higher raw material costs only partly offset by leverage of volume and selling general and administrative expenses outlook we are reaffirming our annual guidance for earnings to be slightly above  per diluted share said mr bay the utility market has developed stronger than our earlier expectations and we anticipate good demand for the rest of the year in engineered support structures we believe moderating steel costs along with price recovery reinforces expectations for second half improvement in coatings we expect stable demand supported by internal and industrial demand our energy and mining segment is challenged by difficult endmarket demand and we expect lower second half

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
