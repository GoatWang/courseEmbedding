ubiquiti networks robust product pipeline suggests future growth  ubiquiti networks inc nasdaqubnt  seeking alphasign in  join nowgoÂ»ubiquiti networks robust product pipeline suggests future growthmay  about ubiquiti networks ubnt grant beaty tech longshort equitysummarywith a pe of  ubiquiti networks is priced lower than many nogrowth companies such as cisco it also has a substantial short interest  of the floatyet the company has a long history of growth operates in growing markets has guided higher for   billion in revenue and has a robust product pipelinein this article i explore new hardware software and firmware which may drive future growth the product lines covered include airmax unifi elite ufiber airfiber ltu amplifi and othersshorts should ask themselves why most or all of these initiatives will fail otherwise additional growth is likelydespite a slim rd budget of  of revenues ubiquiti networks nasdaqubnt develops and releases a large number of varied products some new product lines dont do so well unifi voip mfi and until recently unifi video but their low cost means the company can afford to try many different initiatives without much fear of failure the result is a long history of organic growth and a growing product pipeline ive noticed both professional analysts and retail investors seem largely ignorant of ubiquitis pipeline this article is an attempt to remedy this ignorance it is not intended for investors new to ubnt for that i recommend the companys recent investor presentation or many of the other articles here on seeking alpha the following is a list of products and other developments that i believe have good chances of driving future growth more information is available via the forums and even more is available to beta testers unfortunately ubnts terms of service prevent me from disclosing any beta information here so i am leaving a good bit out of my analysis airmax ac airmax used to be ubiquitis bread and butter longdistance fixed outdoor wireless based on  chipsets is what launched the company airmax ac is airmax using ac chipsets the fastest wifi standard in wide use today it was released in july of  though it didnt become widely available until later in the year notice the dive in service provider revenues after the release of ac given the growth of the industry and success of airfiber since the airmax ac release its likely ubnt has given up quite a bit of market share since then airmax ac had numerous issues which hurt its adoption its larger problems were dfs certification from with fcc is required for wifi devices to operate in the  mhz unii band it took ubnt over a year to get most ac devices certified as this ridiculous thread shows it was a frustrating wait for many wisps airmax ac was not backwardscompatible with airmax m n gear until early  this meant that it was impossible to upgrade customers incrementally requiring the replacement of dozens of cpes along with a tower ap this meant airmax ac was largely limited to greenfield deployments gps synchronization was and is still not available gps sync allows all radios on a tower to all broadcast and receive at the same times eliminating the possibility of one of them interfering with another by broadcasting while the other is receiving this allows wisps to make better use of their most precious commodity wireless spectrum general stability issues with various firmware versions lack of  ghz and  mhz radios management software aircontrol  faced some horrendous delays it is not hard to find disgruntled exubnt wisps who have switched to cambiums epmp platform though its based on the older n technology epmp has had working gps sync dfs certification and generally better stability fortunately for ubnt airmax acs problems are soon to be in the rearview mirror dfs certification was received years ago backwards compatibility mode was released in december gps sync is now in beta and stability is much improved aircontrol  is back under active development theres also a new version of airlink a software tool used to plan outdoor wireless deployments for pointtomultipoint links in addition the company is rolling out a refresh of airmax ac called simply ac it uses the same chipset and firmware as ac but boasts improved antennas different antenna designs horns and better receiver hardware all this translates into better performance than ac in many environments ac also has a  ghz radio the new horn antennas are really neat horn antennas themselves are nothing new  theyve been around for about a century theyve not been popular with wisps due to their lower gain than traditional antennas however they do have one significant advantage horns have focused and symmetrical beam patterns meaning they only emit and receive microwaves from one direction this in turn reduces emitted and received interference they can be very useful in areas of high interference though are often inferior to traditional antennas due to their lower gain highgain horns are very large as far as i can tell ubnts asymmetric horns the two at the top of the first picture are unique or at least unique in the wisp industry theyre also much cheaper than the competition the horn antenna option should increase airmax acs addressable market into highernoise environments which are becoming increasingly common look for ac to start making a difference in revenues a bit this quarter and more thereafter ucrm  complete wisp management platform as part of the companys effort to decommoditize its products ubiquiti is creating software to help isps manage billing and customer relations because it can handle billing theres potential for ucrm to provide some recurring revenues author update  solarbeam solarbeam is a plugandplay networkmanageable solar panel and battery kit for supplying  volts to offgrid devices its primarily aimed at wisps who need to power small towers called micropops with no access to grid power previously wisps would piece together their own kits im told solarbeam is both easier and less expensive than the alternatives solar beam could be a small growth driver because it increases the attractiveness of the entire service provider ecosystem its also possible solarbeam could be repurposed for other markets airfiber ltu  was designed for indoor use while it can be successfully applied to the outdoors with some modification it is far from an ideal candidate for outdoor fixed wireless nonetheless it is almost exclusively used by wisps due to the low cost of  chipsets there is a huge economy of scale in chip manufacturing airfiber was ubnts first attempt to scrap  for pointtopoint links it has been very successful delivering more spectral efficiency than its  competition today there are six airfiber radios available covering the    and  ghz bands ltu is a  year ubnt project which was first unveiled at wispapalooza last october its designed to be an improvement on airfiber improving its pointtopoint performance and enabling pointtomultipoint the downside is that ltu will be its own proprietary standard and wont be compatible with existing wireless networks it will also be more expensive than airmax gear though i presume still cheaper than the based gear from some other manufacturers such as mimosa or cambium the last earnings released mentioned nonrecurring engineering milestone payments as a reason for higher rd expenses in q its my guess this is tooling costs for ltu asic development asics have very high fixed costs if airmaxs competitors cambium mikrotik mimosa are also developing something similar to ltu theyve not announced it cambium has yet to even release an ac product and mimosa appears to be struggling with its own ac line the real competition to ltu may come from lte manufacturers like baicells lte is optimized for use by large carriers who own their slice of spectrum and does not perform nearly as well in the largely unlicensed environments wisps use for these reasons ltu may be able to offer both lower cost and higher performance word is that ltu will be available at the end of this year im guessing that means itll be shown at wispapalooza in october and available in the beta store around november or december unifi unifi is ubiquitis brand of enterprise wireless access points switches and other devices which can all be centrally managed through the unifi controller i put enterprise in quotes because theres little evidence unifi has actually penetrated many enterprises the ecosystem has instead started from meager beginnings as n gear suitable for lowdensity deployments and slowly worked its way upstream to highdensity ac mumimo wave since the introduction of the secondgeneration access points uapacpro lite and lr at the end of  enterprise revenues have exploded and show no signs of stopping as its clearly not done growing unifi is a growth driver in and of itself however there are additional products and features being added to unifi which should speed adoption when reviewing these products and services keep in mind that unifi is not just a family of waps but an ecosystem with switches software and more any product which allows unifi to be used in new circumstances will increase the demand for the entire product line uapachd this is ubiquitis first mumimo ac wave access point it is designed for high user densities such as airports hospitals conferences and the like the hd is a growth driver because it was only announced in february and has not yet begun shipping in large quantities shopbltcom has recently ordered about  units and they appear to be selling well on amazon it will also increase demand for the entire unifi ecosystem in deployments which require highdensity aps look for the hd to start making a difference in this quarter uapacshd this asyetunannounced product will likely be a uapachd with a builtin security radio this allows the shd to scan for security problems like rogue access points as well as monitor the spectrum for noise and optimal channel selection for a more detailed explanation of why security radios are desirable see this meraki blog post in the q earnings call ceo robert pera said i believe probably over this next year uapachd should be the highest revenue product not only in unifi but in the whole company this statement may seem a bit strange given the hd is in something of a niche compared to the uapacpro the current best seller its possible he was referring to both the hd and the shd here as they are likely largely the same product and the shd hadnt yet been mentioned with their much higher asps and potential for enterprise adoption its possible they could live up to their promise even if robert is being optimistic it indicates theres a lot of potential in the shd waps the shd will be a growth driver for the entire unifi ecosystem because it has the security features enterprises want i expect it to be available on the beta store in the next few months uapxg this one is a mystery to me it lacks ac in its part number so it is probably not based on an ac chipset some people are theorizing it is based on qualcomms nasdaqqcom ipq ax chipset it could be the  wap robert mentioned in the february earnings call so that will start a trend and youll see us were going to have  this year well have aps that cost by the end of the year  and i think youll see people also buy those and have interest in them without knowing more about it its hard to say whether the xg will enable unifi to expand into more markets it will if its an ultrahigh density ap for use in stadiums and the like hosted unifi controllers i believe unifi elite is ubiquitis first foray into recurring revenue it is a paid service offering controller hosting live support faster rma and extended warranties for unifi devices in addition to providing some revenue of its own it should drive growth of the unifi ecosystem for customers who require premium support it is currently only available in north america however as ubiquiti is opening distribution centers in europe i assume unifi elite will be expanding theres also a new year highavailability hosted option for the unifi controller unifi switches there are a good number of higherperformance unifi switches coming out with sfp ports unfortunately i dont know enough about highend networking switches to comment much on them i do know theyre part of ubiquitis plan to move up the market into enterprise ufiber ufiber is ubiquitis foray into gpon networking like ubnts other product lines expect ufiber to be a family of products with software management and valueadding network effects manufacturers adherence to gpon standards are notoriously inconsistent keeping gpon products from being commodities like unmanaged switches or the like ufiber products are currently on the beta store international growth eyeballing the revenue figures and looking at amazon bestseller lists gives one the sense most of unifis growth has occurred in the us page  of the february  investor presentation which unfortunately has been replaced by the may presentation so i cannot provide a link confirms this showing  of the growth from september  to september  to be from the united states in addition to opening up new distribution centers in europe as mentioned in the q earnings call ubiquiti is also making efforts to translate much of its software into more languages there could be significant international growth ahead especially for unifi amplifi amplifi is ubnts first serious consumer product while it has received good reviews i havent yet seen evidence that it is selling well its usually  on amazons bestselling routers like most ubnt products and unlike other mesh systems such as the orbi amplifi has not seen a costly marketing campaign in the last earnings call robert indicated he was expecting a slow ramp upward like he sees with his other product lines there will soon be a line of home security cameras to go with the router and mesh points the goal here seems to be to create an ecosystem of home networking devices similar to unifi because competition in the consumer space is fiercer expect lower margins out of amplifi i am skeptical of amplifis success ubnts business model leverages the high level of interest professional installers have for their gear which is lessened in the consumer space without it consumers may default to purchasing amplifis more hyped and advertised competition many people also dislike the mesh points and i believe a more traditional mesh point design could be well received nonetheless if amplifi is not a success i dont expect it to meaningfully impact the companys bottom line ubnts lowcost approach to everything means it can easily afford to try and fail amplifi protect amplifi protect appears to be a line of nvr and camera products aimed at home use there used to be a play store app for it but it has been taken down you can still see some views of the nvr in this youtube video ethermagic ethermagic appears to be a consumer powerline networking product these devices being practically commodities its not immediately obvious what opportunity ubnt sees in this market the google play store app description gives us a hint an ethermagic network consists of one ethermagic switch and one or more ethermagic endpoints each endpoint must be paired with a switch to create a network to my knowledge no existing powerline product uses switches and endpoints it may be that ubnt has discovered a way to improve powerline networking ethermagic is currently being sold on the beta store conclusion in the last earnings call ceo robert pera stated our rd is  i believe its the most efficient in the world its hard to determine what is the most efficient in the world but it is clear ubiquiti has a very large number of buns in the oven on what appears to be a slim rd budget unifi is well poised to continue its growth and upmarket movement airmax ac is poised to take back some lost market share and ltu may be the next big thing in fixed outdoor wireless while i dont believe there is a valid short thesis at the current pps there is some reason to be a skeptical bull ubiquiti has a history of failing to deliver on software and firmware aircontrol  various airmax ac firmwares it also has a good number of product lines which have flopped or not lived up to their potential mfi voip airmax ac unifi video while ubiquiti has clearly improved its software and firmware development processes skeptics may wish to wait and gauge forum sentiment of these new efforts its worth noting that the airfiber team the same team that made the first wlan products at motorola nysemsi has always delivered solid products with wireless ethernet powerline fiber optics associated management software and a vibrant community with googleable solutions ubiquiti is positioning itself to be an endtoend networking provider if it can offer a consistent user experience and unified software management throughout its product lines it could become an emerging defacto standard in networking the one thing i

extractionedit in  it was discovered that there was a security issue in the version of the uboot boot loader shipped on ubiquitis devices it was possible to extract the plaintext configuration from

this botnet usually airos said bryan campbell lead threat intelligence analyst at fujitsu the consistency in which the botnet is communicating with compromised routers in relation to both distribution and communication leads us to believe known vulnerabilities are being exploited in the firmware which allows this to occur ipoedit on october   ubiquiti networks had its initial public offering ipo at
