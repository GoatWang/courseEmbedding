company and do not consider ourselves to be a blank check company as we  ·have a specific business plan we have provided a detailed plan for the next twelve  months throughout our prospectus·have no intention of entering into a reverse merger with any entity in an unrelated industry in the future since our inception through february   we have not generated any revenues and have incurred a net loss of  we anticipate the commencement of generating revenues in the next twelve months the capital raised in this offering has been budgeted to cover the costs associated with beginning to operate our company marketing expense and acquisition related costs we intend on using the majority of the proceeds from this offering for the acquisition of properties however closing and other acquisition related costs such as title insurance professional fees and taxes will likely require cash we do not have the ability to quantify any of the expenses as they will all depend on size of deal price and place versus procuring new financing due diligence performed such as appraisal environmental property condition reports legal and accounting etc there is no way to predict or otherwise detail expenses we intend on engaging in the following activities    purchase multifamily properties and senior living care facilities that have potential to be or are cash flow positive meaning properties

review the total gross rent income or receipts from the property and subtract any and all expenses including utilities taxes maintenance and other reserve expenses if this number is a positive number the company will deem the property cash flow positive depending on how positive the cash flow is will determine whether the management will purchase the property or not on behalf of the company there

bureau of labor statistics setting the threshold to the nearest  during its most recently completed fiscal year we would lose our emerging growth status if we were to exceed  in gross revenues we are not sure this will ever take place because we are an emerging growth company we have the exemption from section b of sarbanesoxley act of  and section aa and b of the securities exchange act of  under section b we are now exempt from the internal control assessment required by subsection a that requires each independent auditor that prepares or issues the audit report for the issuer shall attest to

following material risks general risks related to our business we are an emerging growth company organized in february  and have recently commenced operations which makes an evaluation of us extremely difficult at this stage of our business operations even with our good faith efforts we may never become profitable or generate any significant amount of revenues thus potential investors have a high probability of losing their investment we were organized in february  and have not yet started operations as a result of our startup operations we have i generated no revenues ii will accumulate deficits due to organizational and startup activities business plan development and professional fees since we organized there is nothing at this time on which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful or that we will ever be able to operate profitably our future operating results will depend on many factors including our ability to raise adequate working capital availability of properties for purchase the level of our competition and our ability to attract and maintain key management and employees we are significantly dependent on joseph d ryan and brandon j herbst the loss or unavailability of his services would have an adverse effect on our business operations and prospects in that we may not be able to obtain new management under the same financial arrangements which could result in a loss of your investment  our business plan is significantly dependent upon the abilities and continued participation of joseph d ryan and brandon j herbst it would be difficult to replace joseph d ryan and brandon j herbst at such an early stage of development of the company the loss by or unavailability of their services would have an adverse effect on our business operations and prospects in that our inability to replace joseph d ryan and brandon j herbst could result in the loss of ones investment there can be no assurance that we would be able to locate or employ personnel to replace mr ryan and mr herbst should their services be discontinued in the event that we are unable to locate or employ personnel to replace mr ryan and mr herbstwe would be required to cease pursuing our business opportunity which could result in a loss of your investment our independent auditors have expressed in their report substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations andor obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due you may not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them which makes your investment more speculative you will be unable to evaluate the economic merit of our note investments before we invest in them and will be entirely relying on the ability of madyson capital management llc our general partner to select our investments furthermore our general partner will have broad discretion in implementing policies regarding tenant or mortgagor creditworthiness and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate potential tenants managers or borrowers these factors increase the risk that your investment may not generate returns comparable to our competitors      our general partner will have complete control over the company and will therefore make all decisions of which limited partners will have no control madyson capital management llc our general partner shall make certain decisions without input by the limited partners such decisions may pertain to employment decisions including our general partners compensation arrangements the appointment of other officers and managers and whether to enter into material transactions with related parties an investment in the interests is highly illiquid you may never be able to sell or otherwise dispose of your interests since there is no public trading market for our interests you may never be able to liquidate your investment or otherwise dispose of your interests the company does currently have a redemption program but there is no guarantee that the company will ever redeem or buy back your interests further no one is allowed to redeem their interests until twelve  months after the interests were purchased the company will only redeem interests up to  of the value of the assets in any giving quarter   risks related to the real estate business in general the profitability of attempted acquisitions is uncertain we intend to acquire properties selectively acquisition of properties entails risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations in undertaking these acquisitions we will incur certain risks including the expenditure of funds on and the devotion of managements time to transactions that may not come to fruition additional risks inherent in acquisitions include risks that the properties will not achieve anticipated occupancy levels and that estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property may prove inaccurate expenses may be greater than anticipated real estate investments are illiquid because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions will be limited the foregoing and any other factor or event that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions our properties will be subject to increases in tax rates utility costs operating expenses insurance costs repairs and maintenance administrative and other expenses if we are unable to lease properties on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of the expenses we would be required to pay those costs which could adversely affect funds available for future acquisitions or cash available for distributions if we purchase assets at a time when the multifamily real estate market is experiencing substantial influxes of capital investment and competition for properties the real estate we purchase may not appreciate or may decrease in value the multifamily real estate markets are currently experiencing a substantial influx of capital from investors worldwide this substantial flow of capital combined with significant competition for real estate may result in inflated purchase prices for such assets to the extent we purchase real estate in such an environment we are subject to the risk that if the real estate market ceases to attract the same level of capital investment in the future as it is currently attracting or if the number of companies seeking to acquire such assets decreases our returns will be lower and the value of our assets may not appreciate or may decrease significantly below the amount we paid for such assets      a multifamily propertys income and value may be adversely affected by national and regional economic conditions local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of properties or a reduction in demand for properties availability of for sale properties competition from other similar properties our ability to provide adequate maintenance insurance and management services increased operating costs including real estate taxes the attractiveness and location of the property and changes in market rental rates our income will be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if our properties cannot be rented on favorable terms our performance is linked to economic conditions in the regions where our properties will be located and in the market for multifamily space generally therefore to the extent that there are adverse economic conditions in those regions and in these markets generally that impact the applicable market rents such conditions could result in a reduction of our income and cash available for distributions and thus affect the amount of distributions we can make to you we may depend on multifamily tenants or senior living facility residents or both for some of our revenue and therefore our revenue may depend on the success and economic viability of our multifamily tenants we will be highly dependent on income from either tenants of a multifamily building residents at a senior living care facility or both our financial results will depend in part on leasing space in the properties we acquire to tenants on economically favorable terms in the event of a tenant default prior to stabilization we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and reletting our property a default of a substantial tenant or number of tenants at any one time on lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue associated with such leases and cause us to have to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments and prevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage therefore lease payment defaults by tenants could cause us to lose our investment or reduce the amount of distributions to limited partners a lessee or operator of our senior living care facilities may not obtain or maintain the applicable licenses and permits and otherwise may fail to comply with applicable law and in such case the lessee or operator may be subject to fines or be unable to operate which might result in the lessee or operator failing to pay rent the lessee or operators failure to pay rent would materially and adversely affect us and your investment  we may elect to operate a senior care living facility ourselves or rent the facility to an experienced operator as a provider of residential care services licensed by the department of social services the lessee or operator will be required to comply with the federal and state laws and regulations governing health care providers as a residential care facility for the elderly if the lessee or operator fails to obtain or maintain the appropriate licenses and permits it will be unable to operate which would materially and adversely affect its ability to pay rent and therefore materially and adversely affect us further if lessee or operator fails to otherwise comply with applicable law it may be subject to fines and other punishment which would also materially and adversely affect us  the current laws concerning health care may increase our costs of compliance or affect our ability to charge our intended rates changes in regulation of healthcare and in particular regulation of health insurance providers or a transition to a government insured health system could adversely impact the ability of healthcare institutions and professionals to continue to realize current revenue levels as a result of among other causes government restrictions on amounts charged increased operating costs as a result of compliance or delays in reimbursement to our residents while operation of these types of properties does not rely directly on government programs for income any changes in government health care programs may affect the ability of these properties to charge the fees contemplated or to collect fees from residents of the properties were such circumstances to become a reality operations of the lessee or operator could be affected adversely both administratively and financially in such an event the ability to recognize appreciation on any acquired properties which we may acquire may be adversely affected or a diminution of value could occur as a result of rental market rates for senior living care facilities decline on a broader scale      healthcare operations are subject to litigation risks and increasing insurance costs and if such anticipated costs arise our ability to pay distributions to limited partners will be adversely affected  in several well publicized instances private litigation by residents of senior living communities for negligence or alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against some operating companies in the senior living industry the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to dramatically increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by companies operating senior living care facilities workers compensation and employee health insurance costs have also increased in recent years medical liability insurance reform has become a topic of political debate and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards however if such reforms are not generally adopted insurance costs may continue to increase if insurance costs increase faster than projected it will likely adversely affect the operating cash flow of the lessee or operator and its ability to pay rent to us and therefore adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to limited partners we may not make a profit if we sell a property the prices that we can obtain when we determine to sell a property will depend on many factors that are presently unknown including the operating history tax treatment of real estate investments demographic trends in the area and available financing there is a risk that we will not realize any significant appreciation on our investment in a property accordingly your ability to recover all or any portion of your investment under such circumstances will depend on the amount of funds so realized and claims to be satisfied therefrom this offering is a blind pool offering and therefore limited partners will not have the opportunity to evaluate some of our investments before we make them which makes investments more speculative  we will seek to invest substantially all of the net offering proceeds from this offering after the payment of fees and expenses in the acquisition of or investment in interests in assets however because as of the date of this prospectus we have not identified the assets we expect to acquire and because our limited partners will be unable to evaluate the economic merit of assets before we invest in them they will have to rely on the ability of our manager to select suitable and successful investment opportunities these factors increase the risk that our limited partners investment may not generate returns comparable to our competitors our properties may not be diversified our potential profitability and our ability to diversify our investments may be limited both geographically and by type of properties purchased we will be able to purchase additional properties only as additional funds are raised and only if owners of real estate accept our preferred interests in exchange for an interest in the target property or title to the property our properties may not be well diversified and their economic performance could be affected by changes in local economic conditions our performance is therefore linked to economic conditions in the regions in which we will acquire properties and in the market for real estate properties generally therefore to the extent that there are adverse economic conditions in the regions in which our properties are located and in the market for real estate properties such conditions could result in a reduction of our income and cash to return capital and thus affect the amount of distributions we can make to you competition with third parties in acquiring and operating properties may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities many of which have greater resources than we do specifically there are numerous commercial developers real estate companies and foreign investors that operate in the markets in which we may operate that will compete with us in acquiring residential commercial and other properties that will be seeking investments and tenants for these properties      many of these entities have significant financial and other resources including operating experience allowing them to compete effectively with us competitors with substantially greater financial resources than us may generally be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of entities in which investments may be made or risks attendant to a geographic concentration of investments demand from third parties for properties that meet our investment objectives could result in an increase of the price of such properties if we pay higher prices for properties our profitability may be reduced and you may experience a lower return on your investment in addition our properties may be located in close proximity to other properties that will compete against our properties for tenants many of these competing properties may be better located andor appointed than the properties that we will acquire giving these properties a competitive advantage over our properties and we may in the future face additional competition from properties not yet constructed or even planned this competition could adversely affect our business the number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount of rents charged we could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties causing increased competition for residential renters in addition our ability to charge premium rental rates to tenants may be negatively impacted this increased competition may increase our costs of acquisitions or lower the occupancies and the rent we may charge tenants this could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties which we would not have otherwise made thus affecting cash available for distributions to you we may not have control over costs arising from rehabilitation or ground up construction of properties we may elect to acquire properties which may require rehabilitation or even be from the ground up meaning that we purchase the land and implement a plan to construct a multifamily building on the land in particular we may acquire affordable properties that we will rehabilitate and convert to market rate properties we may also purchase land entitle the land for a multifamily building or senior living facility if that is not already provided architect a multifamily building or senior living facility and build a brand new multifamily building or senior care facility consequently we intend to retain independent general contractors to perform the actual physical rehabilitation andor construction work and will be subject to risks in connection with a contractors ability to control rehabilitation andor construction costs the timing of completion of rehabilitation andor construction and a contractors ability to build in conformity with plans and specification inventory or available properties might not be sufficient to real our investment goals  we may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms failures in identifying or consummating acquisitions would impair the pursuit of our business plan limited partners ultimately may not like the location lease terms or other relevant economic and financial data of any real properties other assets or other companies that we may acquire in the future moreover our acquisition strategy could involve significant risks that could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results including the following increases in asking prices by acquisition candidates to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria diversion of managements attention to expansion efforts unanticipated costs and contingent or undisclosed liabilities associated with acquisitions failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results and difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience the consideration paid for our target acquisition may exceed fair market value which may harm our financial condition and operating results the consideration that we pay will be based upon numerous factors and the target acquisition may be purchased in a negotiated transaction rather than through a competitive bidding process we cannot assure anyone that the purchase price that we pay for a target acquisition or its appraised value will be a fair price that we will be able to generate an acceptable return on such target acquisition or that the location lease terms or other relevant economic and financial data of any properties that we acquire will meet acceptable risk profiles we may also be unable to lease vacant space or renegotiate existing leases at market rates which would adversely affect our returns on a target acquisition as a result our investments in our target acquisition may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations which may substantially harm our operating results and financial condition      the failure of our properties to generate positive cash flow or to appreciate in value would most likely preclude our limited partners from realizing a return on their interest ownership there is no assurance that our real estate investments will appreciate in value or will ever be sold at a profit the marketability and value of the properties will depend upon many factors beyond the control of our management there is no assurance that there will be a ready market for the properties since investments in real property are generally nonliquid the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by it or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property moreover we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure any person that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to lockout provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these lockout provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could significantly harm our financial condition and operating results illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties or investments in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions may be limited in particular these risks could arise from weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers changes in national or international economic conditions and changes in laws regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale other disposition or refinance at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy an exit event is not guaranteed and is subject to the managers discretion risks related to financing we might obtain lines of credit and other borrowings which increases our risk of loss due to potential foreclosure we may obtain lines of credit and longterm financing that may be secured by our assets as with any liability there is a risk that we may be unable to repay our obligations from the cash flow of our assets therefore when borrowing and securing such borrowing with our assets we risk losing such assets in the event we are unable to repay such obligations or meet such demands  we have broad authority to incur debt and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and decrease the value of our investors investments our policies do not limit us from incurring debt until our total liabilities would be at  of the total equity capitalization of the company we intend to borrow as much as  of the value of our properties we do not currently own any properties high debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments and may also be accompanied by restrictive covenants these factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of our investors investments     risks related to our corporate structure we do not set aside funds in a sinking fund to pay distributions or redeem the interests so you must rely on our revenues from operations and other sources of funding for distributions and withdrawal requests these sources may not be sufficient to meet these obligations we do not contribute funds on a regular basis to a separate account commonly known as a sinking fund to pay distributions on or redeem the interests at the end of the applicable nonwithdrawal period accordingly you will have to rely on our cash from operations and other sources of liquidity such as borrowed funds and proceeds from future offerings of securities for distributions payments and payments upon withdrawal our ability to generate revenues from operations in the future is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative statutory and other factors that are beyond our control moreover we cannot assure you that we will have access to additional sources of liquidity if our cash from operations are not sufficient to fund distributions to you our need for such additional sources may come at undesirable times such as during poor market or credit conditions when the costs of funds are high andor other terms are not as favorable as they would be during good market or credit conditions the cost of financing will directly impact our results of operations and financing on less than favorable terms may hinder our ability to make a profit your right to receive distributions on your interests is junior to the right of our general creditors to receive payments from us if we do not have sufficient funds to meet our anticipated future operating expenditures and debt repayment obligations as they become due then you could lose all or part of your investment we currently do not have any revenues you will have limited control over changes in our policies and operations which increases the uncertainty and risks you face as a limited partner our general partner determines our major policies including our policies regarding financing growth and debt capitalization our general partner may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the limited partners our general partners broad discretion in setting policies and our limited partners inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks you face as a limited partner in addition our general partner may change our investment objectives without seeking limited partner approval although our board has fiduciary duties to our limited partners and intends only to change our investment objectives when the board determines that a change is in the best interests of our limited partners a change in our investment objectives could cause a decline in the value of your investment in our company our ability to make distributions to our limited partners is subject to fluctuations in our financial performance operating results and capital improvement requirements currently our strategy includes paying a preferred return to investors under this offering that would result in a return of approximately  annualized return on investment of which there is no guarantee in the event of downturns in our operating results unanticipated capital improvements to our properties or other factors we may be unable to declare or pay distributions to our limited partners the timing and amount of distributions are the sole discretion of our general partner who will consider among other factors our financial performance any debt service obligations any debt covenants our taxable income and capital expenditure requirements we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash in order to fund distributions     investors will not receive the benefit of the regulations provided to real estate investment trusts or investment companies we are not a real estate investment trust and enjoy a broader range of permissible activities under the investment company act of  an investment company is defined as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of issuing faceamount certificates of the installment type or has been engaged in such business and has any such certificate outstanding or is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding  per centum of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis   we intend to operate in such manner as not to be classified as an investment company within the meaning of the investment company act of  as we intend on primarily holding real estate the management and the investment practices and policies of ours are not supervised or regulated by any federal or state authority as a result investors will be exposed to certain risks that would not be present if we were subjected to a more restrictive regulatory situation if we are deemed to be an investment company we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted if we are ever deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of  we may be subject to certain restrictions including   ·restrictions on the nature of our investments and ·restrictions on the issuance of securities in addition we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements including   ·registration as an investment company ·adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and ·reporting record keeping voting proxy compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations the exemption from the investment company act of  may restrict our operating flexibility failure to maintain this exemption may adversely affect our profitability we do not believe that at any time we will be deemed an investment company under the investment company act of  as we do not intend on trading or selling securities rather we intend to hold and manage real estate however if at any time we may be deemed an investment company we believe we will be afforded an exemption under section cc of the investment company act of  as amended referred to in this offering as the  act if you are going to abbreviate this this comment should go where the first mention of the act is which is the first paragraph of this page section cc of the  act excludes from regulation as an investment company any entity that is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate to qualify for this exemption we must ensure our asset composition meets certain criteria generally  of our assets must consist of qualifying mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate and the remaining  must consist of other qualifying real estatetype interests maintaining this exemption may adversely impact our ability to acquire or hold investments to engage in future business activities that we believe could be profitable or could require us to dispose of investments that we might prefer to retain if we are required to register as an investment company under the  act then the additional expenses and operational requirements associated with such registration may materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods      insurance risks we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance  the geographic areas in which we invest in notes may be at risk for damage to property due to certain weatherrelated and environmental events including such things as severe thunderstorms hurricanes flooding tornadoes snowstorm sinkholes and earthquakes to the extent possible the general partner may but is not required to attempt to acquire insurance against fire or environmental hazards however such insurance may not be available in all areas nor are all hazards insurable as some may be deemed acts of god or be subject to other policy exclusions  the general partner expects to obtain a lenders title insurance policy and will require that owners of property securing its notes maintain hazard insurance naming the company as the beneficiary all decisions relating to the type quality and amount of insurance to be placed on property securing its notes will be made exclusively by the general partner certain types of losses that may impact the security for the note could be of a catastrophic nature due to such things as ice storms tornadoes wind damage hurricanes earthquakes landslides sinkholes and floods some of which may be uninsurable not fully insured or not economically insurable this may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full prevailing market value or prevailing replacement cost of the underlying property inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the underlying property once it has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the property leaving the company without security for its notes furthermore an insurance company may deny coverage for certain claims andor determine that the value of the claim is less than the cost to restore the property and a lawsuit could have to be initiated to force them to provide coverage resulting in further losses in income to the company additionally properties securing the notes may now contain or come to contain mold which may not be covered by insurance and has been linked to health issues further when a borrower defaults on a note it is likely they will allow their hazard insurance to lapse the general partner will attempt to obtain its own insurance policies on such properties to the extent such lenders policies are available but it is possible that some of the properties securing the notes may be uninsured for a period of time or uninsurable if damage occurred during a time when a property was uninsured the company may suffer a loss of its security for a loan  federal income tax risks  the internal revenue service may challenge our characterization of material tax aspects of your investment in the interests an investment in interests involves material income tax risks which are discussed in detail in the section of this offering entitled tax treatment of company and its subsidiaries starting on page  you are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the federal state local and foreign tax considerations of an investment in our interests we may or may not seek any rulings from the internal revenue service regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein accordingly we cannot assure you that the tax conclusions discussed in this offering if contested would be sustained by the irs or any court in addition our legal counsel is unable to form an opinion as to the probable outcome of the contest of certain material tax aspects of the transactions described in this offering including whether we will be characterized as a dealer so that sales of our assets would give rise to ordinary income rather than capital gain and whether we are required to qualify as a tax shelter under the internal revenue code our counsel also gives no opinion as to the tax considerations to you of tax issues that have an impact at the individual or partner level      you may realize taxable income without cash distributions and you may have to use funds from other sources to fund tax liabilities as a limited partner of the company you will be required to report your allocable share of our taxable income on your personal income tax return regardless of whether you have received any cash distributions from us it is possible that your interests will be allocated taxable income in excess of your cash distributions we cannot assure you that cash flow will be available for distribution in any year as a result you may have to use funds from other sources to pay your tax liability you may not be able to benefit from any tax losses that are allocated to your interests interests may be allocated their share of tax losses should any arise section  of the internal revenue code limits the allowance of deductions for losses attributable to passive activities which are defined generally as activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate any tax losses allocated to investors will be characterized as passive losses and accordingly the deductibility of such losses will be subject to these limitations losses from passive activities are generally deductible only to the extent of a taxpayers income or gains from passive activities and will not be allowed as an offset against other income including salary or other compensation for personal services active business income or portfolio income which includes nonbusiness income derived from dividends interest royalties annuities and gains from the sale of property held for investment accordingly you may receive no benefit from your share of tax losses unless you are concurrently being allocated passive income from other sources we may be audited which could subject you to additional tax interest and penalties our federal income tax returns may be audited by the internal revenue service any audit of the company could result in an audit of your tax return the results of any such audit may require adjustments of items unrelated to your investment in addition to adjustments to various company items in the event of any such audit or adjustments you might incur attorneys fees court costs and other expenses in contesting deficiencies asserted by the internal revenue service you may also be liable for interest on any underpayment and penalties from the date your tax was originally due the tax treatment of all company items will generally be determined at the company level in a single proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with each partner and our general partner is primarily responsible for contesting federal income tax adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service in such a contest our manger may choose to extend the statute of limitations as to all partners and in certain circumstances may bind the partners to a settlement with the internal revenue service further our general partner may cause us to elect to be treated as an electing large company if it does we could take advantage of simplified flowthrough reporting of company items adjustments to company items would continue to be determined at the company level however and any such adjustments would be accounted for in the year they take effect rather than in the year to which such adjustments relate our general partner will have the discretion in such circumstances either to pass along any such adjustments to the partners or to bear such adjustments at the company level state and local taxes and a requirement to withhold state taxes may apply and if so the amount of net cash from open payable to you would be reduced the state in which you reside may impose an income tax upon your share of our taxable income further states in which we will own properties acquired through foreclosure may impose income taxes upon your share of our taxable income allocable to any company property located in that state many states have implemented or are implementing programs to require companies to withhold and pay state income taxes owed by nonresident partners relating to incomeproducing properties located in their states and we may be required to withhold state taxes from cash distributions otherwise payable to you you may also be required to file income tax returns in some states and report your share of income attributable to ownership and operation by the company of properties in those states in the event we are required to withhold state taxes from your cash distributions the amount of the net cash from operations otherwise payable to you would be reduced in addition such collection and filing requirements at the state level may result in increases in our administrative expenses that would have the effect of reducing cash available for distribution to you you are urged to consult with your own tax advisors with respect to the impact of applicable state and local taxes and state tax withholding requirements on an investment in our interests legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our interests additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect your taxation as a limited partner any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our interests or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties you are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in interests and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our interests      determination of offering price our offering price is arbitrary with no relation to value of

able to pursue an acquisition opportunity if it is unable to finance such acquisitions the company currently has no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through

return on investment by securing appropriate financing and ensuring efficient use of properties the company intends to analyze the highest and most suitable use of a particular property and when

related assets throughout the united states specifically in the western and southwestern united states initially the company intends to target senior care and multifamily properties but may acquire other property types that meet its investment objectives  the company may also purchase additional properties or make other real estate investments that relate to varying property types including office retail and industrial properties such property types may include operating properties properties under development and undeveloped properties such as land it is expected that the proceeds from this offering will initially be used to purchase multifamily properties and senior care facilities  we believe that there is an opportunity to create attractive total returns by employing a strategy of investing in a diversified portfolio of such investments which are wellselected wellmanaged and disposed of at an optimal time our principal targeted assets are investments in properties and other real estate investments that relate to properties that have quality construction and desirable locations which can attract quality tenants these types of investments are or relate to properties generally located in central business districts or suburban markets of primary and secondary metropolitan cities primarily located in the western and southwestern united states we intend to invest in a geographically diverse portfolio in order to reduce the risk of reliance on a particular market a particular property andor a particular tenant due diligence  financing when the company identifies a location or a potential property it will secure the necessary financing sign a contract and place an escrow deposit to be held with the designated escrow agent the company will take the minimum time necessary to complete all its due diligence to the property including site inspection reviewing all leases income and expenses as well as securing a first mortgage on the property after the due diligence process has been completed the company will determine whether the property is suitable or not  if property is not suitable the company will cancel the contract and look for the next opportunity refinancing during the initial  months of owning and managing the property the company will analyze the market conditions in the area where the project is located simultaneously they will investigate current interest rates the company will then decide whether the property should be maintained refinanced restructured ie condominium conversion or sold disposition       special purpose entities when the company does acquire real estate assets it intends to hold title to the properties through separate llcs or through special purpose entities spes holding several similar asset types each separate llc or spe will be a  whollyowned subsidiary of the company if a joint venture is undertaken the company will record a first position deed instead of holding actual title    ·each property acquired is its own entity and is structured as its own business structure while madyson equity group lp serves as the parent company that bundles all the ownership interests into a single corporation ·each property is managed by madyson equity group lp or its authorized agents leverage leverage represents an important vehicle for maximizing returns however the company will evaluate the appropriate amount of debt based on market conditions feasibility of the project and determined risk the company may borrow up to  of the capital raised in this offering or up to  of the value of the underlying assets of the company we may incur indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly or privately placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders the indebtedness may be secured or unsecured security may be in the form of mortgages or other interests in our properties equity interests in entities which own our properties or investments cash or cash equivalents securities letters of credit guarantees or a security interest in one or more of our other assets  the company may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties make other real estate investments make payments to the general partner pay for capital improvements repairs or tenant buildouts refinance existing indebtedness pay distributions or provide working capital the form of our indebtedness may be longterm or shortterm debt or in the form of a revolving credit facility financing strategy once the proceeds of this offering have been fully invested the company expects our debt financing will be in the range of approximately  to  of the aggregate value of our real estate investments and other assets financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at such later time as we determine to be appropriate  in addition debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements lease inducements tenant improvements and other working capital needs including the payment of distributions additionally the amount of debt placed on an individual property or related to a particular investment including our pro rata share of the amount of debt incurred by an individual entity in which we invest may be less than  or more than  of the value of such propertyinvestment or the value of the assets owned by such entity depending on market conditions and other factors  we will limit our borrowing to  of our equity investment notwithstanding the above depending on market conditions and other factors we may choose not to place debt on our portfolio or our assets and may choose not to borrow to finance our operations or to acquire properties our financing strategy and policies do not eliminate or reduce the risks inherent in using leverage to purchase properties      real estate investment life cycle as shown below the life cycle of a commercial real estate property varies on an individual property basis but generally all properties experience periods of development stabilization and decline the art of real estate investment is determining at what cycle to invest and ultimately when to exit a large part of being an effective real estate investor is knowing when to leave and not holding on to the property too long it is the view of the company that understanding and capitalizing on each period will maximize returns to investors  the company intends to purchase properties which the general partner believes will generate income from rents as well as growth from subsequent improved valuations the company will concentrate its investments on properties that   nproduce increasing streams of relatively stable income andnwill grow in value the company intends to concentrate its investments on real estate properties that   ntend to be at or below prevailing geographical market values andnprovide reasonably anticipated returns to investors     the general partner may elect and to expand or contract the companys capitalization as needed to prudently meet the demands for the investment market and to further assure that the rates of return for investors are met or exceeded the general partner believes that now is the time to position itself with purchasing a diverse portfolio real estate properties and real estaterelated assets with good market value and proven histories of producing income    the general partners goal is to purchase these properties as well as others as the market continues upward and that produce significant income initially the general intends to focus its investments to take advantage of the expanding need for senior living facilities throughout the us the aging us population will continue to drives the demand for senior housing the baby boomer generation generally those individuals born between  and  continue to enter their early to mids more than one in every eight americans roughly  of the population is  or older since  the percentage of americans  has more than tripled from  in  to  in  and the number has increased over thirteen times from  million to  million further as noted in the graph below the us census bureau projects that by  people  plus will outnumber those younger than  for the first time in history and that by  there will be  million americans  of the population  and older with more than  million over the age of    a recent us department of health and human services report notes that the percentage of the aged  and older plus population living in assisted living properties increases dramatically with age with  of those over age  needing longterm care or assistance with daily living activities and thats just the very old millions of others between  and  also choose or require either independent senior living or a facility offering one of the different levels of increasing care the us centers for disease control and prevention have found that over  of americans age  or older have multiple chronic illnesses which often limit their ability to perform basic tasks such as eating and bathing demand will only continue to increase the companys targeted acquisitions will be independent living and assisted living facilities these assets typically comprise a mix of private pay and medicaid eligible residentsfacts for features older americans month may  us census bureau release nocbff march   available at

rental package that may include transportation laundry meals and housekeeping but require little assistance with activities of daily living qualification for an independent living property includes a common dining facility that provides at least one daily meal as part of the monthly fee  currently the typical resident is a widowed female aged  years in relatively good health who lived in a nearby private home before choosing an independent living community across the us there are approximately than  investment grade independent living properties providing over  units as the population has aged the number of independent living properties has increased roughly twothirds of the existing properties in the countrys  largest metropolitan areas have been developed since  assisted living facilities  seniors who have no acute medical problems but who need help with different aspects of their daily lives often choose assisted living properties where they can enjoy both the amenities and the sense of community of an independent living community but where they are also offered supportive care with walking dressing eating bathing toileting and supervision of medications the move to assisted living is often need andor eventdriven perhaps by a fall declining memory or poor eating habits and the typical new resident needs assistance with two of the activities of daily living walking dressing eating etc  currently there are over  assisted living properties in the country providing nearly  separate units since  the assisted living sector has been in an expansion phase driven primarily by the aging population more than half of the current inventory in the largest metropolitan areas in the us has been developed since  this growth is expected to be ongoing recovering us

downward it currently sits at a four year low though it is still well above the historical average a continued regression to the historical average would be very beneficial to multifamily investors as more renters would move out on their own the improvement in unemployment will play an integral role in driving housing demand with most consumers unable to qualify for mortgages despite lower home prices consumer interest turned to rental housing imgsource bureau of labor statistics national investment center for seniors housing and care nic investment guide rd ed p  total shown do not include

 lagging new supply from  through  the last year of the housing boom an average of m housing units received permits annually since  the national average of new housing units permitted has been less

dropping unemployment as expected since peaking in  vacancy rates have steadily declined down towards their norms metropolitan areas with low vacancies have benefited from the tight rental market with

availability of assets that meet or investment criteria and the size of the assets to be acquired acquisition will depend highly on our funds the availability of those funds availability of assets that meet or investment criteria and the size of the assets to be acquired competition we will face competition from other owners investors and developers that are looking to acquire similar properties and who may implement or are already implementing a similar business plan to ours further we may be at a disadvantage to our competition who may have greater capital resources than we do specifically cash it has become increasingly difficult to obtain lending on many properties and those developers that are able to close without financing and pay the full purchase price of a property in cash may be able to close on more properties or will be able to negotiate better purchasing terms       tax treatment of company and its subsidiaries the following is a summary of certain relevant federal income tax considerations resulting from an investment in the company but does not purport to cover all of the potential tax considerations applicable to any specific purchaser prospective investors are urged to consult with and rely upon their own tax advisors for advice on these and other tax matters with specific reference to their own tax situation and potential changes in applicable law  taxation of undistributed fund income individual investors  under the laws pertaining to federal income taxation of limited partnerships no federal income tax is paid by the company as an entity each individual limited partner reports on his federal income tax return his distributive share of fund income gains losses deductions and credits whether or not any actual distribution is made to such limited partner during a taxable year each individual limited partner may deduct his distributive share of fund losses if any to the extent of the tax basis of his interests at the end of the company year in which the losses occurred the characterization of an item of profit or loss will usually be the same for the limited partner as it was for the company since individual limited partners will be required to include fund income in their personal income without regard to whether there are distributions of fund income such investors may become liable for federal and state income taxes on fund income even though they have received no cash distributions from the company with which to pay such taxes tax returns annually the company will provide the limited partners sufficient information from the companys informational tax return for such persons to prepare their individual federal state and local tax returns the companys informational tax returns will be prepared by certified public accountants selected by the general partner unrelated business taxable income  interests may be offered and sold to certain tax exempt entities such as qualified pension or profit sharing plans that otherwise meet the investor suitability standards described elsewhere in this offering circular see investor suitability standards such tax exempt entities generally do not pay federal income taxes on their income unless they are engaged in a business which generates unrelated business taxable income as that term is defined by section a of the code under the code tax exempt purchasers of interests may be deemed to be engaged in an unrelated trade or business by reason of rental or capital gains income earned by the company although rental and capital gains income which will constitute the primary sources of fund income ordinarily do not constitute unrelated business taxable income this exclusion does not apply to the extent interest income is derived from debtfinanced property to increase fund profits or increase fund liquidity the general partner may borrow funds in order to invest in properties this leveraging of the companys property portfolio will constitute an investment in debtfinanced property will be unrelated business income taxable to erisa plans unrelated business income is taxable only to the extent such income from all sources exceeds  per year the resulting tax known as ubit or unrelated business income tax is imposed based on the income tax brackets that apply to trusts such brackets are high and can quickly approach  before taking state  local income taxes into account on fairly small amounts of income ie –net income over  the remainder of a tax exempt investors income will continue to be exempt from federal income taxes to the extent it complies with other applicable provisions of law and the mere receipt of unrelated business income will not otherwise affect the qualification of an ira or erisa plan under the code the general partner does anticipate that the company would earn income based on its acquisition of leveraged rental properties that would be treated as ubti and therefore subject to ubit      the trustee of any trust that purchases interests in the company should consult with his tax advisors regarding the requirements for exemption from federal income taxation and the consequences of failing to meet such requirements in addition to carefully considering his fiduciary responsibilities with respect to such matters as investment diversification and the prudence of particular investments summary of partnership agreement the partnership agreement in the form attached hereto as exhibit  is the governing instrument establishing the terms and conditions pursuant to which the

conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and article  of regulation sx of the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec the partnership has elected to adopt early application of accounting standards update no  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements the partnership does not present or disclose inceptiontodate information and other remaining disclosure requirements of topic  the partnership adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting  use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates    f   cash equivalents and concentration of cash balance the partnership considers all highly liquid securities with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents the partnerships cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts at times may exceed federally insured limits fair value of financial instruments  financial accounting standards board fasb guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurement  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurement the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level  primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchangetraded instruments and listed equities level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly eg quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active level   unobservable inputs for the asset or liability financial instruments are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets approximate their fair value revenue recognition the partnership recognizes revenue when  persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collection is reasonably assured no revenue has been earned or recognized as of february   organizational costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  organizational costs including accounting fees legal fees and costs of incorporation are expensed as incurred    f  deferred offering costs the partnership complies with the requirements of fasb asc s deferred offering costs consist principally of legal fees incurred in connection with an offering the partnership intends to commence during  under regulation a prior to the completion of the offering these costs are capitalized as deferred offering costs on the balance sheet the deferred offering costs will be charged to members equity upon the completion of the offering or to expense if the offering is not completed  income taxes the partnership is a limited partnership accordingly under the internal revenue code all taxable income or loss flows through to its partners therefore no provision for income tax has been recorded in the statements income from the partnership is reported and taxed to the partners on their individual tax returns the partnership complies with fasb asc  for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a partnerships financial statements which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities fasb asc  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition based on the partnerships evaluation it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the partnerships financial statements the partnership believes that its income tax positions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position  the partnership may in the future become subject to federal state and local income taxation though it has not been since its inception the partnership is not presently subject to any income tax audit in any taxing jurisdiction  note  going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the partnership is a business that was recently formed and has not commenced planned principal operations plans to incur significant costs in pursuit of its capital financing plans and has not generated any revenues since inception the partnerships ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months is dependent upon its ability to obtain capital financing from investors sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such capital to produce profitable operating results no assurance can be given that the partnership will be successful in these efforts these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the partnership to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the partnership be unable to continue as a going concern    f   note  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which eliminated the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and stockholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no

after december   early application is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entitys financial statements have not yet been issued upon adoption entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by topic  the partnership has early adopted the new standard effective immediately in august  the fasb issued asu  on presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic   disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern currently there is no guidance in us gaap about managements responsibility  to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments in this update provide such guidance in doing so the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the amendments require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the amendments  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans  require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans  require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and  require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued the amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after december   early adoption is permitted the partnership has not elected to early adopt this pronouncement management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards
