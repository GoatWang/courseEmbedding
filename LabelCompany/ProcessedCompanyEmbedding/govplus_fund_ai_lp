companies including hedge fund giant citadel for losses sustained during the flash crash on may govplus master fund lp and govplus fund ai lp which are managed by dallasbased financial firm norcap say the chicago funds should give back  million that the govplus funds paid for put options the trades occurred as financial markets were going haywire with many prices plunging and then recovering in a brief period of afternoon tradingthe prices the govplus funds paid were probably based on some form of computer glitch that led to erroneous prices the lawsuit said the suit was filed this week in state court in illinois against citadel wolverine trading llc and chicago trading counder illinois law where a plaintiff has conferred a benefit upon a defendant and the defendants retention of that benefit would violate equity and good conscience the defendant must return the benefit the lawsuit said accusing the defendants of unjust enrichmentrepresentatives of citadel and wolverine said their firms had no comment on the lawsuit a representative of ctc could not be reachedbefore markets opened on may  the govplus funds had sold some standard  poors  index put options on the chicago board options exchange when markets plummeted the afternoon of may  the funds were on the hook for potentially huge lossesto limit their losses and comply with their risk management guidelines they bought put options on the sp  from citadel wolverine and ctc but the price of the options spiked during the crash from about  cents per contract to  per contract a  percent increase the lawsuit saidsubsequently us exchanges canceled more than  trades in more than  equities and equity derivatives in which prices changed by more than  percent during the flash crash the lawsuit said the chicago board options exchange only broke about  trades it saidearlier this year the cboe sent the govplus funds a letter saying the trades would not be nullified or adjusted according to the lawsuit the cboe official who wrote the letter could not be reached for comment according to a september report by the us securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission the flash crash was sparked by a large automated sell order by an institutional investor that ended up leading to waves of sellingduring the flash crash us equities markets failed investors the lawsuit said they gave the appearance that a historic fire was burning somewhere in the world causing the intrinsic value of us bellwether equities to plummet in reality there was no fire anywhere only a false alarm
