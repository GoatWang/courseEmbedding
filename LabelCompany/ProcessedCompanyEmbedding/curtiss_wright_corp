curtisswright came into existence on july   the result of a merger of  companies associated with curtiss aeroplane and motor company of buffalo new york and wright aeronautical of dayton ohio and was headquartered in buffalo new york with  million in capital equivalent to  billion in  it was the largest aviation company in the country companies merged owner wright aeronautical corp hoyt curtiss aeroplane  motor co keys curtiss airports corp keys curtiss flying service keys curtiss aeroplane export co keys curtisscaproni corp keys curtissrobertson airplane mfg co keys new york air terminals hoyt ny  suburban airlines hoyt keystone aircraft corp hoyt there were three main divisions the curtisswright airplane division which manufactured airframes the wright aeronautical corporation which produced aircraft engines and the curtisswright propeller division which manufactured propellers after  most engines produced by the new company were known as wrights while most aircraft were given the curtiss name with a few exceptions throughout the s curtisswright designed and built aircraft for military commercial and private markets but it was the wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the us military that would help the company through the difficult years of the great depression in  the company developed the p fighter aircraft resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the army air corps curtisswright also sold the p abroad where they were used in the early days of world war ii during world war ii curtisswright produced  aircraft engines  electric propellers and  airplanes curtisswright employed  workers and ranked second among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts behind only general motors the main building of the curtisswright company at caldwell new jersey in  curtisswright biggest aviation company expands its empire this here is an overall perspective of how curtisswrights business operations in the usa stretches all across the way from st louis to buffalo and how its newlymade products flow from the various factories for the us aircraft industry at that time in particular the map gets several things and points wrong particularly the location of production of the c aircraft which was actually built at buffalo and not at st louis this is from an article in life magazine on the th of september in  aircraft production included almost  p fighters made famous by their use by claire chennaults flying tigers in china over  c commando transport aircraft and later in the war over  sbc helldivers its most visible success came with the p variously known as the tomahawk kittyhawk and warhawk which were built between  and  at the main production facilities in buffalo new york during the war a second large plant was added at buffalo followed by new plants at columbus ohio st louis missouri and louisville kentucky engine and propeller production was at plants in new jersey pennsylvania and ohio in may  the us government assigned curtisswright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at louisville kentucky to produce the c caravan cargo plane which was constructed mostly of wood a nonpriority war material however after difficulties with the c including a crash of a production model in mid as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production plans for largescale c production were rejected the louisville plant was converted to c commando production eventually delivering  commandos to supplement the roughly  cs produced at buffalo the c cargo plane was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could carry more cargo at higher altitudes than any other allied aircraft consequently it was used extensively in the chinaburmaindia theater defective engines sold to us military in world war iiedit from  to  the curtiss aeronautical plant in lockland ohio produced aircraft engines under wartime contract destined for installation in us army air forces aircraft wright officials at lockland insisted on high engine production levels resulting in a significant percentage of engines that did not meet army air forces aaf inspection standards these defective engines were nevertheless approved by inspectors for shipment and installation in us military aircraft after investigation it was later revealed that wright company officials at lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and army inspection officers to approve substandard or defective aircraft engines for military use army air forces technical adviser charles w bond was dismissed by the army in  for gross irregularities in inspection procedure bond would later testify that he had been wined and dined by wright company officials one of those occasions was the night before bond fired four aaf engine inspectors another aaf inspector had described as troublemakers in  three army officers lt col frank constantine greulich of detroit former chief inspection officer for the material command major walter a ryan of detroit former central states inspection officer and major william bruckmann a former cincinnati brewer and resident army inspections officer at the wright plant in lockland were charged with neglect of duty conspiracy and giving false testimony in a general court martial all three men were later convicted of neglect of duty the story of defective engines had reached investigators working for sen harry trumans congressional investigative board the truman commission after several wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company they would later testify under oath before congress arthur millers play all my sons is based on this incident in  columnist richard j eskow senior fellow with the campaign for americas future and columnist for the huffington post alleged that his uncle jack temple died in world war ii temples death in a military bomber crash was allegedly tied to engine failure due to improper manufacture andor assembly the engines had passed inspection even though they were defective eskow referenced a  article by sarah anderson that appeared in the st louis postdispatch and on alternet anderson had alleged that curtisswright had sold leaky motors to the government and covered it up with forged inspection reports as a result of the investigation wrote anderson heads rolled at curtisswright and one general wound up in prison post–world war iiedit curtisswright failed to make the transition to design and production of jet aircraft despite several attempts during the war the company had expended only small amounts on aircraft research and development instead concentrating on incremental improvements in conventional aircraft already in wartime production this was especially true in the first two years of the war curtiss failure to research and develop more advanced wing and airframe designs provided an opening for north american bell lockheed northrop and other us aircraft manufacturers to submit newer and more advanced aircraft designs the p the firms last propdriven fighter design was merely an extrapolation of its s p hawk offering no advantage over other designs already in service with the rapid development of jet engine technology and nearsupersonic flight this technological lag resulted in curtiss losing a number of critical postwar military aircraft orders the final nail in the coffin was the choice of the northrop f scorpion over the xf blackhawk after the f was cancelled october   curtisswright shut down its entire aeroplane division and sold the assets to north american aviation while this marked curtisswrights departure from preeminence in the aviation industry one notable spinoff involved curtisswrights flight research laboratory founded in  near the main plant at the buffalo airport during divestiture of the airframe division the lab was given to cornell university along with a cash gift to finish construction of a transonic wind tunnel cornell aeronautical labs or cal as it was known was eventually spun off from the university as a private company calspan corporation which has been responsible for many subsequent innovations in flight and safety research for an aircraft company that failed largely due to lack of sufficient research and development during world war ii it is ironic that curtisswrights flight research division was one of the few parts of the oncehuge aviation conglomerate to survive to the present day after the government gave the development of the whittle jet engine to ge the company concentrated on reciprocating engines and propeller production for military transport and civilian airliners with the approaching twilight of the big piston aircraft engine curtisswright needed new design inspiration in  curtisswright licensed the sapphire jet engine from armstrong siddeley in the uk and manufactured it as the wright j it powered models of the martin b and several other us fighter planes subsequent derivative engines were late and did not find substantial markets for a brief time curtisswright licensed rights to the wankel rotary engine from nsu in  as a possible aircraft power plant for this major innovative engineering project curtisswright relied extensively on the design leadership of nsuwankel engineer max bentele in  united airlines bought four curtisswright flight simulators at a cost of  million these simulators were like earlier ones produced in the late s for airliners with the addition of visuals

automaker studebakerpackard corporation entered into a management agreement with curtisswright as a means for the nations fifth largest automobile manufacturer to avoid insolvency the relationship

manufactured airframes the wright aeronautical corporation which produced aircraft engines and the curtisswright propeller division which manufactured propellers after  most engines produced by the new company were known as wrights while most aircraft were given the curtiss name with a few exceptions throughout the s curtisswright designed and built aircraft for military commercial and private markets but it was the wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the us military that would help the company through the difficult years of the great depression in  the company developed the p fighter aircraft resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the army air corps curtisswright also sold the p abroad where they were used in the early days of world war ii during world war ii curtisswright produced  aircraft engines  electric propellers and  airplanes curtisswright employed  workers and ranked second among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts behind only general motors the main building of the curtisswright company at caldwell new jersey in  curtisswright biggest aviation company expands its empire this here is an overall perspective of how curtisswrights business operations in the usa stretches all across the way from st louis to buffalo and how its newlymade products flow from the various factories for the us aircraft industry at that time in particular the map gets several things and points wrong particularly the location of production of the c aircraft which was actually built at buffalo and not at st louis this is from an article in life magazine on the th of september in  aircraft production included almost  p fighters made famous by their use by claire chennaults flying tigers in china over  c commando transport aircraft and later in the war over  sbc helldivers its most visible success came with the p variously known as the tomahawk kittyhawk and warhawk which were built between  and  at the main production facilities in buffalo new york during the war a second large plant was added at buffalo followed by new plants at columbus ohio st louis missouri and louisville kentucky engine and propeller production was at plants in new jersey pennsylvania and ohio in may  the us government assigned curtisswright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at louisville kentucky to produce the c caravan cargo plane which was constructed mostly of wood a nonpriority war material however after difficulties with the c including a crash of a production model in mid as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production plans for largescale c production were rejected the louisville plant was converted to c commando production eventually delivering  commandos to supplement the roughly  cs produced at buffalo the c cargo plane was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could carry more cargo at higher altitudes than any other allied aircraft consequently it was used extensively in the chinaburmaindia theater defective engines sold to us military in world war iiedit from  to  the

companies associated with curtiss aeroplane and motor company of buffalo new york and wright aeronautical of dayton ohio and was headquartered in buffalo new york with  million in capital equivalent

were three main divisions the curtisswright airplane division which manufactured airframes the wright aeronautical corporation which produced aircraft engines and the curtisswright propeller division which manufactured propellers after  most engines produced by the new company were known as wrights while most aircraft were given the curtiss name with a few exceptions throughout the s curtisswright designed and built aircraft for military commercial and private markets but it was the wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the us military that would help the company through the difficult years of the great depression in  the company developed the p fighter aircraft resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the army air corps curtisswright also sold the p abroad where they were used in the early days of world war ii during world war ii curtisswright produced  aircraft engines  electric propellers and  airplanes curtisswright employed  workers and ranked second among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts behind only general motors the main building of the curtisswright company at caldwell new jersey in  curtisswright biggest aviation company expands its empire this here is an overall perspective of how curtisswrights business operations in the usa stretches all across the way from st louis to buffalo and how its newlymade products flow from the various factories for the us aircraft industry at that time in particular the map gets several things and points wrong particularly the location of production of the c aircraft which was actually built at buffalo and not at st louis this is from an article in life magazine on the th of september in  aircraft production included almost  p fighters made famous by their use by claire chennaults flying tigers in china over  c commando transport aircraft and later in the war over  sbc helldivers its most visible success came with the p variously known as the tomahawk kittyhawk and warhawk which were built between  and  at the main production facilities in buffalo new york during the war a second large plant was added at buffalo followed by new plants at columbus ohio st louis missouri and louisville kentucky engine and propeller production was at plants in new jersey pennsylvania and ohio in may  the us government assigned curtisswright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at louisville kentucky to produce the c caravan cargo plane which was constructed mostly of wood a nonpriority war material however after difficulties with the c including a crash of a production model in mid as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production plans for largescale c production were rejected the louisville plant was converted to c commando production eventually delivering  commandos to supplement the roughly  cs produced at buffalo the c cargo plane was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could carry more cargo at higher altitudes than any other allied aircraft consequently it was used extensively in the chinaburmaindia theater defective

aeroplane and motor company of buffalo new york and wright aeronautical of dayton ohio and was headquartered in buffalo new york with  million in capital equivalent to  billion in  it was the largest aviation company in the country companies merged owner wright aeronautical corp hoyt curtiss aeroplane  motor co keys curtiss airports corp keys curtiss flying service keys curtiss aeroplane export co keys curtisscaproni corp keys curtissrobertson airplane mfg co keys new york air terminals hoyt ny  suburban airlines hoyt keystone aircraft corp hoyt there were three main divisions the curtisswright airplane division which manufactured airframes the wright aeronautical corporation which produced aircraft engines and the curtisswright propeller division which manufactured propellers after  most engines produced by the new company were known as wrights while most aircraft were given the curtiss name with a few exceptions throughout the s curtisswright designed and built aircraft for military commercial and private markets but it was the wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the us military that would help the company through the difficult years of the great depression in  the company developed the p fighter aircraft resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the army air corps curtisswright also sold the p abroad where they were used in the early days of world war ii during world war ii curtisswright produced  aircraft engines  electric propellers and  airplanes curtisswright employed  workers and ranked second among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts behind only general motors the main building of the curtisswright company at caldwell new jersey in  curtisswright biggest aviation company expands its empire this here is an overall perspective of how curtisswrights business operations in the usa stretches all across the way from st louis to buffalo and how its newlymade products flow from the various factories for the us aircraft industry at that time in particular the map gets several things and points wrong particularly the location of production of the c aircraft which was actually built at buffalo and not at st louis this is from an article in life magazine on the th of september in  aircraft production included almost  p fighters made famous by their use by claire chennaults flying tigers in china over  c commando transport aircraft and later in the war over  sbc helldivers its most visible success came with the p variously known as the tomahawk kittyhawk and warhawk which were built between  and  at the main production facilities in buffalo new york during the war a second large plant was added at buffalo followed by new plants at columbus ohio st louis missouri and louisville kentucky engine and propeller production was at plants in new jersey pennsylvania and ohio in may  the us government assigned curtisswright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at louisville kentucky to produce the c caravan cargo plane which was constructed mostly of wood a nonpriority war material however after difficulties with the c including a crash of a production model in mid as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production plans for largescale c production were rejected the louisville plant was converted to c commando production eventually delivering  commandos to supplement the roughly  cs produced at buffalo the c cargo plane was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could carry more cargo at higher altitudes than any other allied aircraft consequently it was used extensively in the chinaburmaindia theater defective engines sold to us military in world war iiedit from  to  the curtiss aeronautical plant in lockland ohio produced aircraft engines under wartime contract destined for installation in us army air forces aircraft wright officials at lockland insisted on high engine production levels resulting in a significant percentage of engines that did not meet army air forces aaf inspection standards these defective engines were nevertheless approved by inspectors for shipment and installation in us military aircraft after investigation it was later revealed that wright company officials at lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and army inspection officers to approve substandard or defective aircraft engines for military use army air forces technical adviser charles w bond was dismissed by the army in  for gross irregularities in inspection procedure bond would later testify that he had been wined and dined by wright company officials one of those occasions was the night before bond fired four aaf engine inspectors another aaf inspector had described as troublemakers in  three army officers lt col frank constantine greulich of detroit former chief inspection officer for the material command major walter a ryan of detroit former central states inspection officer and major william bruckmann a former cincinnati brewer and resident army inspections officer at the wright plant in lockland were charged with neglect of duty conspiracy and giving false testimony in a general court martial all three men were later convicted of neglect of duty the story of defective engines had reached investigators working for sen harry trumans congressional investigative board the truman commission after several wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company they would later testify under oath before congress arthur millers play all my sons is based on this incident in  columnist richard j eskow senior fellow with the campaign for americas future and columnist for the huffington post alleged that his uncle jack temple died in world war ii temples death in a military bomber crash was allegedly tied to engine failure due to improper manufacture andor assembly the engines had passed inspection even though they were defective eskow referenced a  article by sarah anderson that appeared in the st louis postdispatch and on alternet anderson had alleged that curtisswright had sold leaky motors to the government and covered it up with forged inspection reports as a result of the investigation wrote anderson heads rolled at curtisswright and one general wound up in prison post–world war iiedit curtisswright failed to make the transition to design and production of jet aircraft despite several attempts during the war the company had expended only small amounts on aircraft research and development instead concentrating on incremental improvements in conventional aircraft already in wartime production this was especially true in the first two years of the war curtiss failure to research and develop more advanced wing and airframe designs provided an opening for north american bell lockheed northrop and other us aircraft manufacturers to submit newer and more advanced aircraft designs the p the firms last propdriven fighter design was merely an extrapolation of its s p hawk offering no advantage over other designs already in service with the rapid development of jet engine technology and nearsupersonic flight this technological lag resulted in curtiss losing a number of critical postwar military aircraft orders the final nail in the coffin was the choice of the northrop f scorpion over the xf blackhawk after the f was cancelled october   curtisswright shut down its entire aeroplane division and sold the assets to north american aviation while this marked curtisswrights departure from preeminence in the aviation industry one notable spinoff involved curtisswrights flight research laboratory founded in  near the main plant at the buffalo airport during divestiture of the airframe division the lab was given to cornell university along with a cash gift to finish construction of a transonic wind tunnel cornell aeronautical labs or cal as it was known was eventually spun off from the university as a private company calspan corporation which has been responsible for many subsequent innovations in flight and safety research for an aircraft company that failed largely due to lack of sufficient research and development during world war ii it is ironic that curtisswrights flight research division was one of the few parts of the oncehuge aviation conglomerate to survive to the present day after the government gave the development of the whittle jet engine to ge the company concentrated on reciprocating engines and propeller production for military transport and civilian airliners with the approaching twilight of the big piston aircraft engine curtisswright needed new design inspiration in  curtisswright licensed the sapphire jet engine from armstrong siddeley in the uk and manufactured it as the wright j it powered models of the martin b and several other us fighter planes subsequent derivative engines were late and did not find substantial markets for a brief time curtisswright licensed rights to the wankel rotary engine from nsu in  as a possible aircraft power plant for this major innovative engineering project curtisswright relied extensively on the design leadership of nsuwankel engineer max bentele in  united airlines bought four curtisswright flight simulators at a cost of  million these simulators were like earlier ones produced in the late s for airliners with the addition of visuals sound and movement they were the first of todays modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft curtisswright travel air cwq at cotswold airport gloucestershire england in  financially strapped automaker studebakerpackard corporation entered into a management agreement with curtisswright as a means for the nations fifth largest automobile manufacturer to avoid insolvency the relationship lasted until  at which time curtisswright withdrew from the agreement the shift of
