the questions he asked himself was “how can i add value to thiscompany” looking at the business portfolio of the  mandarin oriental properties at thetime he knew he had inherited a collection of firstclass hotels that were consistently ratedamong the top three in their respective destinations including hong kong and bangkokmandarin oriental was known as an asiabased hotel group with a strong balance sheetsignificant ownership of its properties which typically served highend corporate executivesand an extraordinary brand reputation in asia where  out of its  hotels were locatedhowever it was also clear that the group had “a very limited brand profile outside of asia” atthat point in timeettedgui felt that more could be done with the group by transforming it into an internationalbrand and he had the ultimate aspiration of creating a brand that stood for ‘legendary’ hotelssucceeding in key cities like new york london paris tokyo and hong kong would have ahuge impact on any luxury brand but for mandarin oriental it would make future expansionwithin or beyond asia even more likely and impactful he also believed that in the futureleisure as opposed to business guests would define the brandwith this vision in mind he began working with his key executives to craft the plan forbringing the brand to the rest of the world in  ettedgui and his team launched thegroup’s very first global advertising campaign for the brand previous advertising effortswere managed by and focused on individual hotel properties the company hired mcsaatchi to design the “shehe’s a fan” campaign which was shot by the world famousphotographer and british royal lord lichfield the campaign elegantly connected thegroup’s wellrecognised symbol – the fan – with international celebrities such as michelleyeoh im pei and lance armstrong who regularly stayed at the hotels and were fans of thegroupthe  million campaign focused on the usa and western europe the two markets thataccounted “for the majority of high net worth individuals’ wealth” according to the worldwealth report  by capgemini and merrill lynch the campaign’s core theme focusingon the brand as a whole rather than individual hotel properties made an enormous impact forthe group and was an immense success with one of the highest recall rates magazines with aluxury leisure focus such as architectural digest and condé nast

company or investors another group of competitors were thosewith an asian service concept andor similar focus on internationalisation such as shangrila raffles and banyan treesecondly within each destination the group defined five primary competitor hotels basedstrictly on standards of luxury and geographical proximity regardless of the brandthe brandmandarin oriental hotel group’s brand was strongly identified with subdued elegancetraditional oriental values and the concept of “delighting our guests” for the group’sdefinition of “delight” see exhibit “mandarin oriental stood for st century luxury with oriental charm” said ettedgui tohim st century luxury was the right mix of tradition quality and innovation looking at thecompetition consisting of mostly management contractdriven incumbents ettedgui believedthat the group’s ownership or significant interest in hotel properties enabled proprietarycontrol of all aspects of the hotel and its services thereby allowing it to take risks to innovatecustomise and differentiate particularly as “all innovations in the industry came from owneroperated hotels” at mandarin oriental st century luxury was achieved via the use oftechnology food and beverage offerings and the mandarin oriental spa while integratingthe unique sense of place and culture of each destination the group’s hotels reflected orientalcharm in the hospitality experience through subtle asian touches in its dining offerings spaservices decor and staff edouard ettedgui interview by mos project group insead  april  ibidcopyright   insead  mandarin oriental’s strength ultimately derived from the customer’s belief in what the brandstood for ie the guests defined the brand while the perception of a ‘legendary’ hotel wasrather intangible and subjective guests often recalled specific memories or experiences at oneor more hotels when expressing appreciation for the brand these vignettes were often passedon from guest to guest a typical example came from a customer of the terrace restaurant ofthe mandarin oriental hyde park london where “a terrace butler was on hand on hotsummer days with a selection of sunscreens cooling iced towers water sprays and sunglassescleaning service…” furthermore ettedgui and his team believed that generations of localpatrons were central to mandarin oriental’s two legendary hotels in hong kong andbangkok the hotel lobby and its adjacent captain’s bar at mandarin oriental hong kongwere popular meeting venues for local senior executives and decision makers while theclipper lounge on its mezzanine floor was one of hong kongs most popular places for hightea among local socialites and ladies of societywhile each and every mandarin oriental hotel delivered exceptional services ettedguibelieved that building and enhancing the brand was the only way to fully capture andarticulate the value of the collective strengths of all mandarin oriental hotels with theultimate aspiration of creating a brand that stood for ‘legendary’ hotels the management teamaligned corporate strategy at every customer touchpoint to strengthen global brand recognitionvia building critical mass developing a more balanced geographical coverage and leveragingcore competencies and heritageunder the leadership of ettedgui the group underwent international expansion from its hotels in  with a plan to establish more than  rooms in a portfolio of more than hotels around the world over the next few years for the group’s development timeline seeexhibit  according to witt as the management team grew the brand on the basis of the‘legendary’ image the team would manage it “as a luxury brand rather than a hotel brand”highly brand focused it evaluated new hotel projects based on whether they “have thepotential to be a legendary hotel in the community or its resort over time and have the abilityto add value to the existing hotels”at mandarin oriental the food and beverage offerings the spas and the consistent delivery ofexceptional service enabled the brand to communicate to two target audiences the localcommunity and travellers over time the brand as a whole had become far greater than thesum of these individual elementsfood  beverage offeringscontrary to the generic industry model whereby hotel restaurants were mainly a cost centrefor the purpose of servicing guests mandarin

in its hotels many of which had over time becomepopular in the local community for regular dining such as business lunches betweenexecutives social meals among friends and family as well as celebratory events like weddingbanquets it was not uncommon to find at least two restaurants in each of its hotels thatcatered to the varying needs of international travellers as well as to a local clienteleconsistent delivery of exceptional servicethe management team saw exceptional service as the “crux of everything” the essentialingredient for any hotel to become legendary the group had come a long way from verballyhanding down service traditions to sharing written standards among individual hoteloperations and now to measuring performance via a proprietary standard – legendaryquality experiences lqe over time the group incorporated guest feedbackcommissioned detailed consumer research and hired professionals to define elegant yetauthentic service with the help of cuttingedge technology and rigorously trained staff toensure consistent delivery of exceptional servicethe spa at mandarin orientala definitive brand identifier championed by ettedgui in  – the development of the spa atmandarin oriental – was aligned with the company’s goal of providing “st century luxurywith oriental charm” its brand heritage and name as spas were already very much part ofthe culture in thailand india japan and china at that time spas typically existed in resortdestinations not the urban locations where mandarin oriental and its competitors operatedduring a threeweek trip to northern india with their wives ettedgui and his team wereintroduced to and experienced ayurvedic spa and yoga they assessed the validity andfeasibility of implementing the spa experience in every mandarin oriental hotel andconsidered whether or not to ultimately incorporate the spa experience into the brandwhile spas were costly to build and had a generally lower return rate per unit area than that ofhotel rooms ettedgui saw their potential to attract customers who would pay a premium for aquality spa service and more importantly choose to stay at the hotel specifically for the spaexperience equally if defined and implemented well spas could be a unique tangible andcredible element of mandarin oriental’s holistic ambience and experience that would furtherdistinguish the brand from its competitors enabling it to attract a leisure audience and furtherheighten its prestigeleveraging this thinking mandarin oriental bangkok’s existing spa operation the world’sfirst wellknown hotel spa and experts recruited from the spa industry the spa at mandarinoriental was built to provide an exclusive highly personalised and holistic approach towellness in a generous space offering therapies including chinese ayurvedic and europeanalternative treatments from yoga to pilates impressive heat and water therapies privaterelaxation spa cuisine and bespoke spa products it was well known that “one does not cometo the mandarin oriental spa for a quick onehour appointment” the spa offered “time edouard ettedgui interview by mos project group insead  april  ibid “like mother like daughter” condé nast traveller february copyright   insead  rituals” and “journey experiences akin to a rite of passage” over the years the spa atmandarin oriental had become a prominent yet integral part of the holistic hospitalityexperience they were regularly featured in various media particularly those with a luxuryleisure audience further enhancing the group’s appeal to travellers around the world and tothe local communitynext stop …new yorkever since its inception the group had strongly focused on a real estatedriven strategyowning a significant equity share in its hotels while ettedgui believed that control over theproperties allowed management to take risks and innovate which was key to the success ofany luxury brand he made it his mandate to fully leverage the power of the brand and todevelop mandarin oriental at the international level executing this mandate was particularlychallenging at the beginning as the group had a limited brand profile outside asia the orderof expansion into new geographical boundaries was unclear and it was unfamiliar withspecific locations to ettedgui north america was a major market in which the company hadto strengthen its overall corporate presence in order to become an international brand thatwas strong both within and outside asia it was therefore logical that this market became thefocus of mandarin oriental’s first global branding campaign as a destination new york wasabsolutely essential not only was it among the world’s top three cities but it was also thecentre of the luxury media industry at the time ettedgui noted “new york is also an important feeder market for mandarin oriental hotel group’s properties manhattan is achieving exceptionally high occupancies and rates within the luxury hotel sector with limited additional room supply anticipated in the near future”the management team asked themselves several key questions how would the flagship hotelin new york be developed what were the absolute essentials of the brand what woulddefine mandarin oriental new york regarding the first question the management team hadtwo potential options to acquire and transform an existing hotel or to work with a developerto build a brand new hotel in reality the availability of prime location sites or propertieswould very much drive the decision the latter questions were more abstract and a delicatebalance would need to be achieved between the two to the management team all threequestions were intertwinedconceiving mandarin oriental new yorkmandarin oriental group aimed to preserve the core brand values of its holistic hospitalityexperience in new york however it was unclear how it would be received in new york adestination that was far removed from asia both in terms of culture and distance anotherunknown was how mandarin oriental could succeed as a brand with a “very limited brand ibid ettedgui edouard “the way forward” mandarin oriental group internal publication  “mandarin oriental announces luxury hotel in new york”  september  the mandarin oriental website wwwmandarinorientalcom  september copyright   insead  profile outside of asia” would mandarin oriental new york be able to become a legendaryhotel appealing to local patrons in new york like its counterparts in bangkok and hongkong this was another uncertaintywhile the importance of consistent delivery of exceptional service was indisputablereplicating mandarin oriental’s very own exceptional service model was consideredimpossible by many from outside of the group based on their belief that cheap labour costs inasia was the precondition for this model – labour costs were known to be high in new yorkin addition a quick scan of factors such as dining and leisure habits in new york at that timerevealed potential differences in the perception of hotel restaurants and spas as outlinedbelowin asia restaurants had been much better integrated into hotels generating revenues fromlocal patrons as well as travelers whereas in new york restaurants in luxury hotels wereoffered as a service to guests rather than a serious part of hotel operations at worst they wereseen as a “necessary evil” and tended to be viewed as cost centres the best restaurants werenot to be found in hotels because hoteliers focused mainly on international travellers whotypically went to the hotel restaurant for breakfastfurthermore introducing the spa concept would be controversial at the time full urban spaswere a new concept to new york and involved expensive investment in terms of propertyspace and operating costs stinson as development director shared the views of mostproperty developers his priority was to extract maximum value from every investment whileacknowledging the mandarin oriental spa as an important brand identifier he was concernedabout the high costs involved and the uncertain return from the spa business in this very newmarkethowever ettedgui was passionate about introducing the full brand experience to new yorkhe was also confident that travellers would be willing to pay a premium for a quality spaexperience and that the spa would attract leisure business from both locals and travellers whowould otherwise not come to the hotel at all in his view in the scheme of building legendaryhotels the hotel’s reputation would ultimately depend upon leisure customers rather thancorporate travellers the full spa offering in an urban setting would be particularly importantin attracting the right customers to this key destination it would also help position the hotelin the local community as the fullness of the experience would also attract local patronsas ettedgui walked to the conference room to meet the rest of the team in preparation for theupcoming discussion with potential developers in new york he wondered how mandarinoriental new york would ultimately be defined john witt interview by jessica zee and gabriel szulanski insead  october copyright   insead
