trust the framework under the standard is comprised of a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level  quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the trust has the ability to access as of the measurement date level  significant observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data level  significant unobservable inputs that reflect a trusts own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with

internet at wwwaamportfolioscom the public offering price of units includes  the net asset value per unit plus  the sales fee plus  accrued interest if any the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price

that they receive to us in a timely manner certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security from the last day it paid interest accrued interest on the trust units consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds interest on the bonds is generally paid semi annually although the trust accrues such interest daily because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trusts interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions as a result interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to advance funds in connection with such interest distributions if you sell or redeem your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of

investors in the market are willing to pay to buy a security the bid side evaluation is lower than the offering side evaluation sales fee you pay a fee in connection with purchasing units we refer to

monthly distributions your trust generally pays interest from its net investment income prorated on an annual basis along with any available principal paid on the securities on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust  understanding your investment might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as interest and principal payments change or trust expenses change interest received by the trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest is credited by the trustee to the trusts interest account other receipts are credited to the principal account after deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the trustee without interest for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date all distributions will be net of estimated expenses funds in the principal account will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date provided that the amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least  per unit because interest payments are not received by the trust at a constant rate throughout the year interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the interest account on the next record date investors who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the purchase estimated distributions the estimated net annual interest income per unit and estimated normal monthly distribution per unit are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus as of the date set forth herein we base these amounts on the estimated cash flows of the bonds per unit the actual distributions that you receive will vary from these estimates with changes in expenses interest rates and maturity call default or sale of bonds you may request the estimated cash flows from the sponsor the estimated cash flows are computed based on factors described under understanding your investmenthow the trust worksestimated current and long term returns reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee or your financial professional will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the principal value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a understanding your investment  securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities will fall if interest rates increase the securities in your trust typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall securities with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a securitys issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the schedule of investments bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating high yield bond risk the trust may invest in high yield bonds or unrated bonds high yield high risk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than bonds with higher investment ratings the value of these bonds will decline significantly with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments highyield or junk bonds the generic names for bonds rated below bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed bonds rated below bbb or baa are considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade because highyield bonds are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated bonds their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree the market for highyield bonds is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade bonds due to the smaller less liquid market for highyield bonds the bidoffer spread on such bonds is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds and the purchase or sale of such bonds may take longer to complete  understanding your investment concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular type of bond because the portfolio concentrates in bonds of that type a portfolio concentrates in a type of bond when bonds in a particular category make up  or more of the portfolio the table under types of bonds under the investment summary section for your trust lists the type of bonds held by the trust with the percentage that each type represents in the portfolio general obligation bonds certain of the bonds in your trust may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are secured by the taxing power of the entity general obligation bonds are backed by the issuers pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited however by provisions of state constitutions or laws an entitys credit will depend on many factors tax base reliance on federal or state aid and factors which are beyond the entitys control revenue bonds certain of the bonds in your trust may be revenue bonds that are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes if any the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project or authority falters because that income is the only source of payment the following types of bonds are revenue bonds appropriations bonds certain bonds in your trust may be bonds that are in whole or in part subject to and dependent upon either the governmental entity making appropriations from time to time or the continued existence of special temporary taxes which require legislative action for their reimposition the availability of any appropriation is subject to the willingness or ability of the governmental entity to continue to make such special appropriations or to reimpose such special taxes the obligation to make lease payments exists only to the extent of the monies available to the governmental entity therefor and no liability is incurred by the governmental entity beyond the monies so appropriated once an annual appropriation is made the governmental entitys obligation to make lease rental payments is absolute and unconditional regardless of any circumstances or occurrences which might arise in the event of nonappropriation certificateholders or bondowners sole remedy absent credit enhancement generally is limited to repossession of the collateral for resale or releasing in the event of nonappropriation we may instruct the trustee to sell such bonds airport port and highway bonds certain facility revenue bonds are payable from and secured by the revenues from the ownership and operation of particular facilities such as airports highways and port authorities airport operating income may be affected by the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under the agreements with airports similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as use fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors and increased cost of maintenance or decreased use of a facility the sponsor cannot predict what effect conditions may have on revenues which are dependent for payment on these bonds capital improvement facility bonds your trust may contain bonds which are in the capital improvement facilities category capital improvement bonds are bonds issued to provide funds to understanding your investment  assist political subdivisions or agencies of a state through acquisition of the underlying debt of a state or local political subdivision or agency the risks of an investment in such bonds include the risk of possible prepayment or failure of payment of proceeds on and default of the underlying debt convention facility bonds your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the convention facilities category bonds in the convention facilities category include special limited obligation bonds issued to finance convention and sports facilities payable from rental payments and annual governmental appropriations the governmental agency is not obligated to make payments in any year in which the monies have not been appropriated to make such payments in addition these facilities are limited use facilities that may not be used for purposes other than as convention centers or sports facilities correctional facility bonds your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the correctional facilities category bonds in the correctional facilities category include special limited obligation bonds issued to construct rehabilitate and purchase correctional facilities payable from governmental rental payments andor appropriations education university and college bonds the ability of educational institutions including universities and colleges to meet their obligations is dependent upon various factors some of these factors include the size and diversity of their sources of revenues enrollment reputation management expertise the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds the quality and maintenance costs of campus facilities also in the case of public institutions the financial condition of the relevant state or other governmental entity and its policies with respect to education may affect an institutions ability to make payment on its own hospital and health care facility bonds the ability of hospitals and other health care facilities to meet their obligations with respect to revenue bonds issued on their behalf is dependent on various factors some such factors are the level of payments received from private thirdparty payors and government programs and the cost of providing health care services there can be no assurance that payments under governmental programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs associated with these bonds it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility housing bonds multifamily housing revenue bonds and single family mortgage revenue bonds are state and local housing issues that have been issued to provide financing for various housing projects multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families singlefamily mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring notes secured by mortgages on residences the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issues and the  understanding your investment ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims all single family mortgage revenue bonds and certain multifamily housing revenue bonds are prepayable over the life of the underlying mortgage or mortgage pool therefore the average life of housing obligations cannot be determined however the average life of these obligations will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities mortgage loans are frequently partially or completely prepaid prior to their final stated maturities to the extent that these obligations were valued at a premium when a unitholder purchased units any prepayment at par would result in a loss of capital to the unitholder and reduce the amount of income that would otherwise have been paid to unitholders industrial development revenue bonds idrs idrs including pollution control revenue bonds are taxexempt bonds issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities idrs are not general obligations of governmental entities backed by their taxing power issuers are only obligated to pay amounts due on the idrs to the extent that funds are available from the unexpended proceeds of the idrs or receipts or revenues of the issuer payment of idrs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor such corporate operators or guarantors that are industrial companies may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry lease rental bonds lease rental bonds are predominantly issued by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings or the purchase of equipment that will be used by a state or local government thus the bonds are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the bonds lease rental bonds are subject to the risk that the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year these bonds are also subject to the risk of abatement in many states as rental payments cease in the event that damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee also in the event of default by the lessee government there may be significant legal andor practical difficulties involved in the reletting or sale of the project moral obligation bonds your trust may also include moral obligation bonds if an issuer of moral obligation bonds is unable to meet its obligations the repayment of the bonds becomes a moral commitment but not a legal obligation of the state or municipality in question thus such a commitment generally requires appropriation by the state legislature and accordingly does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation on debt of the state the agencies or authorities issuing moral obligation bonds generally have no taxing power power bonds the ability of utilities to meet their obligations with respect to bonds they issue is dependent on various factors these factors include the rates they may charge their customers the demand for a utilitys services and the cost of providing those services utilities may also be subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates which they may charge customers utilities can experience regulatory political and consumer resistance to rate increases utilities engaged in longterm capital projects are especially sensitive understanding your investment  to regulatory lags in granting rate increases utilities are additionally subject to increased costs due to governmental environmental regulation and decreased profits due to increasing competition any difficulty in obtaining timely and adequate rate increases could adversely affect a utilitys results of operations the sponsor cannot predict at this time the ultimate effect of such factors on the ability of any issuers to meet their obligations with respect to bonds refunded bonds refunded bonds are typically secured by direct obligations of the us government or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the us government placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent party until maturity or a predetermined redemption date these obligations are generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date in a few isolated instances to date however bonds which were thought to be escrowed to maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity solid waste disposal bonds bonds issued for solid waste disposal facilities are generally payable from tipping fees and from revenues that may be earned by the facility on the sale of electrical energy generated in the combustion of waste products the ability of solid waste disposal facilities to meet their obligations depends upon the continued use of the facility the successful and efficient operation of the facility and in the case of wastetoenergy facilities the continued ability of the facility to generate electricity on a commercial basis also increasing environmental regulation at the federal state and local level has a significant impact on waste disposal facilities while regulation requires most waste producers to use waste disposal facilities it also imposes significant costs on the facilities special tax bonds special tax bonds are payable for and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room on the purchase of food and beverages on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the municipality and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax also should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to the special tax decline the municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking taxable base tax allocation bonds tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment projects financed by bond proceeds are located bond payments are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates special risk considerations include variations in taxable values of property in the project area successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations substantial delinquencies in the payment of property taxes or imposition of any constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease transit authority bonds mass transit is generally not selfsupporting from fare revenues additional financial resources must be made available to ensure operation of mass transit systems as well as the timely payment of debt service often such financial resources include federal and state subsidies lease rentals paid by funds of the state or local government or a pledge of a special tax if  understanding your investment fare revenues or the additional financial resources do not increase appropriately to pay for rising operating expenses the ability of the issuer to adequately service the debt may be adversely affected water and sewer revenue bonds water and sewer bonds are generally payable from user fees the ability of state and local water and sewer authorities to meet their obligations may be affected by a number of factors some such factors are the failure of municipalities to utilize fully the facilities constructed by these authorities declines in revenue from user charges the possible inability to obtain rate increases rising construction and maintenance costs impact of environmental requirements the difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs the impact of no growth zoning ordinances and the continued availability of federal and state financial assistance and of municipal bond insurance for future bond issues liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on securities when issued and delayed delivery bonds when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued bonds purchased on a when issued basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trusts inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued in addition other bonds may have been purchased by the sponsor on a delayed delivery basis these bonds are expected to be delivered to the trust after the trusts first settlement date normally three business days after the trusts inception date delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them original issue discount bonds original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest understanding your investment  rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value market discount the portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were below the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds bonds selling at market discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity a market discount taxexempt bond held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable ordinary income and less in the form of taxexempt income than a comparable bond bearing interest at current market rates premium bonds the portfolio of the trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were above the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable because part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or any other amount below the trusts purchase price will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the bonds have a market value that represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value portfolio consultant the portfolio consultant may be unsuccessful in identifying bonds consistent with the trusts investment strategy the trust may not achieve its objective if this happens bond insurance bonds are not required to be covered by insurance to be included in your trust certain bonds may however be covered by insurance guaranteeing payment of interest and principal when due the premium for any bond insurance is paid by the issuer or by a prior owner of the bonds and any policy is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the bond insurer remains in business the bond insurers if any are listed in the bond names in the portfolio and a table following the portfolio bond insurance if any guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due for this purpose when due generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal and interest the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the trust units each bond insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that a bond insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made most bond insurance companies have recently had their credit ratings downgraded or placed on review for possible downgrade by recognized credit rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys investor services inc while many insurance companies have historically maintained a aaa credit rating most insurance companies are currently assigned a credit rating below this  understanding your investment level to the extent that the issuer of a bond in your trust portfolio does not independently maintain a credit rating equal to or higher than the insurer of the bond if any a downgrade in the rating of a bond insurer will result in a downgrade in the rating of the related bond this could have a material adverse effect on the value of the bonds and the value of your units how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  we created the trust under a trust agreement between advisors asset management inc as depositorsponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee to create your trust we deposited securities with the trustee or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of your trust to us each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates the number of units fractional interest of each unit in a trust estimated interest distributions per unit and estimated current and longterm returns will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment changing your portfolio your trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed your trust will generally buy and sell securities  to pay expenses  to issue additional units or redeem units  in limited circumstances to protect the trust  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust or  as permitted by the trust agreement when your trust sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered your trust will generally reject any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its portfolio if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds we may increase the size of your trust as we sell units when we create additional units we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys the securities because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses when your trust buys or sells securities we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the trust under a contract failed bonds the sponsor is authorized to purchase other bonds replacement bonds the trustee shall pay for replacement bonds out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery of such bonds to make up the original principal of the trust the replacement bonds must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and the purchase price exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the principal attributable to the failed bonds whenever a replacement bond understanding your investment  has been acquired for the trust the trustee shall within five days thereafter notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement bond and shall on the next distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond in addition a replacement bond must at the time of purchase  be a taxable municipal bond  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed bond it replaces  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity and current return of the failed bond which it replaces and  be rated at least in the category of a or the equivalent by a major rating organization if the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of the trust and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter in the event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust the estimated net annual interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long term returns might be lowered estimated current and longterm returns the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus as of the date set forth herein estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the default redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the trusts inception date this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds  understanding your investment amending the trust agreement the sponsor and the trustee can change the trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely affect your interest as determined by the sponsor and the trustee we cannot change this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this agreement termination of your trust your trust will terminate upon the maturity payment redemption sale or other liquidation of all of the securities in the portfolio the trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less than  of the original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit at this size the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust if this happens we will refund any sales charge that you paid the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining securities the trustee will send your final distribution to you within a reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting final expenses your termination distribution may be less than the price you originally paid for

between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor understanding your investment  trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into three categories ordinary income distributions capital gains dividends and return of capital ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax discussed above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year  understanding your investment and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if the trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution understanding your investment  requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in the case of dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to  distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net shortterm capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in addition distributions in respect of units after june   may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements expenses your trust will pay

information  investment objective and policies  risk factors  insurance on the bonds  administration of the trust  purchase redemption and pricing of units  taxation  performance information  description of securities ratings  general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee the sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts through its advisors asset management division when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in principal amounts which will generally maintain the same original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of the securities in such trust established by the initial deposit of the securities thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same principal amount of each security and the percentage relationship among the principal amount of each security in the related trust will generally remain the same if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under the schedule of investments in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the  securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income and to provide capital preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of longterm build america bonds there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the portfolio may also include other taxable municipal bonds but under normal circumstances the trust will invest at least  of its assets in build america bonds build america bonds are taxable debt obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states and political subdivisions and authorities thereof the american recovery and reinvestment act of  provides for municipal bond issuers to issue taxable build america bonds to finance capital expenditures for which an issuer could issue tax exempt bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment from the federal government equal to  of the amount of each interest payment on such taxable bonds the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in the special circumstances discussed herein regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities thus with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in accordance with their terms the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under normal circumstances the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market factors including advance refunding so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders the proceeds from any such sales exclusive of any portion which represents accrued interest will be credited to the principal account of such trust for distribution to the unitholders the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of securities to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust securities the trustee shall reject such offer however should any issuance exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or without an initial offer any securities or property received shall be deposited in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor advises the  trustee to keep such securities or properties the excess cash proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the principal account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract including those securities purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place after the first settlement date  accordingly the delivery of such securities may be delayed or may not occur interest on these securities begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery unitholders of all trusts will be at risk with respect to any when as and if issued or delayed delivery securities included in their respective trust ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such securities from the date they commit for units the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the purchase price of the replacement securities exclusive of accrued interest shall not exceed the principal attributable to the failed securities in addition no substitution of replacement securities will be made without an opinion of counsel that such substitution will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the related trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall within five days thereafter notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the principal and accrued interest attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such principal they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust whether or not a replacement security is acquired an amount equal to the accrued interest at the coupon rate of the failed securities will be paid to unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the failed securities from the trust if the sponsor determines not to purchase a replacement security or to the date of substitution if a replacement security is purchased all such interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor in the event a replacement security could not be acquired by a trust the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and estimated longterm return might be lowered subsequent to the trusts inception a security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trusts inception neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination to direct the trustee to dispose of such investment the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the happening of certain extraordinary circumstances certain of the securities may be subject to optional call or  mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions in each case prior to their stated maturity a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer often at a premium over par a refunding is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new bond issue a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption provisions may occur when the securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par that is when they are able to be refinanced at a lower cost the proceeds from any such call or redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions as well as proceeds from the sale of securities and from securities which mature in accordance with their terms from a trust unless utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption will be distributed to unitholders of such trust and will not be used to purchase additional securities for such trust accordingly any such call redemption sale or maturity will reduce the size and diversity of a trust and the net annual interest income of such trust and may reduce the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return the call redemption sale or maturity of securities also may have tax consequences to a unitholder certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced a discount security held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and loss in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable security newly issued at current market rates market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the securities certain of the securities in the trust may be zero coupon bonds ie an original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current interest zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of  earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors municipal bonds the trusts include certain types of bonds described below accordingly an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described in the prospectus neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue  code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from personal federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as  security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trust general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines  pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds certain of the bonds held by the trust may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds  of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease the market premium of previously issued bonds will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis see notes to portfolio in the prospectus the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery to the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of delivery unitholders who purchase their unit prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their unit for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of unit and the actual delivery of such bonds as a result of any such adjustment the estimated current returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year assuming the portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee which may be reduced in the first year only do not vary from that set forth in the prospectus unitholders will be at risk with respect to all bonds in the portfolios including when as and if issued and delayed delivery bonds ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds from the date they commit for unit certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or  refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on unit of the trust involved each trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions if any with respect to each of the debt obligations extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the trusts inception date litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is  exempt from personal federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs insurance on the bonds insurance has been obtained on certain bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds see bond insurance in the prospectus there have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc standard  poors moodys investors service inc moodys and fitch ratings ltd fitch in light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or announcements by the rating agencies you should consult announcements by the rating agencies the websites of the rating agencies and the websites of the portfolio insurers for the current publicly available information these ratings actions have had a significant impact on the portfolio insurers and other bond insurers ability to compete in the financial guarantee business a brief description of potential insurers is contained below aca financial guaranty corporation aca financial guaranty aca financial guaranty is an insurance subsidiary of aca capital holding inc organized in the state of maryland aca financial guaranty assumes credit risk through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies across all of its business lines their insured risk portfolio contains exposures of various credit qualities on december   standard  poors withdrew its ratings of aca financial guaranty at the companys request which remains in effect as of january   on december   standard  poors had raised its financial strength financial enhancement and issuer credit ratings on aca financial guaranty to b from ccc and removed the company from its creditwatch developing status the outlook was developing the upgraded rating reflected the positive effects of the restructuring transaction completed in august  that settled all outstanding collateralized debt obligations cdo and reinsurance exposures of the company including the significantly deteriorated cdo of assetbacked securities abs transactions eliminating a requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the cdo of abs counterparties the settlement required that aca financial guaranty make a  million cash payment and a distribution of surplus notes the surplus notes provided the former cdo counterparties and certain other counterparties with what amounted to a  economic interest in the company as a result of the transaction the companys  billion risk portfolio was  comprised almost exclusively of us public finance exposure predominantly of bbb and bb credit quality with aboveaverage concentrations in the health care and higher education sectors the developing outlook reflected the following possibilities that the company could run off in an orderly fashion with capital adequacy improving due to low losses and effective expense management or that capital adequacy could deteriorate through a combination of meaningful losses precipitated by weak credits andor a soft economy poor expense management andor excessive distributions to surplus noteholders as allowed by the maryland insurance administration on august   aca financial guaranty and counterparties to its structured finance products reached an agreement

negligence bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust agreement g expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon termination of the trust the fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of a trust and when owing to the trustee are secured by a lien on the trust if the balances in the interest and principal accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by the trust the trustee has the power to sell securities to pay such amounts these sales may result in capital gains or losses to unitholders a trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year  purchase redemption and pricing of units public offering price units of a trust are offered at the public offering price thereof during the initial offering period the public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset value per unit generally based on the offering side evaluations of the securities plus the applicable sales fee referred to in the prospectus the public offering price for secondary market transactions is based on the net asset value per unit generally based on the bid side evaluations of the securities certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit purchases the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on days the new york stock exchange is open and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation such public offering price will be effective for all orders received at or prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each such day orders received by the trustee sponsor or any dealer for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the public offering price per unit of the trust as shown under essential information in the prospectus as of the date stated therein or on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under essential information in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units net asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trusts portfolio securities including any accrued interest cash and other assets less all liabilities including accrued expenses by the total number of units outstanding the portfolio securities are valued at their current market value or their fair value as determined in good faith by the evaluator the aggregate bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined a on the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities b if bid or offering prices are not available for any particular security on the basis of current bid or offering prices for comparable securities c by determining the value of securities on the bid or offer side of the market by appraisal or d by any combination of the above the interest on the securities deposited in a trust less the related estimated fees and expenses will accrue daily the amount of net interest income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed exchanged or sold or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of outstanding units of a trust changes although payment is normally made three business days following the order for purchase payments may be made prior thereto a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  if a unitholder desires to have certificates representing units purchased such certificates will be delivered as soon as possible following his written request therefor  accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on securities generally is paid monthly or semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason the public offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of securities accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to the value of the units if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby comparison of public offering price and redemption price the net asset value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the current bid prices of the securities public distribution of units the sponsor intends to qualify the units for sale in a number of states units will be sold through dealers who are members of the national association of securities dealers inc and through others sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis the sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time we may provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell shares of units of this trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the our products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units  profits of sponsor the sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents in addition the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such securities to a trust which is based on the offering side evaluation of the securities the sponsor may also realize profits or losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member an underwriter or underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or competitive bid basis as principal with the motive of marketing such securities to investors at a profit the sponsor may realize additional profits or losses on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust market for units after the initial offering period while not obligated to do so the sponsor may subject to change at any time maintain a market for units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust together with any accrued interest to the expected dates of settlement unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the sponsor if the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons redemption a unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and in the case of units evidenced by a certificate by tendering such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee unitholders must sign the request and such certificate or transfer instrument exactly as their names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing the units to be redeemed if the amount of the redemption is  or less and the proceeds are payable to the unitholders of record at the address of record no signature guarantee is necessary for redemptions by individual account owners including joint owners additional documentation may be requested and a signature guarantee is always required from corporations executors administrators trustees guardians or associations the signatures must be guaranteed by a participant in the securities transfer agents medallion program stamp or such other signature guaranty program in addition to or in substitution for stamp as may be accepted by the trustee a certificate should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the unitholder since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one has been issued units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers  redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day following the day on which a tender for redemption is received the redemption date by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price determined as set forth below under computation of redemption price as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange next following such tender multiplied by the number of units being redeemed any units redeemed shall be canceled and any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished the price received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of redemption certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing interest shall be withdrawn from the interest account of a trust to the extent that funds are available for such purpose all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account for a trust the trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for the redemption of units to the extent that securities are sold the size of a trust will be and the diversity of a trust may be reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same proportional interest in each security sales may be required at a time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption the trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion if the sponsor does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption in lieu of redeeming such units to sell such units in the overthecounter market for the account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders amounts in cash net after brokerage commissions transfer taxes and other charges equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units in the event of any such sale the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of the redemption price the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed  for any period during which the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during which as determined by the securities and exchange commission trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying  securities in accordance with the trust agreement or  for such other period as the securities and exchange commission may by order permit the trustee is not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from any such suspension or postponement computation of redemption price the redemption price for units the net asset value of each trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on any other business day desired by it by a adding  the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities  the aggregate value of each issue of the securities including when issued contracts if any held in the trust as determined by the evaluator on the basis of bid prices therefor and  interest accrued and unpaid on the securities in the trust as of the date of computation b deducting therefrom  amounts representing any applicable taxes or governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the reserve account  an amount representing estimated accrued expenses of the trust including but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee including legal and auditing fees and any insurance costs the evaluator the sponsor and counsel if any  cash held for distribution to unitholders of record

prospectus contains a discussion of certain us federal income tax issues concerning your trust and the purchase ownership and disposition of trust units the discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of trust units as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state locality nonus country or other taxing jurisdiction the federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part on the advice of counsel to your trust the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust this may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law if so indicated in the prospectus your trust intends i to elect and ii to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the code and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders to qualify for the favorable us federal income tax treatment generally accorded to regulated investment companies your trust must among other things a derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of the trusts assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such  other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the trusts total assets and not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or two or more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships and c distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends interest and net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses but excludes net capital gain if any and at least  of its net taxexempt interest income each taxable year as a regulated investment company your trust generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net short term capital loss if any that it distributes to unitholders the trusts intend to distribute to its unitholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if your trust retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally your trust distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years to prevent application of the excise tax your trust intends to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement further if your trust retains any net capital gain the trust may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who if subject to federal income tax on longterm capital gains i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during january of the following calendar year these distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received if your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to satisfy the  distribution requirement in any taxable year the trust would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income even if such income were distributed to its unitholders and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income  performance information interest estimated longterm return and estimated current return as of the close of business on the business day before the trusts inception date the estimated longterm return and the estimated current return if applicable for each trust were as set forth in the essential information for each trust in the prospectus estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trustee the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of the securities while the public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the underlying securities and accrued interest therefore there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements or average life of all of the securities in a trust and  takes into account the expenses and sales fee associated with each trust unit since the market values and estimated retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price general information contained in this information supplement or in the prospectus as it currently exists or as further updated may also be included from time to time in other prospectuses or in advertising material information on the performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may be included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and may reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust the performance of a trust may also be compared to the performance of money managers

index of  stocks or similar measurement standards during the same period of time description of securities ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it  takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the issue credit rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a financial obligation inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligors or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper short term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations  likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation  nature of and provisions of the obligation  protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong  aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation bb b ccc cc and c obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bban obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ban obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cccan obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccan obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment ca subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated c is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken but payments on this obligation are being continued a c also will be assigned to a preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments but that is currently paying dan obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized  plus  or minus the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus  or minus  sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nrthis indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that

a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of aaap nri indicating that the principal portion is rated aaa and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated piratings with a pi subscript are based on an analysis of an issuers published financial information as well as additional information in the public domain they do not however reflect indepth meetings with an issuers management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than ratings without a pi subscript ratings with a pi subscript are reviewed annually based on a new years financial statements but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuers credit quality prthe letters pr indicate that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful timely completion of the project
