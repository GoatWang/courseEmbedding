announced that it was planning to sell the whole company to a privateequity firm that owns more than  other mediumsize manufacturers making everything from windshield wipers to sewing machines to coffinsfor pianists who obsess about all things steinway — is a brandnew steinway as good as one from the s and are those made in germany preferable to those made in new york — the developments had the force of a onetwo punch pianists cherish memories of the first time they set foot in the building and its famous basement where generations of professional pianists have chosen the steinways they played at concerts and recording sessionsthey also worry that new owners could meddle with steinway’s timehonored and timeconsuming manufacturing methods steinway spends almost a year building each grand piano and pianists fret that an assembly line speedup at the company’s two factories would spoil what they prize the delicacy of a steinway’s touch the colorations of its sound“there’s concern any time there’s a shift” the pianist gary graffman said “there’s no way of my knowing will they take as much care with each piano as they have in the past” photo care is taken with each instrument each grand piano takes a year to build credit bryan thomas for the new york times it is a question that has reverberated through the music world since the  million deal for the company was announced

portfolio manager whose firm has a stake in steinway has said the price is too low shares of steinway closed at  on friday  above kohlberg’s ashare offer advertisement continue reading the main story kohlberg is “not contemplating any changes to any of the manufacturing operations” said a kohlberg investment partner christopher w anderson adding that there had been no discussion of closing or moving the factories in astoria queens and hamburg germany he would not comment on whether steinway’s top management would remain after the takeover kohlberg’s chairman james a kohlberg has been a director of the new york times company since beyond the balance sheet mr anderson  has an interest in the company’s products “i grew up playing on a steinway” he said in an interview this week an upright that once belonged to his greatgrandmother and on friday he posted a letter online to steinway’s dealers in which he said one of kohlberg’s “main goals for steinway” was to “preserve and support everything that makes a steinway piano special” he also said that by going private steinway would be “free from the shortterm financial constraints of publiclytraded companies” and would have more latitude to “plan and invest with a longterm perspective”the deal would give steinway its fifth set of owners in  the steinway family — descendants of the immigrant instrument maker who started the company in  — sold it to cbs that marriage eventually soured and in the s steinway was sold to an investment group from boston steinway changed hands again in the s when it was bought by what was

down after he and john m stoner jr the president of the bandinstrument division made a bid to buy everything but the company’s piano operations steinway began a review of strategic alternatives that ended last december when it turned down the stonermessina offer and said the company was not for sale then came the overture from kohlbergunder mr messina’s replacement — michael t sweeney a former president of starbucks in britain who is chairman of the holding company for the minneapolis startribune — steinway’s financial picture brightened the company posted a profit of  million in the first quarter of  up from  in the first quarter of  piano sales rose  percent worldwideto keep pace with orders in europe and asia steinway has increased its work force by almost  percent in the last year at the hamburg plant and mr sweeney said that leaving either new york or hamburg “would be pushing the selfdestruct button for an investor”he said the building on th street was another matter he called it old and forbidding — it opened in  down the block and across the street from carnegie hall — and a financial burden steinway is shopping for space in manhattan convenient to carnegie hall and lincoln center and mr sweeney said he wanted a showroom where the pianos would look like “sculptural objects” along with a recital hall and practice roomssteinway must vacate the th street space by the end of next year and many pianists are sorry it is leaving “i’m sure i’m with everybody else on this that it’s a shame that building will no longer be steinway hall” the pianist emanuel ax said “one of the two times that i met horowitz for five seconds was when they did a celebration in that building after his  return” to performing at carnegie hall “that was very very meaningful” continue
