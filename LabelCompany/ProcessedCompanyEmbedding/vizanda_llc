oh   via united parcel service  april   charles j kubicki ownerpristine bay llc dba vianda e kemper rdcincinnati oh warning letter cindo             dear mr kubicki the us food and drug administration fda conducted inspections at your facilities located at  waycross rd cincinnati oh on august  – september   and  e kemper rd cincinnati oh on august   the inspections revealed that you have significant violations of the current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations for dietary supplements title  code of federal regulations part   cfr  these violations cause your “enzyte” “ogoplex” and “avlimil complete” dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section g of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § g in that they have been prepared packed or held under conditions that do not meet the cgmp requirements for dietary supplements you may find the act and fda regulations through links in fdas home page at wwwfdagov  your significant violations are as follows your firm failed to establish specifications for any point step or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure that the quality of the dietary supplement as required by  cfr a specifically your firm failed to establish finished product specifications for the identity purity strength and composition of your finished dietary supplements and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of your finished dietary supplements to ensure quality as required by  cfr e our inspections found that your firm has entered into agreements with other manufacturers to manufacture your dietary supplements and that your firm conducts holding and distribution operations for these products in addition your firm develops and sends product formulations describing the formula and composition for your “enzyte” “ogoplex” and “avlimil complete” dietary supplements to these manufacturers however you do not have any finished product specifications for these dietary supplements as required by  cfr  a and e   your chief operating officer told our investigator that your firm hired a pharmacologist to develop product specifications and that you will be working closely with your contract manufacturers  please note that once you establish specifications you must make and keep records of established specifications  cfr b furthermore your firm was cited for not establishing product specifications during a previous inspection conducted on july    your firm failed to implement quality control operations to ensure the quality of your dietary supplements as required by  cfr  your firm does not perform any quality control operations nor does it have designated quality control personnel to perform the quality control operations required under  cfr part  subpart f you firm also failed to identify a person who is currently responsible for your quality control operations as required by  cfr b in addition your firm failed to establish written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision as required by  cfr  and  cfr b while you provided some written procedures for quality control operations your warehouse manager stated that your firm has not been following such procedures since your quality control manager left your firm in july  further these written procedures do not include procedures for quality control personnel conducting a material review and making a disposition decision your firm’s quality control personnel must approve for release or reject any packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution as required by  cfr h  as a distributor that contracts with other manufacturers to manufacture package or label dietary supplements that your firm releases for distribution under your firm’s name your firm has an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution  fed reg   jun   your firm introduces or delivers or causes the introduction or delivery of dietary supplement products into interstate commerce in their final form for distribution to consumers as such your firm has an overarching and ultimate responsibility to ensure that all phases of the production of that product are in compliance with dietary supplement cgmp requirements although your firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations it cannot by the same token contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplements it places into commerce or causes to be placed into commerce are not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements  see united states v dotterweich  us    explaining that an offense can be committed under the act by anyone who has a “responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws” united states v park  us    holding that criminal liability under the act does not turn on awareness of wrongdoing and that “agents vested with the responsibility and power commensurate with that responsibility to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the act” can be held accountable for violations of the act in particular the act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction or causing the delivery or introduction into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section g for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements see  usc §§ g a thus a firm that contracts with other firms to conduct certain dietary supplement manufacturing packaging and labeling operations for it is responsible for ensuring that the dietary supplement is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements regardless of who actually performs the dietary supplement cgmp operations your firm must establish a system of production and process controls and implement quality control operations to ensure the quality of your dietary supplements and that the dietary supplements are packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record  cfr  and  you firm must establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations  cfr  the quality control personnel must ensure that your manufacturing packaging labeling and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record  cfr  further you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval of release for any packaged and labeled dietary supplement  cfr h and b however you do not conduct quality control review to ensure the quality of the dietary supplements that you distribute and that they are packaged and labeled according to the master manufacturing record       in addition your firm was cited for not implementing quality control operations during a previous inspection conducted on july         your firm failed to follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations as required by  cfr  you must hold dietary supplements under appropriate conditions of temperature humidity and light so that the identity purity strength and composition of the dietary supplements are not affected as required by  cfr a while your written procedures for holding and distribution operations provide that your firm will hold finished product in a storage area under appropriate conditions your firm was not able to show that such  procedures were being followed such as by providing documents eg inspection logs or other information in fact your warehouse manager who is responsible for warehouse procedures and responsibilities stated that she was not aware of the procedures       your quality control personnel failed to review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint as required by  cfr b specifically on september   a customer called and reported that your product “enzyte” had caused a heart attack and made kidneys retain fluid  this complaint was not reviewed by quality control personnel and was not investigated for further followup action   furthermore you failed to keep written records of every product complaint that is related to good manufacturing practice as required by  cfr b specifically all complaints from july   to august   were requested for review during our inspection  however your firm could only find complaint records taken by one employee from july   to september         your firm failed to report a serious adverse event report saer for a dietary supplement within the statutory  business days as required under section  of the act  usc aa specifically as described above your firm received a complaint on september   for your “enzyte” product from a customer asserting that the dietary supplement had caused the customer to have a heart attack and make the customer’s kidneys retain fluid however your firm failed to submit a saer to fda for this adverse event as required by section  of the act under section c of the act you must submit a report of a serious adverse event associated with any of your dietary supplements to fda no later fifteen  business days after a report of the event is received through the address or phone number provided on your dietary supplement products because prompt submission of such serious adverse event reports is important for public health reasons the agency recommends that all serious adverse events be reported to fda within  business days of receipt regardless of the means by which you receive the initial report these serious adverse event reports must be submitted under the medwatch form a more information on adverse event reporting can be found online in the publication “questions and answers regarding adverse event reporting and recordkeeping for dietary supplements as required by the dietary supplement and nonprescription drug consumer protection act” available on our website at wwwfdagov    we reviewed your response letter dated october   which explains that many of your stated corrections include drafting and updating sops and training your employees  however your response is not adequate because the revised sops and details about the training were not provided for our review to determine if your corrections will ensure that your dietary supplements are manufactured packaged labeled and held according to current good manufacturing practices further our inspections determined that your employees have not followed your current sops in fact your chief operating officer in charge of daily operations stated that your firm’s good manufacturing practices procedures have not been followed since july  this letter is not an allinclusive list of the violations at your facility you are responsible for ensuring that your firm complies with the act and its implementing regulations including the dietary supplement cgmp regulations  cfr part  you should take prompt action to correct these violations failure to promptly correct these violations may result in enforcement action without further notice such as seizure andor injunction section  of the act  usc § j authorizes fda to assess and collect fees to cover fda’s costs for certain activities including reinspectionrelated costs  a reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to the food safety requirements of the act specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved  reinspectionrelated costs means  all expenses including administrative expenses incurred in connection with fda’s arranging conducting and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees  usc jab for a domestic facility fda will assess and collect fees for reinspectionrelated costs from the responsibility party for the domestic facility the inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materiality related to a food safety requirement of the act accordingly fda may assess fees to cover any reinspectionrelated costs you should respond in writing within fifteen  working days from your receipt of this letter your reply should include the specific steps that you are taking correct these violations if you cannot complete all corrections before you respond you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations your response should be sent to us food and drug administration  steger dr cincinnati oh  attention karen gale sego compliance officer if you have questions
