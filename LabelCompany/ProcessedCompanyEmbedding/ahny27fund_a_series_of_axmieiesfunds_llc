of current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of investmentgrade fixedincome securities with a weighted average effective maturity and effective duration of less than three years monthly income an actively managed shortterm bond strategy for investors seeking monthly income limited interest rate risk and total return opportunities quality   income   potentially limited interest rate risk designed for riskconscious investors the investment grade bond portfolio is composed of short term high quality government corporate and structured securities   the fund complements its core high quality bonds with measured exposure to high yield bonds which may provide opportunities for higher risk adjusted returns and incremental yield   the short term portfolio targets to keep the average effective maturity and effective duration a measure of sensitivity to interest rate risk less than three years which may limit investor exposure to changing interest rates footnotes  the average effective maturity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds taking into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer effective duration is a measure as estimated by the fund’s portfolio managers of a bond funds price sensitivity to changes in interest rates it takes into account mortgage prepayments puts adjustable coupons and potential call dates the longer a fund’s duration the more sensitive the fund is to shifts in interest rates as of  morningstar rating™ overall rating

due to rounding holdings are subject to change and are not buysell recommendations fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet  about risk active trading risk active trading of portfolio securities may result in high brokerage costs which may lower the funds actual return active trading also may increase the proportion of the funds gains that are short term which are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may persist in the future potentially leading to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline in addition because of changing central bank policies the fund may experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs and potentially lower the funds performance returns collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner if an issuer seeks to restructure the terms of its borrowings or the fund is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal the fund may incur additional expenses changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk a derivative is an instrument whose value depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks which are described below counterparty risk certain derivatives do not trade on an established exchange referred to as overthecounter otc derivatives and are simply financial contracts between the fund and a counterparty when the fund is owed money on an otc derivative the fund is dependent on the counterparty to pay or in some cases deliver the underlying asset unless the fund can otherwise sell its derivative contract to a third party prior to its expiration many counterparties are financial institutions such as banks and brokerdealers and their creditworthiness and ability to pay or perform may be negatively impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally in addition in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or insolvent the funds ability to recover the collateral that the fund has on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired for derivatives traded on a centralized exchange the fund generally is dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such derivatives for payment on derivative instruments for which the fund is owed money leverage risk many derivatives do not require a payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative which creates a form of leverage as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative leverage may therefore make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss the fund segregates or earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that the fund owes the derivative counterparty each day if any or otherwise holds instruments that offset the funds daily obligation under the derivatives instrument this process is sometimes referred to as cover the amount of liquid assets needed as cover will fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and falls if the value of the funds derivative positions or the value of the assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases the fund may be forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or to meet redemption requests which could affect management of the fund and the funds returns in certain market conditions losses on derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the funds other assets fall resulting in the funds derivative positions becoming a larger percentage of the funds investments liquidity risk there is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain derivatives particularly otc derivatives than more traditional investments such as stocks these buyers and sellers are often financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell derivatives during times of financial or market stress derivative instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions to the extent that the fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market illiquidity the fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the fund and its ability to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a substantial portion of the funds otherwise liquid assets must be used as margin or cover another consequence of illiquidity is that the fund may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take or make delivery of the underlying asset that the adviser would otherwise have attempted to avoid other risks compared to other types of investments derivatives may be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient as described under the taxes section of the prospectus in addition changes in government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the character timing and amount of the funds taxable income or gains and may limit or prevent the fund from using certain types of derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy which could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or require the fund to change its investment strategy to the extent that the fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment there may be imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or market segment in which case the fund may not realize the intended benefits there is also the risk that during adverse market conditions an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no hedging benefits at all the funds use of derivatives may be limited by the requirements for taxation of the fund as a regulated investment company emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law in many emerging market countries is relatively new and unsettled therefore laws regarding foreign investment in emerging market securities securities regulation title to securities and shareholder rights may change quickly and unpredictably in addition the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal regional and local levels in emerging market countries may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change other risks of investing in emerging markets securities may include additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign credit exposure risk us dollardenominated securities carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of principal and interest foreign government debt risk investments in foreign government debt securities sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities involve certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt securities generally the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt and the fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the defaulting government a foreign government debtors willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign currency reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange the relative size of the debt burden the foreign government debtors policy toward its principal international lenders and local political constraints certain issuers of foreign government debt may be dependent on disbursements from foreign governments multinational agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt without the approval of debt holders some governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments foreign securities risk the value of the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability in the home countries of the issuers of the investments by changes in economic or taxation policies in those countries or by the difficulty in enforcing obligations in those countries foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls foreign companies generally may be subject to less stringent regulations than us companies including financial reporting requirements and auditing and accounting controls and may therefore be more susceptible to fraud or corruption also there may be less publicly available information about companies in certain foreign countries than about us companies making it more difficult for the adviser to evaluate those companies the laws of certain countries may put limits on the funds ability to recover its assets held at a foreign bank if the foreign bank depository or issuer of a security or any of their agents goes bankrupt trading in many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than us securities due to the size of the market or other factors unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk the funds investments in high yield debt securities commonly referred to as junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse economic regulatory political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile these securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be difficult to sell at a desirable time or price particularly in times of negative sentiment toward high yield securities liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments an investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading certain restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation difficulties liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect there can be no guarantee that the advisers investment techniques or investment decisions will produce the desired results additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available to the investment manager in connection with managing the fund which may also adversely affect the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole the value of the funds investments may go up or down due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for revenues or corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates regional or global instability or adverse investor sentiment generally the value of the funds investments may also go up or down due to factors that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector such as changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities including collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity mortgage and assetbacked securities are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling as a result the fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income mortgage and assetbacked securities also are subject to extension risk an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments and extend the life of the mortgage and assetbacked securities causing the price of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and the funds share price to fall and would make the mortgage and assetbacked securities more sensitive to interest rate changes an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and will result in losses to the fund the fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages privately issued mortgagerelated securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those mortgagerelated securities that have government or governmentsponsored entity guarantees as a result the mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgagerelated securities may and frequently do have less favorable collateral credit risk or other underwriting characteristics than government or governmentsponsored mortgagerelated securities and have wider variances in a number of terms including interest rate term size purpose and borrower characteristics municipal securities risk the risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer constitutional amendments legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations voter initiatives and the issuers regional economic conditions may affect the municipal securitys value interest payments repayment of principal and the funds ability to sell the security municipal obligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar periods of economic stress municipal securities structured as revenue bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for which the bonds were issued if the internal revenue service determines that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements interest from the security could be treated as taxable which could result in a decline in the securitys value in addition there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities tba transactions risk tba transactions involve the risk that the securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the fund when entering into the tba transaction tba transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty will fail to deliver the securities exposing the fund to further losses whether or not the fund takes delivery of the securities at the termination date of a tba transaction the fund will nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying investments during the term of the agreement if the fund sells short tba mortgages that it does not own and the mortgages increase in value the fund may be required to pay a higher price than anticipated to purchase the deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale and thereby incur a loss a short position in tba mortgages poses more risk than holding the same tba mortgages long it is possible that the market value of the mortgage securities the fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that the market value of the mortgage securities the fund has sold short increases thereby magnifying any losses the more the fund pays to purchase the mortgage securities sold short the more it will lose on the transaction which adversely affects its share price the loss on a long position is limited to what the fund originally paid for the tba mortgage together with any transaction costs in short transactions there is no limit on how much the price of a security can increase thus the funds exposure is theoretically unlimited the fund normally closes a short sale of tba mortgages that it does not own by purchasing mortgage securities on the open market and delivering them to the broker the fund may not always be able to complete or close out the short position by purchasing mortgage securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund incurs a loss if the fund is required to buy the deliverable mortgage securities at a time when they have appreciated in value from the date of the short sale the fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling tba mortgages short in addition taking short positions results in a form of leverage as a result changes in the value of a funds investments will have a larger effect on its share price than if it did not engage in these transactions us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery occurs in addition the fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be advantageous these transactions have a leveraging effect on the fund because the fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date these investments therefore increase the funds overall investment exposure and as a result its volatility typically no income accrues on securities the fund has committed to purchase prior to the time delivery of the securities is made although the fund may earn income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions zero coupon or payinkind securities risk zero coupon and payinkind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods prices on noncashpaying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the issuers financial condition fluctuation in interest rates and market demandsupply imbalances than cashpaying securities with similar credit ratings and thus may be more speculative investors may purchase zero coupon and payinkind securities at a price below the amount payable at maturity because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic payments of interest prior to maturity this prevents any reinvestment of interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise the higher yields and interest rates on payinkind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans payinkind securities may have a potential variability in valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain lowergrade securities such as zero coupon or payinkind securities as of  stbax nav change    nas may

section  of erisa section  names three classes of persons who may commence an action for breach of a fiduciary duty  a participant or beneficiary  the secretary of labor and  a fiduciary  usc § a see mccabe v trombley  f supp   n ndny  “section  is the provision which defines the scope of the court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the instant suit in which plaintiff alleges a breach of fiduciary duty” plaintiff brings this cause of action as a former trustee of the mtdctf as well as a plan participant as a former trustee plaintiff lacks standing to allege a breach of fiduciary duties in chemung canal trust co v sovran bankmd  fd  d cir  the second circuit long ago held that a former fiduciary lacks standing to claim a breach of erisa’s fiduciary duties id at  the second circuit considered the list of people that section  allows to sue  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  and concluded that “the statute names only three classes of persons who may commence an action and a former fiduciary is not one of them” id the second circuit went on to explain that the list in section  was “exclusive” and that the statute’s legislative history indicated no intent to “grant a former fiduciary a continuing right to sue on behalf of the plan    ” id accordingly plaintiff lacks standing to sue as a former trustee plaintiff also claims standing as a plan participant standing requirements for a plan participant differ depending on kind of relief requested by plaintiff while “a plan participant may have article iii standing to obtain injunctive relief related to erisa’s disclosure and fiduciary duty requirements without a showing of individual harm to the participant” plaintiff must have “suffered an injuryinfact” to claim restitution or disgorgement cent states se

fiduciary duty first plaintiff claims that proskauer expended plan assets starting in february  to prove plaintiff was guilty of criminal charges psac ¶  and second that proskauer virga o’brien and

page  of  plaintiff access to fund records and to preclude him from attending trust fund and executive board meetings id ¶  the court will assume that plaintiff has adequate participant standing for these two allegations because of these specific claims in the psac that plaintiff was personally injured standing however does not end the matter fund defendants argue that even if plaintiff has standing he has not pled a breach of any duty because no interest of his in the fund has been denied or taken away the court agrees an employer’s investigation of allegation of sexual harassment “is not a gratuitous or optional undertaking under federal law an employer’s failure to investigate may allow a jury to impose liability on the employer” see malik v carrier corp  fd   d cir  thus fund defendants had “an affirmative duty to investigate the report of an allegation of sexual harassment” id at  furthermore proskauer cannot be sued for a breach of fiduciary duties in investigating singh’s allegations because inter alia its services were authorized by the trustees and do not “amount to illegal profits or ill gotten gains derived directly from defendants’ alleged culpable acts” see savasta  wl  at  holding that fees paid to a nonfiduciary pursuant to a service agreement with a union fund are not actionable as disgorgement under section  of erisa although section  of erisa

more than his disagreement with proskauer’s role and some of their fees plaintiff’s second allegation of breach is also unfounded fund defendants’ decision to preclude plaintiff from attending a meeting of the trustees and accessing fund records even if  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  true does not state a breach of fiduciary duty recognized by statute any plan or the common law plaintiff’s allegations do not state a claim in large part because they are far afield from erisa’s purpose as well as the statutory rights and rights at commonlaw that erisa seeks to protect see  usc §§bc  a see also massachusetts v morash  us    “erisa was passed by congress in  to safeguard employees from the abuse and mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance various types of

a federal job protection scheme” quoting raymond v mobil oil corp  fd   th cir  alteration in original nothing about precluding plaintiff from meetings about his alleged sexual assault even if that assault never occurred remotely threatens the management of plaintiff’s benefits proskauer also argues that plaintiff has not sufficiently pled that proskauer is a fiduciary under  usc §  the statute

any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation direct or indirect with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan or has any authority or responsibility to do so or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan  usca § a “this

fischer no  civ   wl  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of   at  sdny mar   courts have construed broadly the definition of “fiduciary” contained in erisa see mertens v hewitt assocs  us    “whether or not an individual or entity is an erisa fiduciary must be determined by focusing on the function performed rather than on the title held” blatt v marshall  lassman  fd   d cir  holding that defendants were fiduciaries because they exercised actual control over plan assets relying on the department of labor’s regulations promulgated under erisa the second circuit has explained that an attorney accountant actuary or consultant who renders legal accounting actuarial or consulting services to an employee benefit plan    is not a fiduciary to the plan solely by virtue of the rendering of such services absent a showing that such consultant a exercises discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting the management of the plan b exercises authority or control respecting management or disposition of the plan’s assets c renders investment advice for a fee direct or indirect with respect to the assets of the plan or has any authority or responsibility to do so or d has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan fh krear  co v nineteen named trustees  fd   d cir  quoting  cfr §   plaintiff’s conclusory allegations merely portray proskauer as a zealous advocate for the fund and plaintiff’s personal opposition to proskauer’s role or billing practices fails to make proskauer a fiduciary the allegations in the psac fall far short of claiming that proskauer had discretionary authority or control over the fund that proskauer managed fund assets rendered investment advice or had discretionary authority or responsibility over the administration of the fund while plaintiff also makes many conclusory allegations about proskauer’s handson involvement with the fund nothing in the psac is sufficient to allege that proskauer crossed the  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  threshold from legal counsel to that of a fund fiduciary see acosta v pace local i health fund no  civ   wl  at  d nj feb   holding that conclusory claims that lawyer acted as fiduciary for erisa purposes did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted instead plaintiff’s allegations merely demonstrate that proskauer’s services were typical of those provided by legal counsel rather than those of a fiduciary see eg health cost controls of illinois inc v washington  fd   th cir  “lawyers and other professionals who render services to the plan’s administrator do not exercise any decisionmaking authority over the plan or plan assets the power to act for the plan is essential to status as a

accordingly proskauer cannot be sued as an erisa fiduciary and plaintiff’s claim in this regard fails fund defendants also contend that several of plaintiff’s allegations are barred by erisa’s statute of limitations erisa requires that an action for breach of fiduciary duty be brought  six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation or b in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation or  three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation except that in the case of fraud or concealment such action may be commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of such breach or violation  usc §  fund defendants argue that plaintiff’s position as a trustee gave plaintiff actual knowledge of many of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty brought in this case plaintiff became a trustee of the mtdc in august  see ello  wl  at  and remained a trustee until his resignation on april   which plaintiff characterizes as a constructive discharge psac ¶¶  it is not clear however whether the threeyear limitation or the sixyear limitation applies in this case or if some combination of the three and sixyear limitations apply to different claims the threeyear limitation applies “three years after the earliest date on

misrepresentation or omission of a material fact to induce an employeebeneficiary to act to his detriment or  engaged in acts to hinder the discovery of a breach of fiduciary duty” id at  at this stage of the case defendants have opposed plaintiff’s motion to file a proposed second amended complaint on futility grounds defendants argue that the psac fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted much of what fund defendants ask the court to decide on the statue of limitations defense cannot be decided on a rule b motion because the court must limit its review to the psac documents attached to the psac and documents incorporated into the psac by reference see newman  fd at  “dismissal for failure to state a claim based on a statute of limitations is appropriate only if a

to fill the void left by the psac virga’s affidavit however does not fit within the three categories of materials that this court can consider when defendants merely contest the sufficiency of the pleadings as they  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  have done here therefore the court will not consider virga’s affidavit to decide the statute of limitations defense one of plaintiff’s claims is susceptible to adjudication on the pleadings plaintiff claims that the trustees’ decision to retain carlos mellace who retired in december  was a breach of fiduciary duty psac ¶¶  under the more lenient sixyear statute of limitations plaintiff’s last opportunity to bring a claim for this alleged breach was december  plaintiff’s first complaint in this case was filed on november   which is beyond the six year limitation period this claim is barred under the statute of limitations and therefore is futile fund defendants are correct to note however that the existence of these documents may be relevant to the good faith and due diligence of plaintiff and his counsel in making the allegations in the psac because plaintiff himself was a trustee starting in  he also had actual knowledge of this alleged breach well before the threeyear statute of limitations ran counsel for liuna and pocino urge the court to hold that plaintiff violated fed r civ p  by failing to make a demand on the

participant under section a is not controlled by diduck plaintiff as a participant need not comply with rule  because he may not proceed under section g and diduck is only controlling as to the latter fund defendants argue that plaintiff’s claims are barred by the doctrines of unclean hands in pari delicto and acquiescence because plaintiff served as a trustee when many of the events in the psac took place the court cannot decide this issue without considering the affidavit of john j virga for reasons explained above virga’s affidavit does not fit within the three categories of materials that

giardina and at least four others were improperly receiving benefits psac ¶¶  following up on this supposed complaint plaintiff alleges that he sought a meeting with a variety of liuna officials including the inspector general in late november  id ¶¶  plaintiff later objected to a recommendation to merely terminate the improper benefits because plaintiff thought that an audit was necessary to determine if others were improperly receiving benefits id ¶¶  soon thereafter virga allegedly expressed his “displeasure” that plaintiff had referred to the matter to liuna id ¶  according to plaintiff it was soon after this series of events that plaintiff was asked by pocino in midmarch  to resign from his liuna and gynlecet positions and it is to those positions and not to any positions

in part motivated by the specific intent to engage in activity prohibited by § ’” tavolini  f supp d at  quoting dister  fd at  according to union defendants plaintiff has failed to satisfy this element because he only has alleged that he was deprived of his rights as a trustee of the fund and because any actions by pocino were in not in his union capacity relatedly union defendants argue that plaintiff’s alleged whistleblower activities related only to the operation of the fund and not to the operation of liuna these arguments while potentially dispositive at the summary judgment stage fail to demonstrate that plaintiff’s proposed amendment is futile while some of plaintiff’s allegations involve limits on his role as a trustee of the fund and by themselves do not make out a section  claim the core of his claim is that he lost his job at liuna because of his complaints regarding fraudulent administration of the fund and while the psac is a little vague about which capacity pocino was acting when he sought plaintiff’s resignation it cannot be said that plaintiff’s allegations regarding pocino’s motives or what hat he was wearing bar the claim thus given the  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  plausibility of plaintiff’s claims regarding pocino’s conduct and in particular the motives for that conduct the scope of plaintiff’s whistleblower activities is best left for either summary judgment or a trial defendant’s second point asks whether plaintiff’s whistleblowing activities involved an “inquiry” for purposes of section  here plaintiff is helped by the second circuit’s decision in nicolaou v horizon media  fd   d cir  in which the court held that “the proper focus is not on the formality or informality of the circumstances under which an individual gives information but rather on whether the circumstances can fairly be deemed to constitute an ‘inquiry’” and thus be entitled to protection under section  plaintiff adequately alleges though just barely that he sought meetings with several individuals including the liuna inspector general to provide information about suspected fraud in benefits disbursement while plaintiff does not allege he was responding to or providing information to a formal inquiry plaintiff’s claims regarding his alleged efforts at scheduling a meeting with decisionmakers and those who might begin a formal inquiry could constitute a section  claim id noting that allegations that plaintiff met with outside counsel and the employer’s president sufficient to state a claim under section  thus plaintiff’s proposed amendment to his second cause of action against union defendants may proceed but his allegations regarding proskauer and fund defendants may not c civil rico plaintiff alleges that proskauer

contends that this illegal activity has injured him in two ways first he argues that he is liable for the losses of the mtdctf as a result of the illegal activity id ¶  and second he claims that his property interest in the pension plan and welfare fund has been harmed because “every dollar of loss is a dollar that is unavailable to pay benefits to plaintiff and his dependents” id ¶  the elements

does not allege any racketeering activity and that plaintiff has failed to plead operation and control of the alleged enterprise indeed there are more holes in plaintiff’s rico cause of action than in the proverbial piece of swiss cheese however because the court agrees with defendants that plaintiff lacks standing under rico to bring this claim the court need not reach these other deficiencies civil rico allows “any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section ” to sue for treble damages and attorneys’ fees  usc § c “from this language courts have extracted

for defamation against rossein proskauer pocino singh and columbia spsac ¶  plaintiff claims that these defendants defamed him by making false statements in connection with the investigation of singh’s allegations of sexual assault against plaintiff to state a claim for defamation under new york law plaintiff must establish “ that a defamatory statement of fact was made concerning plaintiff  that the defendant published that statement to a third party  that the statement was false  that there exists some degree of fault  and that there are special damages or that the statement is defamatory per se ie it disparaged the plaintiff in the way of his or her office profession or trade” muzio v inc village of bayville no  civ   wl  at  edny jan   the court will consider the alleged

 the court will consider the alleged defamatory statements made by each defendant  rossein merrick rossein was retained by proskauer on behalf of the funds to investigate singh’s allegations against plaintiff and to issue a report detailing his findings “rossein report” or “report” plaintiff claims that the rossein report is libelous but doesn’t identify any particular portion of the report as containing the libelous material the court will liberally construe plaintiff’s claim to encompass the entire report fund defendants argue that the contents of the rossein report are protected by a qualified privilege under new york law a “conditional or qualified privilege extends to a ‘communication made by one person to another upon a subject in which both have an interest’” liberman v gelstein  ned   ny  quoting stillman v ford  nyd    in the employment context the qualified privilege is recognized as protecting the although the entire report is not reproduced in the spsac it is both referred to in the spsac and integral to the psac so the court will consider the contents of the report see chambers v time warner inc  fd   d cir  “even where a document is not incorporated by

commonlaw or constitutional variety” id see also liberman  ned at  explaining that a finding of either form of malice defeats the privilege “commonlaw malice is based on the traditional concept of spite or ill will while constitutional malice or ‘actual’ malice refers to publication of false material with knowledge of its falsity or a high degree of awareness of the falsity” dunson  f supp d at  plaintiff must show malice based on a preponderance of the evidence see id plaintiff has failed to adequately plead that rossein’s report satisfies either commonlaw malice or actual malice to establish commonlaw malice plaintiff must show that rossein’s ill will towards plaintiff was “the one and only cause for the publication    ” loksen  fd at  internal quotations and citation omitted thus for plaintiff to show commonlaw malice he must show that rossein issued the report solely to harm plaintiff the spsac does not make that allegation as an initial matter rossein was retained as an outsider to conduct an investigation into singh’s allegations against plaintiff spsac ¶  when rossein was retained he was a stranger with no motive to harm plaintiff and plaintiff has not pled that rossein subsequently developed any animus towards plaintiff see brattis v rainbow adver holdings llc no  civ   wl  at  sdny may   stating that a finding of personal animus is necessary to establish commonlaw malice plaintiff contends that rossein’s report was onesided even though the spsac documents rossein’s  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  attempt to interview plaintiff before he issued his report spsac ¶  according to the spsac after rossein spoke to plaintiff’s counsel rossein agreed to meet with plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel on april   id ¶¶  plaintiff acknowledges however that it was plaintiff’s counsel who advised plaintiff to refuse to meet with rossein on the day of their scheduled meeting id ¶  based solely on the facts pled in the spsac it is apparent that rossein omitted plaintiff’s version of the events from the report because plaintiff upon advice of counsel refused to meet with rossein id notwithstanding these facts plaintiff remarkably claims that rossein’s report is defamatory because it fails to take plaintiff’s side of the story into account spsac ¶¶  the merits of the rossein report however are not at issue the question rather is whether rossein issued his report strictly out of illwill towards plaintiff nothing in the spsac even suggests an affirmative answer to that question if anything the spsac supports the opposite inference the same conclusion follows under the actual malice standard which asks whether rossein knew that the defamatory statements in his report were false or had a high degree of awareness that they were false again plaintiff’s refusal to meet with rossein made it impossible for rossein to credit plaintiff’s version of singh’s allegations spsac ¶  moreover plaintiff cannot claim actual malice under these circumstances because “it is well settled that a defendant’s failure to investigate before making defamatory statements does not support a finding of actual malice” boyd v nationwide mut ins co  fd   d cir  citing hartehanks communications inc v connaughton  us    case cvrjs document  filed  page  of   accord brattis  wl  at  in any event rossein’s report is certainly more thorough than other employergenerated investigative reports that have enjoyed the employer’s qualified privilege see dunson  f supp d at  questioning the accuracy or conclusions drawn in a report not enough to defeat privilege in addition plaintiff also fails to plead that rossein knew the conclusions in his report were false or that he was aware of a likelihood of falsity  proskauer proskauer is alleged to have defamed plaintiff three times spsac ¶¶  first plaintiff alleges that detective whelan “told plaintiff that kathleen mckenna a partner at proskauer telephoned him repeatedly regarding the charges and made statements evidencing her belief in plaintiff’s guilt” in connection with the singh episode spsac ¶  second plaintiff claims that mckenna defamed plaintiff in a letter setting out the rossein report’s findings which was sent to plaintiff’s counsel on june   id ¶  third plaintiff claims that a letter sent to assistant district attorney willa concannon which included a copy of the rossein report in response to a subpoena contained defamatory statements id ¶  the court does not mean to suggest that rossein failed to investigate plaintiff’s side of the story but even if platiniff’s allegations could be construed to suggest such a claim they would be futile as a matter of law based on plaintiff’s own allegations  even more generically plaintiff alleges that mckenna “has knowingly submitted false and defamatory information to law enforcement and judicial authorities” how ms mckenna could possibly defend against such an amorphous allegation is a mystery and therefore it does not even come close to stating a claim see reilly v natwest markets group inc  fd   d cir  affirming dismissal of plaintiff’s bare claim that defendant “said ‘something bad’ about him to client”  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  the first claim is deficient for it utterly fails to identify what mckenna is alleged to have said to detective whelan let alone even estimate when she is alleged to have made any particular statements to the detective instead the only allegation is that detective whelan supposedly told plaintiff that mckenna made statements “evidencing her belief in plaintiff’s guilt” in connection with the singh episode yet there is not a single reference to what mckenna actually said indeed it is entirely unclear if detective whelan interpreted whatever mckenna said properly or if he based his conclusion about mckenna’s belief in plaintiff’s guilt from something other than mckenna’s actual words such as her tone of voice and because plaintiff has not provided any information regarding when detective whelan and mckenna had these conversations the court concludes that this claim of defamation fails to state a claim and therefore is futile see scholastic  f supp

second claim plaintiff makes relates to a june   letter mckenna sent to counsel for plaintiff according to plaintiff this letter was written in response to a letter sent by plaintiff’s counsel accusing the union and fund defendants and proskauer of violating plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights plaintiff’s claim regarding the june   letter fails however because he does not allege that the contents of the letter are false let alone how they are otherwise defamatory “a plaintiff in a libel action must identify a plausible defamatory  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  meaning of the challenged statement or publication” celle v filipino reporter enterps inc  fd   d cir  “whether a statement is susceptible of a defamatory meaning is a threshold question of law to be resolved by the court if the statement complained of is susceptible of more than one meaning at least one of which is defamatory the claim must go to the jury” netzer v continuity graphic assocs inc  f supp   sdny  under new york law a statement will be found defamatory only if it “tends to expose one to public hatred shame obloquy contumely odium contempt ridicule aversion ostracism degradation or disgrace or to induce an evil opinion of one in the minds of rightthinking persons and to deprive one of their confidence and friendly intercourse in society” fairley v peekskill star corp  nysd   app div  the blockquoted portions of the june   letter in the psac say nothing defamatory about plaintiff in essence this letter states i that proskauer represents the funds ii that plaintiff’s counsel’s letter contains inaccuracies regarding plaintiff’s departure from the union iii that plaintiff’s cooperation with the investigation by mr rossein might have better informed counsel about the facts and circumstances of the investigation while detailing rossein’s unsuccessful efforts to interview plaintiff and iv that mckenna believes that the funds committed no violation of plaintiff’s statutory or common law rights in short plaintiff identifies nothing about the contents of this letter that defames him even if the contents of the letter were untrue and even if mckenna knew them to be untrue nor does plaintiff’s conclusory allegations that mckenna or proskauer intended to defame plaintiff save this particular allegation see scholastic  f supp d at  noting insufficiency of  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  conclusory allegation that plaintiff was defamed by false statements thus it would be futile for plaintiff to proceed on this claim finally there is nothing actionable about proskauer’s production of the rossein report to the assistant district attorney as that production was absolutely privileged according to the second circuit “vintage case law demonstrates that new york bestows an absolute privilege upon those whom the government compels to give evidence” boice v unisys corp  fd   d cir  this absolute privilege attaches when “ the disclosure was compelled by subpoena  the disclosure materially responded to the subpoena and  the person did not set the investigation in motion or otherwise manipulate the investigative process to promote the libel” boice  fd at  the first factor–that the disclosure was compelled by a subpoena–is conceded by plaintiff when he quotes mckenna’s letter to the assistant district attorney in the spsac without disputing mckenna’s claim that she was producing the report in response to a subpoena spsac ¶  nor does plaintiff claim that the production of the report exceeded the scope of the subpoena leaving only the third factor to consider the psac is not clear however on the third factor plaintiff claims that mckenna informed the district attorney’s office after april   though the date is not specified that rossein had prepared a report on singh’s sexual assault claim id ¶  the spsac does not allege however that mckenna set the investigation in motion or that she manipulated the police investigation in fact the spsac acknowledges that the investigation was initiated by singh in february  and that a detective was assigned to investigate singh’s allegations id ¶  accordingly by plaintiff’s own pleadings it is clear that law enforcement officials learned about singh’s allegations from singh and initiated the investigation on their own thus mckenna’s  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  production of the rossein report and her provision of other information to the district attorney’s office was absolutely privileged thus making plaintiff’s allegation on this point futile  pocino pocino is alleged to have defamed plaintiff by “doing proskauer’s bidding and ostracizing him” and by “treating plaintiff as if though he was guilty” which created the “false impression that plaintiff was in fact guilty” spsac ¶¶  pocino also is alleged to have provided rossein false and misleading information id ¶  the court will consider the first group of allegations as claiming defamation by implication since plaintiff has not pled that pocino said anything defamatory with the exception of his statements to rossein “defamation by implication involves ‘false suggestions impressions and implications arising from otherwise truthful statements”’ levin v mcphee  fd   n d cir  quoting armstrong v simon  schuster inc  ned   ny  neither the new york courts nor the second circuit has specifically identified the pleading elements of defamation by implication see levin  fd at  n see also roberti v schroder inv mgmt n am inc no  civ   wl  at  sdny mar   the court has found no case law however suggesting that a claim for defamation by implication relieves plaintiff of identifying the allegedly defamatory words that were uttered and to whom they were directed plaintiff’s claim that pocino did proksauer’s bidding treated him as though plaintiff was guilty and created the impression he was guilty are futile because plaintiff has not identified a statement or writing from which the alleged defamation arose in armstrong the new york court of appeals described memphis publ co v nichols  swd  tenn  as  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  “illustrative” of defamation by implication in nichols the alleged defamation was a newspaper article although the plaintiff in nichols was suing based on a defamatory implication arising from the article the court finds it instructive that the implication arose from a finite collection of identifiable words reproduced in print thus the court reads armstrong to require plaintiff to identify the exact words that plaintiff believes were uttered in order to adequately support a claim of defamation by implication furthermore in cases alleging defamation by implication “plaintiffs typically have to show that defendants affirmatively intended such implication” vinas v chubb corp  fsupp d   sdny  the spsac does not sufficiently plead that pocino intended to impugn plaintiff plaintiff pleads that pocino made false statements willfully and maliciously but he offers nothing more than this conclusory statement to support his allegation simply reciting the elements of claim in a complaint as plaintiff has done here is not sufficient to defeat a rule b motion see bell atl  s ct at  and to the extent that pocino’s conduct or words were solely directed at plaintiff those claims are dismissed because they were not published to a third party see muzio  wl  at  explaining that publication to a third party is a required element of a defamation claim finally the allegation that pocino provided rossein with false information cannot be construed as a claim for defamation by implication but simply as a claim for defamation this claim is futile because plaintiff has not identified the allegedly defamatory words or writings that pocino passed on to rossein additionally anything pocino said to rossein for the purposes of rossein’s investigation is protected by a qualified privilege see loksen  fd at  and plaintiff has not sufficiently pled actual or commonlaw malice with respect to pocino  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of   singh plaintiff alleges that singh “willfully and maliciously provided false information to law enforcement authorities with the intent to have plaintiff arrested and prosecuted” spsac ¶  he further alleges that “singh willfully and maliciously provided false information

columbia’s purported statement that plainitff the spsac contains two paragraphs numbered “” these statements come from the second such paragraph  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  engaged in shady dealings is not definite enough to state a claim see reilly  fd at  holding that claim that “something bad” had been said about plaintiff failed to state a claim and afford adequate notice to defendant plaintiff’s claim that columbia’s subordinates posted a defamatory picture of him also fails to state a claim in regard to columbia under new york law an employer can be held liable for its subordinates’ statements under the theory of respondeat superior if those statements were made in the course of performance of the employee’s duties see rausman v baugh  nysd   app div  see also riviello v waldron  ned   ny  discussing respondeat superior in the employeremployee context although “there is no single mechanical test to determine whether at a particular moment an employee is engaged in the employer’s business” rausman  nysd at  the following factors have been identified as important to the inquiry  whether the employee’s act fell within the discretion and control of the employer  whether the employee acted under the express or implied authority of the employer  whether the employee’s act was in furtherance of the employer’s interests  whether the employee’s acts were in the “discharge of duty” to the employer  whether the act was in execution of the employer’s orders or part of the work assigned by the employer and  whether the acts were “so closely connected” with what the employee was hired to do and “so fairly and reasonably incidental to it that they may be regarded as methods even though quite improper ones of carrying out the objectives of employment” id at  internal citations omitted in addition courts have noted that “there is no respondeat superior liability for torts committed for personal motives unrelated to the  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  furtherance of the employer’s business” murray v watervliet city school dist  nysd   app div  internal quotations and citation omitted the extent of the allegations against columbia is that he “knew” that some subordinates had posted a picture of plaintiff on the computer system spsac ¶  this allegation is not enough to implicate any of the six factors identified above which means that plaintiff has no claim against columbia based on respondeat superior if any claim lies here at all it is against the person or persons who created and uploaded the image who may have done so for their own reasons see murray  nysd at  thus this claim is also futile e protective order proskauer requests that limited portions of the parties’ submissions be sealed in particular proskauer notes several paragraphs in the psac ¶¶   and  where plaintiff divulges legal advice given by proskauer to the mtcdtf that plaintiff learned in his prior role as trustee proskauer also argues that plaintiff’s consistent “mudslinging” warrants a protective order denying public access there is a general presumption in favor of public access to judicial records this presumption is based on the need to hold the federal courts accountable to the public and to foster confidence in the administration of justice see united states v amodeo  fd   d cir  “amodeo ii” although courts have a variety of internal checks – appellate review in particular – public monitoring is an essential method for imposing democratic control and deterring arbitrary judicial behavior see id such public monitoring however is impossible without access to the testimony and documents used by the courts in the performance of their article iii functions see id  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  in lugosch v pyramid co of onondaga the second circuit enumerated the steps that a district court must take when determining whether to issue a protective order denying public access to records  fd  d cir  first a court must determine whether the  the court has analyzed proskauer’s requests in light of the common law right of access not a constitutional right of access in lugosch the second circuit held that “there exists a qualified first amendment right of access to documents submitted to the court in connection with a summary judgment motion” lugosch  fd at  emphasis added the court then noted that a constitutional right of access necessitated a more strict balancing test for keeping records under seal whereas under the common law documents may be kept under seal if “countervailing factors” are shown the constitutional analysis requires “specific ontherecord findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values” and a sealing order which is “narrowly tailored to achieve that aim” id the court in lugosch resisted determining however whether the attorneyclient privilege was a sufficiently compelling reason to satisfy the “higher values” and “narrow tailoring” required to seal documents under the first amendment id at  noting that “the attorneyclient privilege might well be such a compelling reason” to seal documents covered by the constitutional right to access the court remanded the case in part to further develop the facts in connection with this particular point of law upon remand magistrate judge treece recommended that the attorneyclient privilege and work product doctrine were “the highest values within our judicial system and constitute compelling reasons under the first amendment and countervailing factors under the common law that sufficiently outweigh the public’s right of access” lugosch v congel no  civ   wl  at  ndny mar   magistrate treece qualified this recommendation however by stating that a party could not attempt to seal a document on privilege grounds if the party requesting the protective order was the same party that interjected the privileged documents into the litigation id at  noting that waiver of the privilege only occurs when the party that claims the privilege interjects the privileged material into the litigation this line of precedent is still developing the second circuit has not yet determined whether a constitutional right of access exists in regard to judicial documents other than those relating to summary judgment such as the motion to file the psac in the instant case in fact at least one court has ruled that certain documents submitted in connection with a rule b motion to dismiss are not “judicial” and therefore not covered by a constitutional right of access see standard inv chateau no  civ   wl  at  sdny sept   if however such a right does exist the protective order requested by proskauer appears to fit comfortably within the emerging constitutional analysis developed in the two lugosch decisions proskauer’s request relates to statements allegedly protected by the attorneyclient privilege that were introduced into the litigation by plaintiff rather than proskauer furthermore proskauer’s request is narrowly tailored – only three paragraphs out of several hundred therefore if constitutional analysis is applicable to the instant case the result would be the same  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  documents are “judicial documents id at  to qualify as a judicial document “‘the item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process’” id quoting amodeo ii  fd at  if the documents are deemed nonjudicial then there is no presumption of public access and the movant need only make a baseline showing of good cause in order to justify the imposition of a protective order see standard inv chateau no  civ   wl  at  sdny sept   if however the court determines that the documents are judicial in nature there is a presumption of public access id second the court determines the weight of the presumption the weight of the presumption is “governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of the article iii judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts” lugosch  fd at  quoting amodeo ii  fd at  the material at issue “will fall somewhere on a continuum from matters that directly affect the adjudication to matters that come within a court’s purview solely to insure their irrelevance” id finally after the court has determined the weight of the presumption of access “the court must ‘balance competing considerations against it’” lugosch  fd at  quoting amodeo ii  fd at  see also standard inv chartered inc  wl  at  these competing considerations include inter alia “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure” lugosch  fd at  quoting amodeo ii  fd at  the court reviews proskauer’s request to seal portions of the psac in light of this three step analysis first the psac is clearly a judicial document as noted in section iia of this opinion supra plaintiff’s motion to file a proposed second amended complaint is assessed under rule b under rule b the court assesses plaintiff’s claim by determining  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  whether plaintiff has alleged “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” bell atl  s ct at  the b motion depends entirely upon the legal sufficiency of plaintiff’s pleadings see newman  fd at  “in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under fedrcivp b a district court must limit itself to facts stated in the complaint or in documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated in the complaint by reference” quoting kramer v time warner inc  fd   d cir  as a result the plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint must necessarily be a judicial document – the motion currently before the court hinges on the court’s assessment of the adequacy of the allegations in that document second the weight of that presumption should be considerable for many of the same reasons just enumerated the motion currently before the court pertains to the legal sufficiency of the document that proskauer would like to seal plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint as a result public access to the psac is necessary to monitor the decision of the in standard investment chartered inc the court held that “documents submitted in connection with a rule b motion cannot qualify as judicial” see standard inv chartered inc  wl  at  the key language here is the phrase “in connection” noting that a court is restricted in its ability to go outside the pleadings in assessing a rule b motion judge kram held that documents submitted “in connection” with a b motion are not judicial documents as they cannot play any role in the court’s deliberations id explaining that only documents that a court “could legitimately rely upon” qualify as judicial documents see also in re policy mgmt sys corp no  civ   wl  at  th cir  same if such documents were used by a court the motion would no longer be a rule b motion for dismissal but rather a rule  motion for summary judgment see standard inv chartered inc  wl  at  documents submitted “in connection” with a b motion are judicial documents but rather whether the complaint itself is a judicial document the answer hinges on whether the court “could legitimately rely upon” the documents in forming its decision id the complaint or in this case the proposed second amended complaint is the sort of document that the court must rely upon as it is the principal object of plaintiff’s motion to amend the issue before this court is quite different the court is not assessing whether  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  court without access to the psac the public would be unable to “assess the correctness of the judge’s decision” see lugosch  fd at  quotations omitted the final question is whether the “competing considerations” noted by proskauer – attorney client privilege and unwarranted mudslinging – are sufficient to overcome the presumption against denying public access the court initally agrees with proskauer in regard to its narrow request to seal the three statements in the psac that implicate only the attorney client privilege see rapkin v rocque  f supp d   d conn  “we agree with defendants that the public interest in preserving the attorneyclient privilege ordinarily outweighs the presumption of access to judicial documents see also diversified group inc v daugerdas  f supp d   sdny  noting that attorneyclient privilege “would be sufficient to outweigh the presumption of access if the summary judgment documents were replete with privileged attorneyclient communications” however the court does not agree in regard to the “mudslinging” claims while the second circuit’s analysis does invite consideration of broad privacy interests and while the court is troubled by some of the cavalier statements by plaintiff’s counsel about defendants in this case the statements in the psac do not “gratify private spite or promote public scandal” to such a degree that they overcome the presumption against sealing judicial records see amodeo ii  fd at  the portions of the psac identified by proskauer as containing privileged communications ¶¶   and  are to be sealed for ten days to allow plaintiff to explain in a letter no longer than three pages why they should not be so sealed in addition this opinion will remain sealed for ten days after which it will be unsealed if there are no objections from the parties if the parties do have objections they are instructed to identify for the court any  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  portions of the opinion which should be kept under seal beyond the tenday period any objections should be presented to the court in a letter no longer than three pages failure to strictly honor these deadlines will result in a waiver of any objections the party has to the sealing decisions outlined herein f amendment of the complaint plaintiff has thirty days to file a second amended complaint consistent with this opinion this second amended complaint will be the final version of the complaint permitted by the court plaintiff already has attempted to amend his complaint on five separate occasions – he will not receive a sixth opportunity see dluhos v floating  abandoned vessel known as ny  fd   d cir  recognizing liberal standard for granting leave to amend “nonetheless a motion to amend should be denied if there is an ‘apparent or declared reasonsuch as undue delay bad faith or dilatory motive  repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of the allowance of the amendment or futility of amendment’ ” quoting foman v davis  us    chill v general electric co  fd   d cir   “futility is a good reason to deny leave to amend” quotations and citation omitted mackensworth v ss american merchant  fd   d cir  “although leave to amend shall be freely granted when justice requires valid reasons for denying leave to amend include undue delay bad faith or futility of the amendment” citations omitted indeed counsel for plaintiff has repeatedly mentioned her desire to move this case along further skirmishing over any additional amendments will only undermine that interest in addition plaintiff will serve a copy of the second amended complaint on the other parties in this action prior to submitting the final  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  case cvrjs document  filed  page  of  service list ruth m pollack esq  west main st po box  riverhead new york    fax   counsel for
