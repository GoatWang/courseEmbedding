ingridlunden  shares next story ar display maker lumus grabs 3m in new funding from htc quanta after failing to complete its  billion merger with polycom earlier this year when polycom instead got acquired by siris capital for  billion today mitel networks began the process of streamlining its business to go forth alone or find another acquisition or merger as a simpler company today mitel announced that it would divest mitel mobility its mobile operations to xura for  million in cash plus a 3 million noninterest bearing promissory note and an equity interest in sierra private investments lp the limited partnership that will own both xura and the mobile division mitel plans now to focus its business more squarely on unified communications coincidentally xura like polycom was also acquired earlier this year by siris for  million alongside this deal xura also announced another acquisition it’s also buying ranzure which develops g radio access network technology for an undisclosed sum we’re trying to find out the price and will update when and if we do the ranzure deal is in part to acquire talent and it points to a tangled thread through all of this pardeep kohli who founded ranzure and was its ceo will become the new ceo of xura as part of the deal before ranzure kohli was the ceo of mavenir systems which was acquired by mitel in  for  million and became mitel mobility which is what’s getting sold today along with ranzure it’s unclear what the value is of mitel’s equity interest in sierra but taking just the cash portion of the deal on its own this deal represents a significant hit to mitel the divestment by mitel and acquisitions by xura speak to the ongoing trend of consolidation in the world of enterprise it services here xura is buying assets to build out a larger operation in virtualised network technologies for g networks and specifically their focus on internet of things applications alongside ranzure’s g ran technology through

in a statement “i would like to acknowledge outgoing ceo philippe tartavull for his significant contributions to the company during this transformational period today’s announcement marks a new and exciting chapter for xura and will accelerate and enhance the combined company’s ability to grow and deliver value to its customers partners and employees” he continued while the mobility part of mitel’s business is moving to xura mitel is going to focus more on unified communications which was the part of the business that it had been hoping to align up with polycom before that deal died “in a period of rapid change and massive technology transitions scale and focus are key to driving growth and shareholder return this transaction will allow mitel to achieve these goals” said rich mcbee ceo of mitel in a statement “it also enables us to intensify our focus and capital in expanding our leadership position in the enterprise market as it prepares for large scale digital transformation
