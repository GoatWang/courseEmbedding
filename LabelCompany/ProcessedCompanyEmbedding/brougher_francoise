brougher and she comes straight from spending eight years at google for the past three years brougher held the title of smb global sales and operations for the online advertising unit at google although square has grown its footprint considerably in part because of its highprofile partnership with starbucks the company has yet to announce its plans to address the international market today the service is only available in the us and canada which has allowed a plethora of competitors to thrive overseas especially in european markets where companies like izettle  sumuppayleven mpowa and intuit have already launched here’s what square cofounder and ceo jack dorsey had to say about the hiring francoise is a perfect fit for square her accomplishments in growing and managing large global teams and her focus on building simple scalable solutions that empower millions of people will have a huge impact on our company and our customers according to brougher’s linkedin page she had a hand in advertising operations for all of google’s online advertisers policy quality and ad approvals as well as working on fraud and risk these are skills that are going to come in handy for square’s payment processing team brougher’s reason for leaving google and joining square is to spend time helping small businesses “find the tools they need to grow and be successful” she went on to thank her former colleagues at google for “what we’ve achieved together” broughner played a huge role in bringing in advertisers to the system very early on which now counts for revenue that allows google to
