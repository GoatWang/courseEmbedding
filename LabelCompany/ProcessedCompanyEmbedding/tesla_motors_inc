premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search tesla motors inc to unveil product next week what will tesla announce daniel sparks tmfdanielsparks oct   at pm elon musk at a tesla event image source tesla motors electriccar maker tesla motors nasdaqtsla plans to host a product unveiling on oct  ceo elon musk announced on twitter over the weekend exactly what the new product will be is unknown but previous comments from management offer some suggestions heres what there is to know ahead of teslas event on monday what it wont be tesla product unveiling on the th unexpected by most musk tweeted on sunday the cryptic language was enough to prompt speculation while simultaneously leaving investors pretty much clueless thanks a lot elon fortunately musk did rule out one announcement when he tweeted that the event would be followed by teslasolarcity on the th this statement referenced a previous tweet in september noting the company was aiming to reveal its new solar roof with an integrated secondgeneration energy storage product and a tesla charger on oct  its not clear whether this oct  product announcement is contingent on the closing of its acquisition attempt of solar panel company solarcity  a deal tesla hopes to close in the fourth quarter of  but it looks like tesla is continuing to plan on the event even as the two companies remain separate so teslas oct  announcement likely wont be related to energy storage or solarcitys upcoming solarroof product what it might be besides teslas promised nextgeneration energy storage products there are two pending events management has previously said it would hold in the near future a part  demonstration of its model  and a more advanced version of autopilot could the unveiling have to do with either of these upcoming announcements just before tesla first unveiled its model  design on march  musk said the event was just part  of the model  unveil part  which takes things to another level will be close to production model  prototype image source tesla motors since model  deliveries arent expected to begin until late  a part  model  unveiling next week is unlikely a more likely announcement for october is a nextgeneration autopilot system when musk was asked at recodes code conference  about whether model  would have autonomous driving capabilities the ceo said tesla would host an event later in  to talk more about that heres an excerpt from musks conversation with recodes walt mossberg and kara swisher mossberg the model  will have autonomous for  musk i have a  im going to do another tesla event maybe by the end of the year to talk more about that mossberg well so you can start here musk it will be real big news if i start here mossberg we dont mind that musk let me just say that were going to do the obvious thing mossberg and swisher ok musk its really obvious currently teslas autopilot system puts all the responsibility on the driver serving as a driverassist technology autopilot automatically steers brakes and changes lanes on the highway but it requires that drivers remain alert keeping their hands on the wheel and ready to take control if the autopilot fails to drive correctly a more advanced autopilot system might bring tesla vehicles closer to full autonomy as musk as warned repeatedly though regulation will likely lag advancements toward autonomy so its unlikely even a more advanced system would readily relieve drivers of their driving responsibilities of course tesla could very well announce something totally different from these two products musk has hinted at while next weeks announcement in and of itself could be enough to impact an investing thesis in the stock investors should file this as a big unknown until its clear exactly what

tesla product line that is not a car musk said on twitter monday morning major new tesla product line  not a car  will be unveiled at our hawthorne design studio on thurs pm april  — elon musk elonmusk march   while we cant be certain the new product line musk is referring to is probably the companys home battery the ceo teased during its fourthquarter earnings call in february were going to unveil sort of the tesla home battery  consumer battery  that will be for use in peoples houses or businesses fairly soon musk explained we have the design done and it should start going into production probably in about six months or so  musk went on to say that tesla was trying to figure out a date to have the product unveiling and noted that it will probably be in the next month or two the timing of an april  announcement coincides with musks timeline for a battery unveil what would a home battery be for to get a better understanding of the products purpose look to solar company solarcity nasdaqscty where musk is chairman solarcity ceo lyndon rive musks cousin said last year that the company would eventually sell every home solar system with a batterystorage system musk has said that tesla will supply at least some of the batteries solarcity will need to offer this service solarcitys demandlogic energy system pairs solar panels with tesla batteries image source solarcity teslas next frontier tesla is taking its foray into energy storage seriously musks righthand man tesla chief technology officer jb straubel who leads teslas energy storage and battery efforts has said that tesla is as much an energy innovation company as it is a car company solarcity solar panels image source solarcity just how serious of a business does tesla imagine energy storage to be for the company the best measurement we have of teslas expectations is a comment from musk that as much as onethird of the gigafactorys output will be intended for stationary storage with the company planning to produce  gigawatt hours of pack output per year by  therefore tesla may be aiming for  gigawatt hours of this pack output to be used for energy storage  or four times the watt hour storage used to support teslas  vehicle production for teslas energy storage business to take off tesla is betting costs for solar panels and lithiumion batteries will continue to fall the lower the costs for solar panels and batteries the larger teslas addressable market for a home battery system of course its still not clear that a home battery will actually be the major new tesla product line unveiled on

advertisement tsla stock could this be tesla motors inc’s new product by mukta samtani published  october   this cannot solve problems at tesla motors tesla motors inc nasdaqtsla stock lost about two percent on friday and closed the session at  continuing its downward trend then ceo elon musk sent a tweet over the weekend that the company’s surprise product now won’t be unveiled until wednesday as it needed more refinements earlier he had announced that the unveiling of a new tesla product would be today monday this does not bode well for tsla stock or the company’s reputation such developments only reinforce the opinion that musk is in a hurry to move on to new challenges instead of taking care of the old ones the media is full of stories guessing what the new “unexpected” product might be as per a survey conducted last week around  of people expected it to be “autopilot tesla vision” and  expected it to be “tesla glass” source “tesla is about to unveil an ‘unexpected’ product what do you think it will be poll” electrek october   if indeed autopilot  is the new product to be unveiled on wednesday this is not what the company or tsla stock needs right now at a time when many doubt tesla’s promise to meet its delivery targets what the company needs to do is fix the production problems at tesla as more competitors challenge tesla with their own electric vehicles the new product should be one that strengthens tesla’s lead in this segment sponsored advertising content will tesla make you rich like the ford shareholders of  get free report here more challenges for tesla’s autopilot it was reported on sunday that german transport minister alexander dobrindt asked tesla to stop advertising its cars as having an “autopilot” function the word autopilot suggests that the car can run on its own without the drivers’ attention which is misleading to potential buyers the right term to use would be “driver assistance system” source “germany says tesla should not use ‘autopilot’ in advertising” reuters october   autopilot has always been under intense scrutiny following tesla car crashes in different parts of the world this has had negative impact on tsla stock autopilot function was also the reason that mobileye nv nysembly had a falling out with the company mobileye was clear that autopilot was a driver assistance system only and could not be a driverless system as tesla was promoting it to be meanwhile musk wants to convince everyone that tesla’s autopilot system is twice as safe as human drivers although the company’s collaboration with panasonic corporation adr otcmktspcrfy for solar energy parts may bear fruit in the future tesla’s merger with solarcity corp nasdaqscty is yet to go through this is another example of how musk is a man in great hurry elon musk needs to convince investors that the company can meet its production targets and take care of its financial troubles if this message is not clear there is not much upside

api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
