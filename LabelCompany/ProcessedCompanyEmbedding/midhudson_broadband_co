internet in the united states   broadband coveragenationwide cable coveragewhen it comes to residential internet in the united states cable is one of the most common forms of access currently covering over  million americanswhile plans and speeds vary tremendously between areas all cable service is provided through coaxial cable the same stuff that traditional analog tv service was provided to deliver fast and reliable “last mile” internet access to consumersaccording to industry reports the latest cable technology docsis  has been deployed to  of households and is capable of download speeds faster than  mbpsfor more details about the number of providers and what communities they serve weve compiled a full list of every provider offering cable service in the united statesshould you get cable internet serviceif you don’t have access to fiber optic internet in your area cable internet service may be your best bet for a fast reliable internet connectionjust make sure to research your cable provider first to understand their reputations with regards to customer service data caps and billing transparency benefitslarge coverage areabecause cable internet services leverage the existing infrastructure there is wide coverage across the continental united states and is a great solution for reliable wired broadband accessrelatively fast speedswith the latest versions of docsis  and beyond cable internet is a good solution for delivering fast download and upload speeds that will support most consumer needslow latencycable internet has a much lower latency than other service types allowing for a faster “round trip” of data making the connection much faster than other alternatives such as fixed wireless or satellite limitationselectrical basedsince cable technology uses electrical currents to transmit data the bandwidth capabilities and future usefulness of coaxial cables will be pale in comparison to those of fiber optic connectionslimited providersdue to the cost of creating a coaxial infrastructure many areas only have access to one cable provider leaving customers with limited selection of serviceshelp make finding broadband easier share with your friends what is cable broadbandcable broadband is a method of delivering highspeed internet to residences and businesses using cable television infrastructuresimilar to dsl fiber and fixed wireless connections cable bridges the “last mile” between the mainstream internet “backbone” and customer residences cable bridges the “last mile” between the mainstream internet “backbone” and customer residences broadbandnowcable is similar to dsl in that both use copper cables to deliver data as electrical signal as opposed to fiber cables which use optical signal essentially light while dsl uses oldfashioned copper telephone wires cable broadband uses the same coaxial copper cables that deliver sound and video to cable television subscribers cable provides speeds and bandwidth similar to dsl offerings with most residential plans offering between –mbps for downloads and –mbps for uploads in theory cable wires are more advanced than dsl wiring allowing for greater bandwidth and faster speeds in practice cable connections are “shared” within neighborhoods using a technology called statistical multiplexing this brings down prices for consumers and providers at the cost of slightly reduced speeds particularly during peak use times components of a cable broadband networkmost “cable” broadband connections are technically hybrid fiber coaxial hfc connectionsin an hfc connection a “trunk” fiber optical cable covers the distance between the provider and a local service area once there it terminates at an optical node which translates the optical signal to electrical signal the electrical signal is routed via “branches” of coaxial cable to individual homes where cable modems split internet and tv signal and deliver it to a home network in some cases repeaters or amplifiers are used to boost signal every  meters or so  components of a cable broadband network broadbandnowhow coaxial cables workdigital data is in essence strings of binary “onoff” signals generally represented as zeros and ones everything you experience when you use the internet is stored as digital data how coaxial cables work broadbandnowwhen you tune in to a tv channel you’re selecting a particular “slice” of the signal being transmitted over that cable just like selecting a channel on wireless radio in simple terms broadband cable internet takes up one of those “channels” on a coaxial cablethe biggest difference between broadband internet data and traditional tv data is that internet data goes both ways as users upload and download content to prevent signals from interfering with one another coaxial cables are “split” using – mhz for downloads and – mhz for uploads  upstream and downstream frequencies broadbandnowless spectrum is allocated for uploads because most consumers download much more content than they upload this is why cable and dsl broadband connections are often marketed as “asynchronous” anatomy of a coaxial cablethe traditional “cable networks” that cable broadband uses to bridge the “last mile” are composed of copper coaxial cablescoaxial cables have a variety of parts each designed to protect and transmit electrical signals as precisely and efficiently as possible anatomy of coaxial cable broadbandnow central copper conductor carries electromagnetic signal this will often be coppercoated steel rather than pure copper which increases the strength of the cable high frequencies tend to travel on the outside of a conductive wire a phenomena called “skidding” allowing the steel central strength member to avoid interfering with the cable’s carrying capacity plastic dielectric insulator maintains uniform distance between center wire and outer foil aluminum foil foil essentially bounces high frequency signal back to the center wire as it tries to escape the cable foil also blocks high frequency electromagnetic interference from outside the cable braided copper this layer has a similar function to the foil but the braided copper construction makes it particularly effective at canceling out lowfrequency electromagnetic interference from outside outer jacket usually made from pvc the outer jacket protects the interior of the cable repelling water animals and other contaminants once installedthe term “coaxial” refers to the shared axis between the central copper conductor and outer foilmesh layer maintaining this uniform axis or distance between the center conductor wire and outer meshfoil creates a stable environment for signal to move defining the “capacity” of the cable anatomy of coaxial cable broadbandnowthe mesh also serves to protect the signal inside from electromagnetic interference outside the cable allowing the signal to travel farther before it deteriorates to envision this think about mass transportation a traditional dsl cable is like a bus it’ll get from point a to point b but it’s constantly slowed down by outside traffic coaxial cable is like a subway line with the mesh wrapper acting as the tunnel wall no interference from other vehicles translates to faster more reliable transportationtranslating data how docsis worksin an ideal situation broadband data would be delivered to subscribers via direct bidirectional cables cable has two big roadblocks to this sort of ideal setup first coaxial cables are not designed to be bidirectional since they were originally designed for oneway broadcast media specifically television second they are not direct since residence connections are shared starting at the local nodecable broadband providers work around these issues by using docsis an acronym for data over cable service interface specifications docsis is a suite of specifications developed by cablelabs a nonprofit research organization how docsis

not be able to get uninterrupted hdquality tv on this level of internet cable and fiber are by far your best options it is also highly advisable to get a quality wireless router that suits your home especially if you plan on watching sports how fast does my interent need to be the average internet speed in america is around  mbps if you are the only one in your home and will only stream shows occasionally then any internet speed will do for you except dialup however if you have kids streaming alongside the parents you will need  mbps or more for a decent quality streaming experience these speeds are only available with premium isps like cable ugh dsl or fios fiber  bandwidth limits one thing that typically hidden in most broadband contracts is that they have bandwidth caps that can easily be breached if your household watches a lot of netflix amazon prime video or any of the others it is definitely important to look into this before choosing an isp most of the time once you go over your allotted bandwidth amount you will be charged for overages example my household of  kids  adults will usually go through between  and gb of traffic a month  streaming media players for hulu

this filing artboard  offering circular url copied to clipboard unfortunately there is no html record of this filing mid hudson region rural technology  broadband alliance  rural broadband company  rural broadband company   rule  midhudson region rural technology  broadband alliance executive summary map request information executive summary introduction this funding opportunity will provide resources for the construction of a carrierneutral broadband and telecommunications network in dutchess and ulster counties new york funding will also be provided for digital readiness training with a view towards making computer training available so that community members may better access important services and business opportunities many of which are now cloudbased with the advent of cloud computing heavy industrial users of broadband have suffered a net loss of broadband capacity when considering the needs and speeds of today’s commercial enterprises we originated the midhudson region rural technology  broadband alliance the alliance in  when a medical company retained us to process broadband grant applications under a federal program for broadband expansion   entrepreneurial spirit since that time the pool of funding opportunities has grown and now includes exempt limited offerings pursuant to the congressionallyapproved amendments to the rules of the securities and exchange commission the sec such rule changes allow for certain exempt limited offerings to be shown on the internet for the first time america’s entrepreneurial spirit drives our project the federal communications commission’s the fcc executive summary as contained in its national broadband plan provides “congress also required that this plan include a detailed strategy for achieving… entrepreneurial activity… and economic growth …” consistent with this federal mandate our goal is to provide for shareholder value and growth over the long term on this project a key project goal therefore is for revenue flow to begin as soon as we flip the switch on a project in this manner project valuation can best be gauged with a view toward demonstrating such ongoing and long term return on investment roi   job creation the national broadband plan also provided for job creation saying “congress also required that this plan include a detailed strategy for achieving……job creation…” thus a key economic driver of our projects concerns the addition of many new direct and secondary jobs in the areas of systems operations and management construction maintenance sales installation training digital readiness and others   economic forecasting – the aggregation model of return on investment economists utilize the aggregation model in order to predict return on investment and sustainability the new york state broadband mapping office has adopted this model among the factors that are included in this model are the utilization of community data on business location and projected growth in order to predict future industrial level broadband usage such industrial level broadband usage has a range of from  to  mbps another factor of anticipated increased broadband adoption concerns location of community anchor institutions that serve vulnerable populations the location of these institutions which in most cases provide a stable and long term community end user location assists in allowing for further analysis or aggregation of community services and therefore of economic forecasting   existing business locations add to the economic forecasting by researching the location of type size and other factors economists can utilize the aggregation model by adding for such revenue drivers as will allow for projected broadband usage at higher levels such highuse broadband can allow business to expand services especially with cloud computing by providing for such an infrastructure economists are able to calculate potential business stability and business location and relocation   carrierneutral infrastructure this project envisions a series of fiber connections to a series of new telecommunications towers and antennas this project infrastructure expansion will link to a ‘dark fiber’ network that can provide for broadband speeds at all levels in some instances existing infrastructure will be utilized with our project ‘colocating’ with those existing assets in all instances broadband capacity will be increased with speeds as noted herein a carrierneutral infrastructure is mandated by the fcc and drives all of the funding considerations for this project the implementation and funding of such infrastructures will create an open system one that is open to competition among incumbent carriers and also among any others that wish to expand into the project area our project campaign slogan ‘it’s your choice…it’s your broadband’ will resonate resulting in the carriers expanding their own sales and marketing resulting in more users of the system   community anchor institutions as economic drivers when the members of a community can learn how to better access information on the internet an expansion in the number of transactions that can be completed is multiplied thus resulting in economic expansion such transactions include egovernment ecommerce and expanded educational opportunities this project therefore includes an alliance of community anchor institutions that serve vulnerable populations such stakeholder groups allow us to form strategic partnerships with business and political leaders and groups in a manner that is consistent with state and federal policy directives for the expansion of rural broadband library systems are crucial members of our alliances in rural areas the proximity of library locations in the community serves to provide convenient digital readiness training centers for local business and government sectors the participation of the rural medical sector in this project including peripheral service centers will result in better services and increased economic activity the needs of the most vulnerable members of the community will also be better addressed with a high speed cloudbased infrastructure by providing for an expanded and competitive carrierneutral infrastructure these institutions will benefit the expansion of significant broadband to health information exchanges hie must be achieved without such high speeds the cloudbased medical management software cannot accomplish all of the necessary functions to achieve comprehensive patient care rural job training centers must achieve higher broadband speeds when considering their proximity to other government services and to business there is a clear need for expanded broadband job training centers provide for expanded job training and distance learning opportunities thus expanding the demand for more broadband and more digital readiness training   engineering a design for an economically successful rural broadband project the success of a rural broadband and digital readiness project is dependant on a successful engineering design such a design must take into consideration the key factors as described above first the design must fit with the economic projections second the design must provide for expanded broadband to rural areas that are either unserved or underserved the economic factors can provide for a successful project because by detailing the areas of the greatest need for the greatest speeds project funding resources can be directed to provide to a successful expansion put another way there can be no need for a  mbps broadband speed in a community that does not have any end users which would require such speeds thus to extend such a high speed system to those areas would be a waste of project funding resources at the same time many areas within the project boundaries remain unserved or underserved such areas deserve to have broadband and at speeds that will provide a minimum of connectivity to them with smart engineering broadband expansion into these areas can be designed so as to be cost effective and at the same time revenuegenerating somewhere in between the high need users and the underserved and unserved areas are parts of the project where speeds in the range of  to  mbps will provide for essential business and government expansion in a manner that is consistent with the community needs in most cases businesses that have chains of locations already need a minimum of  mbps at the same time with egovernment most local government services already or in the near future will need to process such transactions as tax filings online longstanding community anchor institutions including social services agencies libraries job centers medical offices and hospitals and educational facilities already need and require speeds of from  to  mbps a successful engineering design must include provisions for funding that is in addition to private capital investment in many cases depending on such factors as population density community interest and government grant programs engineering protocols can provide for tiered or layered mapping that is consistent with these areas for example with grant funding a typical requirement concerns areas that are either unserved andor underserved by knowing the location of such areas within each project we can direct investor resources to the components of those opportunities cash match requirements for example that could allow for the more efficient use of project resources similarly in cases of availability of rural loan programs for broadband factors such as area population can determine whether other avenues of funding can complement investor funding resources for example in some cases of federal rural broadband loan programs such programs provide for zero interest rate funding over many years among the qualifications to achieve such loans however are a matching cash component typically a percentage of the loan amount in these instances where there is investor funding for the cash match other investor funding can be routed to other areas of the project to achieve a greater revenuegenerating result with a top notch engineering plan therefore the revenue projections can allow us to detail investor project funding so as to provide the most efficient revenuegenerating result for the investor   community support by government leaders the support of our elected representatives is important to the success of our project we are thankful that a village mayor was the first elected official to voice public support for our project he has continued to provide leadership in the community for us for over four years others including town supervisors and county legislators have also provided their support in many cases at the county level certain committees are designated to evaluate and address questions of broadband we are thankful for the opportunity of presenting our projects to the members of those committees we are thankful to the ulster county legislature for passing a resolution in support of our alliance in some cases at the county executive level we have been honored with a letter of support we gain information and knowledge from the persons at the county executive level who address questions of economic development many such persons have provided tireless leadership in the development of our project as a result of that leadership our alliance was able to expand to provide for crucial broadband infrastructure expansion planning for other community anchor institution locations including for county mental health services locations we are thankful for the guidance that is provided by the regional offices of the new york regional economic development council agency we learned that access to crucial social services could be enhanced by digital readiness training programs and by expanded broadband access we received valuable input from local social services agencies we have received crucial support for site acquisition from community leaders we report to local building inspectors on a regular basis so as to keep them informed of project news as concerns sites and also existing and potential colocation sites our project is well known to other political and community leaders in washington both new york’s senators have been recipients of our consistent updates and we are thankful for the time taken by staffers to listen to our plans on the house side although some members have changed we remain thankful to staff members for allowing us to provide updates to their staffers   the new york broadband mapping office new york’s broadband program office is the ‘must go to’ office for this project development the office was opened in  from that time to the present the office has grown to become the office to achieve the latest information on carrierneutral broadband mapping in new york there can be no doubt of the importance of this office because investors will want to know that their investment dollars are not going into a project that will duplicate already existing projects or plans   digital readiness digital readiness describes a strategy for providing for training for computer users investors can recognize that a more digitally literate community can greatly expand the potential for economic growth and thus the perfect synergy of this project component with broadband infrastructure and capacity expansion the new york library association created the program ‘digital readiness in new york’ we are thankful to the projects director for continuing assistance on this project the program consists of designing curriculum for the training of library staff and others this ‘training the trainers’ program will allow for the trainers to greatly expand the digital readiness of all members of the community but particularly to members of the most vulnerable populations   policy considerations continue to drive project organization and development the broadband infrastructure and capacity as well as the digital readiness sectors must constantly adapt to the ever changing technology that makes obsolete some systems at an early stage put another way yesterday’s  mbps is today’s  mbps a growing number of policy considerations directives and laws therefore serve to add great cohesion to our two core project goals expanded rural broadband infrastructure and capacity along with digital readiness training for example the policy initiatives of the the fcc continue to serve as the core strategic directive in our efforts among these are included the ‘everyoneon’ initiative for the expansion of digital readiness the us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid has created an expanded portal for the acceleration of ehr called the ‘blue button initiative’ this initiative is incorporated into the digital readiness component of our project the initiative will also serve to expand on the ehr portal for america’s veterans now known as virtual lifetime electronic health record vler the fcc’s ‘connect america’ fund will provide for expanded benefits to customers of broadband providers thus allowing for the expansion of service in rural areas in new york the governor and lieutenant governor have directed the expenditure of more than  million in ‘connect new york’ grants among new york’s ten regional economic development councils   project philanthropy we seek to become a valued member of our project community one of our philanthropic goals includes providing funding contributions for conservation efforts in the project community our educational philanthropic goal seeks to provide necessary funding at both the national and community levels for programs that concentrate on efforts to provide educational components to america’s future farmers   conclusion the significant and successful origination organization and development of this project allows for a significant level of transparency for potential investors with the expansion of rules by the securities and exchange commission the investor’s access to projects like ours is greatly expanded creating a winwin for the project and potentially for the investor the detailing of project development with economic projections key data research in project areas smart engineering and the complementary availability of supplemental funding sources all allow for a better and more informed choice by the investor with an emphasis on providing expanded infrastructure and capacity for business the project area can achieve broadband speeds that are needed in today’s cloudcomputingbased technology by providing for successful broadband expansion to community anchor institutions greater efficiencies in transactions egovernment ecommerce and health benefits lift the project area into greater economic growth potential investors have the ability to view greater information we can provide a good deal of this information upon request we look forward to the successful funding of this project and we will works towards a goal of providing a long term revenue stream that will build shareholder value and company valuation for these critical infrastructure projects many states have differing rules and regulations concerning
