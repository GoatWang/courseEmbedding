futures over the course of a period of time there’s no question…i mean i’ve just experienced it myself” managedfutures funds such as the rjo global trust are a subset of hedge funds the funds are run by commoditytrading advisers or ctas   although most hedge funds typically charge a  percent management fee managedfutures funds often charge clients  to  percent of assets invested annually in this

trust is a delaware statutory trust organized on november   under the delaware statutory trust act the business of the trust is the speculative trading of commodity interests including futures contracts on currencies interest rates energy and agricultural products metals commodity indices and stock indices spot and forward contracts on currencies and precious metals and exchanges for physicals pursuant to the trading instructions of multiple advisors the managing owner acquired the managing owner interest in the trust from rcmi on november   the managing owner of the trust was initially formed as an illinois corporation in november  and became a delaware limited liability company in july of  the managing owner is registered as a commodity pool operator under the ceact and is responsible for administering the business and affairs of the trust the managing owner is an affiliate of rjo the trust has no officers directors or employees the managing owner is responsible for selecting monitoring and replacing the advisors to the trust the managing owner may change the allocation to each advisor or add remove or replace any advisor without the consent of or advance notice to investors investors will be notified of any material change in the basic investment policies or structure of the trust as of march   the advisors were the trust was originally established and operated as a singleadvisor commodity pool john w henry  company inc jwh served as the trusts sole trading advisor until october   as of november   the trust became a multiadvisor commodity pool where trading decisions for the trust were delegated to five independent advisors jwh ais futures management ais abraham trading corp atc global advisors lp galp and peninsula lp plp pursuant to advisory agreements executed between the trust and each advisor effective february   nw became the trusts sixth advisor as of march   plp was terminated as an advisor to the trust effective june   the trust entered into an advisory agreement with global advisors jersey limited gajl to replace its advisory agreement with galp in connection with galps initiative to migrate all of its clients to its jerseybased uk entity as of june   ais was terminated as an advisor to the trust and the trusts assets were reallocated with equal weighting of  each to the remaining four advisors along with conquest capital group ccg and haar capital management hcm beginning july   as of september   the advisors to the trust consisted of jwh nw atc gajl ccg and hcm beginning october   the trust entered into advisory agreements with two additional advisors on october   trigon investment management tim and dominion capital management institutional advisers inc dcm were each allocated approximately  of the trusts assets those eight advisors traded the trusts assets from october   to march   as of april   gajl was terminated and two new trading advisors were appointed and allocated less than  of the trusts assets at april   dcm tim and hcm were terminated as advisors ccg was terminated as of june   at march   the trust entered into an advisory agreement with lfg and hbc at june   the trust entered into an advisory agreement with aam at august   the trust entered into an advisory agreement with ga as such as of march   the trusts assets were allocated to the following advisors nw  hbc  lfg  aam  and ga  with the remaining percentage allocated to cash effective july   the managing owner discontinued the public offering of the units and began offering the units on a private placement basis only b capital resources the trusts capital resources fluctuate based upon the purchase and redemption of units and the gains and losses of the trusts trading activities for the threemonth period ended march   no units were purchased in class a and class b by beneficial owners the managing owner purchased no units during this time for the threemonth period ending march   the unitholders redeemed a total of  class a units for  and  class b units for  the trusts involvement in the futures and forward markets exposes the trust to both market risk  the risk arising from changes in the market value of the futures and forward contracts held by the trust  and credit risk  the risk that another party to a contract will fail to perform its obligations according to the terms of the contract the trust is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of the futures and forward contracts purchased and theoretically unlimited risk of loss on contracts sold short the advisors monitor the trusts trading activities and attempt to control the trusts exposure to market risk by among other things refining their respective trading strategies adjusting position sizes of the trusts futures and forward contacts and reallocating trust assets to different market sectors the trusts primary exposure to credit risk is through the nonperformance of the trusts forward currency broker citibank na citibank citibank generally enters into forward contracts with large wellcapitalized institutions and then enters into a backtoback contract with the trust the trust also may trade on exchanges that do not have associated clearing houses whose credit supports the obligations of its members and that operate as principals markets in which case the trust will be exposed to the credit risk of the other party to such trades the trusts trading activities involve varying degrees of offbalance sheet risk whereby changes in the market values of the futures and forward contracts underlying the financial instruments or the trusts satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount reported in the statement of financial condition of the trust the amount of assets invested in the trust generally does not affect its performance as typically this amount is not a limiting factor on the positions acquired by the advisors and the trusts expenses are primarily charged as a fixed percentage of its asset base however large or by number of investors to a lesser extent some expenses are incurred as minimums regardless of the size of the asset base such as audit and legal fees the trust borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly shortterm basis in order to finance losses on nonus dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the trusts us dollar deposits these borrowings are at a prevailing shortterm rate in the relevant currency they have been immaterial to the trusts operation to date and are expected to continue to be so during the threemonth period ending march   the trust had no material credit exposure to a counterparty which is a foreign commodities exchange there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the trusts capital resource arrangements at the present time c liquidity the trusts net assets are held in brokerage accounts with rjo such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the trusts trading except in very unusual circumstances the trust should be able to close out any or all of its open trading positions and liquidate any or all of its securities holdings quickly and at market prices this should permit the advisors to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should their programs indicate reducing market exposure the trust earns interest on  of its average daily balances on deposit with rjo during each month at  of the average fourweek treasury bill rate for that month in respect of deposits denominated in us dollars for deposits denominated in other currencies the trust earns interest at a rate of onemonth libor less  basis points for the quarters ended march   and march   the trust has received or accrued to receive trading interest of  and  respectively from rjo additionally effective october   the managing owner retained rjoim an affiliate of the managing owner to serve as a cash manager to the trust the trusts assets which are managed by the cash manager are held by wells as custodian to the trust as of march   wells held approximately  million of the trusts assets for the quarters ended march   and march   the assets held in this account earned  and  of interest income respectively most us commodity exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in commodity futures contract prices during a single trading day by regulations these regulations specify what are referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits the daily limits establish the maximum amount the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous trading days settlement price at the end of the session once the daily limit has been reached in a particular commodity no further trades may be executed at a price beyond the limit positions in the commodity could then be taken or liquidated only if traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit during the period for trading on such day because the daily limit rule only governs price movement for a particular trading day it does not limit losses in the past futures prices have moved the daily limit for numerous consecutive trading days and thereby prevented prompt liquidation of futures positions on one side of the market subjecting commodity futures traders holding such positions to substantial losses for those days it is also possible for an exchange or the cftc to suspend trading in a particular contract order immediate settlement of a particular contract or direct that trading in a particular contract be for liquidation only there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the trusts liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way additionally no material deficiencies in liquidity were identified and there are no material unused sources of liquid assets for the quarter ended march   d results of operations the trusts success depends on the advisors ability to recognize and capitalize on major price movements and other profit opportunities in different sectors of the world economy because of the speculative nature of its trading operational or economic trends have little relevance to the trusts results and its past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results the managing owner believes however that there are certain market conditions  for example markets with major price movements  in which the trust has a better opportunity of being profitable than in others certain advisors to the trust are technical traders and as such their programs do not predict price movements no fundamental economic supply or demand analysis is used in attempting to identify mispricings in the market and no macroeconomic assessment of the relative strengths of different national economies or economic sectors is made however there are frequent periods during which fundamental factors external to the market dominate prices for the discretionary advisors economic fundamentals and macroeconomic assessments are made the performance summaries set forth below outline certain factors that affected the performance of the trust for the periods presented the fact that certain trends or market movements were captured does not imply that others perhaps larger and potentially more profitable trends or market movements were not missed or that the advisors will be able to capture similar trends or movements in the future moreover the fact that the programs were profitable in certain market sectors in the past does not mean that they will be so in the future the performance summaries are an outline description of how the trust performed in the past not necessarily any indication of how it will perform in the future furthermore the general causes to which certain trends or market movements are attributed may or may not in fact have caused such trends or movements as opposed to simply having occurred at about the same time fiscal quarter ended march   the trust recorded net

percentage allocated to cash several reports out in january  noted that market participation by governments and central banks around the world reached unprecedented levels over the last few years this participation has suppressed market volatility and put off an ultimate response to ballooning global debt problems the us congress and president have pushed back budget discussions until late spring the stock market did not experience negative effects as a result the sp  jumped out to a  gain in january interest rates on the other hand have not reacted favorably to the recent developments the interest rate on the year us treasury while still low by historical standards has crept back into the  range after spending much of last year between  and  crude is creeping back towards  per barrel

in crude and gold led the commodity sector lower the dow jones ubs commodity index was down over  in february and is now negative for the year yield on the year us treasury found support at the  level and has now drifted back to  in part the commodity sell off and bounce in the treasury market was in response to the us government sequester that took place at month end february and was signed into law on march  the automatic spending cuts are expected to dampen economic activity and temporarily put off inflation concerns governments around the world continue to participate in the markets postponing more lasting solutions to the global economic challenges the ultimate market response to this unprecedented government participation is expected to be significant and could offer some investment opportunities in the managed futures sector in march the sp  posted new alltime highs rising  and finishing the quarter up nearly  for yeartodate the year us treasury returned  the commodity sector as reflected by the dow jones ubs commodity index rose  during march but remains in negative territory for the year down  governments and central banks around the world remain engaged and very active in their respective economies as they try to manage a fragile global economic recovery the strengthening us dollar and the rising us stock market appear to be the result of bleak situations in the european economies rather than outright strength of the us economy fiscal quarter ended march   the trust recorded net trading loss of  or  per trading unit for class a units and a
