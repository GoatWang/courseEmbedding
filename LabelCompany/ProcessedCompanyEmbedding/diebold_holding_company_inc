leadingedge systems integrator and solutions provider drawing upon its technology expertise in each of these key areas diebold develops integrated total solutions that enable customers to improve productivity reduce costs increase revenues protect assets and enhance consumer convenience company history in the wake of the  great chicago fire natural disaster proved a boon for diebold bahmann  co when word spread that all  diebold safes in the area along with their contents survived the flames the diebold safes reputation as a haven from the elements came full circle more than a century later when hurricane andrew devastated much of south florida in august  a bank executive in homestead florida the city that bore the worst of the storm reported weathering mileperhour winds in a diebold safe over the years diebold incorporated has diversified considerably becoming the international leader in the production sale and servicing of automated teller machines atms and pioneering in such areas as campus card systems smart card systems and automated medication dispensing systems while continuing to make safes office equipment and a variety of security and surveillance systems early history charles diebold first organized diebold bahmann in  as a manufacturer of safes and vaults in cincinnati ohio in  diebold had outgrown its space in cincinnati and transferred plant and headquarters to canton ohio where most of the postfire orders were filled in  wells fargo of san francisco chose diebold to make what would be the worlds largest vault the following year a special car train transported the footlong footwide foothigh vault to san francisco in  the company was incorporated under ohio law as diebold safe  lock co following the wells fargo feat diebold continued to traffic in the colossal selling the largestever commercial bank vault to detroit national bank in  in  the first national bank of chicago purchased the largestever double vault doors with a combined weight of  tons size aside the companys abiding interest lay in developing equipment to stay one step ahead of bank robbers in  the company introduced manganese steel doors that were billed as tntproof through time combination locks replaced keys which could be copied safety hinges were introduced along with locks that jammed automatically after banking hours the company made a splash in  by putting visually pleasing vault doors on the market in the process of mechanically redesigning its bank vault equipment the company canvassed bankers for suggested improvements to the standard the overwhelming answer was that a plain slab of steel particularly on the inside of the doorthe side customers seewas an unworthy complement to a banks carefully decorated public spaces the company then hired charles deaton a st louis industrial designer to retool both the interior and exterior of the vaults despite the fact that the newly designed vaults cost around twice as much as the simpler models they dominated new orders from customers began to diversify in the s while better and more secure vaults and safes continued to be key features in diebolds product line the market for safes and vaults has not always been dependable relying as it does on the health of the banking industry in the s diebold began to diversify in slightly over a decade the company made seven major moves toward expansion in  the company acquired united metal products co also of canton a manufacturer of hollow metal doors and door frames in  diebold made its first entrance into the office equipment business by introducing the cardineer rotary file system this was followed in  with the acquisition of the visible records equipment company of chicago a former subsidiary and a manufacturer of vertical filing systems and other recordkeeping equipment that same year diebold bought the patents and manufacturing rights for flofilm a process that allowed companies to microfilm records inhouse with a onehour automatic developer in  buying rights to the safetstak steel storage file further augmented diebolds growing office equipment business the following year diebold bought the safe and vault business of the york safe  lock company finally in january  the bank equipment division of ob mcclintock co of minneapolis went over to diebold the products acquired from mcclintock included burglar alarms a bank vault ventilator in case of lockins and afterhour depositories amidst these acquisitions in  the company changed its name to diebold incorporated to better reflect its diversified product line several factors motivated diebolds first expansion world war ii brought the safe and vault business as a whole out of rough years with a flurry of government armament contracts following the dismal economy of the s the war created a demand for manufacturers accustomed to highprecision work with hardened steels for diebold as well as its main competitors york safe and mosler safe co the war effort spelled a windfall in  diebold which had previously grossed around  million per year brought in  million when the dust settled and the contracts disappeared with the end of the war the company was fiscally sound but its executives were having trouble agreeing on diebolds path of postwar reconversion amid the confusion eliot ness joined the companys board in  a former prohibition agent of the untouchables fame and cleveland director of safety he represented the rex family who owned the largest single block of diebold shares  percent ness who became chairman of the board engineered a spectacular takeover of york safe located in york pennsylvania york was the largest prewar producer of safes and vaults with a strong sales base on the east coast however the company had let its sales division deteriorate during the war while diebolds was intact seeing yorks weakness diebold moved in the deal came together with the help of clint murchison sr a texas oilman and a friend of future chairman daniel maggin murchison arranged for several insurance companies to make loans to diebold for the purchase and personally guaranteed them diebold acquired all of yorks patents tools service contracts and orders as well as its sales branches however the york company had diversified to include plastics production and microfilm equipment and diebold left the remaining business freestanding under the name york industries inc expansion continued in the s and s in the s diebold cashed in on americas postwar migration to suburban areas which created a demand for new bank branches and orders for safes as well as the full complement of office and security equipment thanks to its expansion during the s the company was able to meet the new demand for its products the automobileoriented suburban life brought buyers for the companys drivein teller windows which diebold had started selling after the purchase of mcclintock along with the dieboldmcclintock burglar alarm and several models of afterhour depositories in  diebold acquired k f kline co a maker of steel lockers shelving parts storage bins and storage and wardrobe cabinets the kline acquisition combined with diebolds previous business in recordhandling and storage equipment brought business equipment to account for approximately  percent of total volume in  in august  diebold acquired the entire stock of herringhallmarvin safe co of canada ltd which became the diebold company of canada limited in september  diebold acquired herringhallmarvin safe co of hamilton ohio in addition to safes herringhall made teller counter equipment and the acquisition expanded diebolds range of service to banks even further the us government subsequently took the merger to court on antitrust grounds saying that diebold and herringhall were two of only three companies in the united states producing bank vault equipment the southern district court of ohio dismissed the case on the socalled failing company doctrine under which an acquisition in danger of antitrust challenges could be justified if it could be shown that the object of a takeover was in such poor shape that its continued existence would not substantially have altered the competitive environment in  the justice department asked the supreme court to review the case saying that the defense should be less broadly defined the high court recommended that the district court that dismissed the case should try it in april  before a trial could take place diebold and the justice department reached an agreement diebold would sell the safe and vault part of the herringhallmarvin operation within the year and agree not to buy any other vault or safe companies for another five years that limitation would be stretched to  years if herringhall was not sold within that time frame in the meantime diebold continued to expand along with the postwar growth in the number of banks in the country the late s and early s saw an explosion in the perperson use of checks this prompted diebold to buy into the checkimprinting business in  the company acquired consolidated business systems inc and its subsidiary young  selden that company was a maker of business forms and magnetic ink imprinting for checks diebold then sold off the business forms part of the business at a loss but profitably ventured further into the check business with the purchase of the thrifticheck service corporation later the same year diebold sold some assets of young  selden in  and all of thrifticheck in  diebold was first listed on the new york stock exchange in april  under the symbol dbd in  the company added the products of the lamson corporation of syracuse new york to its line of office equipment a maker of materialshandling systems lamson became a division of diebold among its products was a messagecarrying system that used pneumatic tubes when diebold took over it expanded the operations of the syracuse plant and invested in research and development resulting in the computerregulated tube transport systems that were used to carry material between floors in large office buildings and continue to be used in driveup remote teller stations in  diebold acquired florida development services a clearwater florida company that made modular bank buildings those structures used for small branch offices could be transported to a site and assembled within  days the following year the name was changed to diebold contracting services inc the concern was sold in  quickly became atm leader in s in the early s diebold was faced with a slowdown in sales of security equipment the company led by longtime president and ceo raymond koontz decided to respond by looking ahead and taking a chance on atms diebold invested heavily in electronic research applied computer technology ergonomic design and software development and in  introduced the first atm model the atm trade turned out to be a natural for the company that had been doing business with banks for over a century while diebold was a relative newcomer to this type of computer technology its experience with cashhandling systems and security concerns made diebold atms an attractive choice for banks within five years up against competing products from ibm ncr burroughs trw and honeywell diebold had captured  percent of the domestic market in  banks using diebold atms included bank of america citibank marine midland and the shawmut corp through the early s the business press portrayed diebolds atm dominance over ibm and ncr as the pinstriped battle between david and a twoheaded goliath those three letters ibm are the first thing we think of when we awake forbes quoted earl wearstler then diebold executive vicepresident as saying in  but diebold held its ground working out a reciprocal sales agreement with bunker ramo a maker of microcomputerdriven teller terminals with strong sales in europe and the united states to gain access to the canadian atm market the company signed a sales and service agreement with phillips the international electronics company in  and  atm orders from banks sagged in pace with a general slowdown in bank equipment sales diebold had to cut back on costs but kept the research and development funds flowing toward finding additional applications for atm technology and aggressively sought out nonbank atm buyers in  national transactions systems ordered  cashdispensing machines to be placed in west coast eleven and safeway stores in  diebold announced  new products these included selfserve video rental machines credit cardactivated gas station pumps and interactive video systems to be used for dispensing tickets and information for banks that wanted lowercost cash networks they also came out with automatic teller machines that were smaller and performed fewer operations such as dispensing cash but not taking deposits s saw partnership between diebold and ibm and several new ventures in july  diebold the company that professed to having nightmares about ibm a decade earlier announced a joint venture with its erstwhile competitor which was dubbed interbold at the time diebold held a larger proportion of the domestic and world atm markets than ibm but the venture was designed to make the most of each parent companys expertise diebold owned the majority share of the partnership at  percent through interbold diebold benefited from ibms strengths in software development and systems integration as well as from the companys strong position in europe asia and latin america within a year of the venture interbold introduced the i series atm the first atm model to use imagelift technology imagelift allowed atm users to see a picture of deposited checks on the atm screen and addressed customers fears about trusting deposits to the machines by  interbold had the only networked atms in poland and held the leading position in mexico where the banking industry was in the process of privatization the following year diebold formed a joint venture to manufacture and support atms in china as the s continued diebold made additional moves to enter or expand in such markets as mexico venezuela india and russia these overseas moves helped to more than double diebolds foreign sales during the first several years of the s with  percent of net sales coming from outside the united states by  also during the s retail and other applications for cardactivated transaction equipment continued to multiply diebold moved aggressively to leverage its atm expertise into new applications which company ceo and chairman robert mahoney hoped would keep the company growing rapidly even as the market for atms began to mature interbold developed a multimedia dispenser capable of selfservice distribution of postage stamps airline tickets travelers checks food stamps and public transportation passes among other items in  diebold formed a joint venture with nelson vending technology limited of toronto to distribute automated videocassette vending systems to convenience stores drugstores apartment complexes business centers hotels hospitals and other commercial centers in mid diebold introduced an integrated campus access management icam system which enabled students to use a single card to gain access to various campus buildings and to pay for meals books and vending machine items as well as to get cash from an atm by the end of   colleges and universities had signed up for icam including texas am florida state and the university of illinois this system was designed not only for college campuses but also for any other campuslike setting such as hospitals amusement parks and prisons by  icam was making inroads into the primary and secondary school markets in december of that year diebold bolstered its position through the  million acquisition of griffin technology incorporated a farmington new yorkbased company with revenue of  million that had installed its own card system on  college campuses diebold had installed about  systems by this time in yet another new venture diebold through its nascent medselect systems division introduced an automated drug dispensing system in late  the system allowed healthcare institutions to manage their supplies of pharmaceuticals and other supplies as well as to automatically bill patients as drugs and supplies are used in the mids diebold also participated in leadingedge testing of socalled smart cards through its advanced card systems division in  the company partnered with first union corporation to test a system whereby fans at jacksonville jaguars national football league games purchased cards that they used to buy concessions and other stadium items with each purchase the transaction amount is automatically deducted from the current value of the card the next year diebold and first union again teamed for the largest smart card test program yetat the  summer olympics in atlanta from a consumer standpoint smart cards were touted as a convenient way for people to pay for small items reducing the amount of cash they have to carry although the future of smart cards remained in doubt diebolds participation in their development showed the companys commitment to staying on the cutting edge with demand for atms continuing to grow diebold faced a lengthy production backlog in  leading to its  addition of three new us manufacturing facilities in staunton and danville virginia and in lexington north carolina the company also expanded and upgraded its existing us plants in canton and sumter south carolina diebold continued to operate other manufacturing facilities in germany china india and the united states although diebolds share of the us atm market had fallen from about  percent in  to about  percent in thanks in large part to new competitors most notably triton systems corp based in long beach mississippithe rapid growth in atms worldwide  percent in  alone provided an environment for healthy growth and profitability diebolds net sales more than doubled from  to  from  million to  billion while net income grew even faster increasing from  million in  to  million in  the company was growing so fast that in late  it was somewhat belatedly decided that the positions of president and coowhich mahoney had assumed two years earlier while remaining ceo and chairmanmdash⁄ould finally be given to someone else namely gregg a searle who had been an executive vicepresident diebolds managers felt confident enough about the companys ability to sell atms overseas that in july  they announced that the company intended to discontinue the interbold joint venture with ibm phasing it out over the following  months talks between diebold and ibm were soon underway over diebold buying ibms  percent interbold stake this bold move was indicative of a company filled with confidence about its future still the world leader in the farfrommature atm marketand with numerous overseas markets still only starting to develop atm networksdiebold could count on many more years of revenues and profits from its breadandbutter product line and it also was aggressively seeking out the blockbusters of tomorrow through its involvement with icams medical dispensing systems smart cards and also transaction software for the internet diebold could certainly face the new millennium
