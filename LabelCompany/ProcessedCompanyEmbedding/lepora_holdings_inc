formerly event hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september     basis of presentation   the summary of significant accounting policies presented below are designed to assist in understanding the companys unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements   certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december     note  – significant accounting policies   the following summary of significant accounting policies of the company is presented to assist in the understanding of the company’s financial statements the financial statements and notes are the representation of the company’s management who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity the financial statements of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   use of estimates   the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates   cash   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of september   and december   respectively            lepora holdings inc formerly event hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september     concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september     income taxes   under the accounting standards codification asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration   loss per common share   basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows             lepora holdings inc formerly event hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september     level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist principally of accrued liabilities payable to a related party pursuant to asc  and asc  “ financial instruments”  the fair value of our accrued liabilities to a related party is determined based on “level ” inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets   recent accounting pronouncements   in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  income statement extraordinary and unusual items subtopic  simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items the objective of this update is to simplify the income statement presentation requirements in subtopic  by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items extraordinary items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence eliminating the extraordinary classification simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration this accounting standards update is the final version of proposed accounting standards update  income statement extraordinary items subtopic  which has been deleted effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively a reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption the effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities management is in the process of assessing the impact of this asu on the companys financial statements   on april   fasb issued asu no  earnings per share topic  effects on historical earnings per units of master limited partnership dropdown transactions under topic  earnings per share master limited partnerships mlps apply the twoclass method to calculate earnings per unit epu because the general partner limited              lepora holdings inc formerly event hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september     partners and incentive distribution rights holders each participate differently in the distribution of available cash when a general partner transfers or drops down net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control the statements of operations of the master limited partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the entities were under common control the amendments in this update specify that for purposes of calculating historical epu under the twoclass method the earnings losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner interest and previously reported epu of the limited partners would not change as a result of a dropdown transaction qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings losses differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs also are required   this accounting standards update is the final version of proposed accounting standards update eitfa earnings per share effects on historical earnings per unit of master limited partnership dropdown transactions topic  which has been deleted effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is permitted the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented management is in the process of assessing the impact of this asu on the companys financial statements   on november   fasb issued asu income taxes  the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements current gaap requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard             lepora holdings inc formerly event hill acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september     the fasb issued asu  “ leases” topic   asu  requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for leases with a term of  months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities in transition lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal years beginning after december   ie january   for a calendar year entity and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december   early application is permitted for all nonpublic business entities upon issuance the company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the company’s financial position and results of operations   the company has implemented all accounting pronouncements that are in effect that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   note  – going concern   the company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating loss of  and  for the three months and nine months ended september   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of september   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its stockholders or debt financing or sale of its stock as may be required   the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity if the company is unable to acquire additional working capital it will be required to significantly change its business plans            lepora
