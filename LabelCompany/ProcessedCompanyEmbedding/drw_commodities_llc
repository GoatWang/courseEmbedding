manipulation defendants allegedly manipulated the idex usd threemonth interest rate swap futures contract by “banging the close” washington dc – the us commodity futures trading commission cftc today filed a civil enforcement action in the us district court for the southern district of new york against donald r wilson wilson and his company drw investments llc drw the cftc’s complaint charges wilson and drw with unlawfully manipulating and attempting to manipulate the price of a futures contract namely the idex usd threemonth interest rate swap futures contract threemonth contract from at least january  through august  the complaint alleges that as a result of the manipulative scheme the defendants profited by at least  million while their trading counterparties suffered losses of an equal amount according to the complaint in  the threemonth contract was listed by the international derivatives clearinghouse idch and traded on the nasdaq omx futures exchange and was publicized as an alternative to overthecounter ie offexchange products wilson and drw believed that they could trade the contract for a profit based on their analysis of the contract at the end of  wilson caused drw to acquire a large long fixed rate position in the threemonth contract with a net notional value in excess of  million the daily value of drw’s position was dependent upon the daily settlement price of the threemonth contract calculated according to idch’s methodology as wilson and drw knew the methodology relied on electronic bids placed on the exchange during a minute period the “settlement window” prior to the close of each trading day in the absence of such bids the exchange used prices from overthecounter markets to determine its settlement prices wilson and drw anticipated that the value of their position would rise over time the market prices did not reach the level that wilson and drw had hoped for and expected according to the complaint rather than accept that reality wilson and drw allegedly executed a manipulative strategy to move the threemonth contract market price in their favor by “banging the close” which entailed placing numerous bids on many trading days almost entirely within the settlement window none of which resulted in actual transactions as drw regularly cancelled the bids under the exchange’s methodology drw’s bids became the settlement prices and in this way drw unlawfully increased the value of its position according to the complaint gretchen l lowe the cftc’s acting director of enforcement stated “traders cannot engage in manipulative acts to affect the price of futures contracts to achieve their desired profits regardless of the socalled motive today’s action demonstrates that the commission will vigorously prosecute such cases to protect the integrity of the markets” according to the complaint wilson and drw allegedly caused and profited from artificial prices on the threemonth contract over a period of at least  trading days because wilson and drw allegedly caused artificial prices in multiple maturities of the threemonth contract each day the manipulative scheme allegedly affected the prices of over  futures contracts according to the complaint the complaint alleges that by engaging in such conduct wilson violated or aided and abetted in the violation of sections c and a of the commodity exchange act cea  usc §§  and a   supp iv the complaint further alleges that pursuant to section b of the act  usc § cb   supp iv wilson is liable as a controlling person for drw’s violations of sections c and a of the cea the complaint charges drw with vicarious liability for the violations of its agents andor employees including wilson pursuant to section ab of the act  usc § ab   supp iv in its ongoing litigation the cftc is seeking permanent injunctive relief disgorgement restitution civil monetary penalties trading suspensions and bans and payment of costs and fees the following
