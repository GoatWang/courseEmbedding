kent f richards belongs not to the richards family alone but to families everywhere who are striving to live after the manner of happiness and to pass their legacy of faith to the next generation arranged chronologically excerpts from the journals of these three faithful men—willard franklin d and george f richards—offer us a privileged view of their daytoday lives we see their service in the church marriage and family concerns and opportunities for growth as each worked to build up the kingdom of god on the earth we see their faith and the commitment to the gospel expressed in the details of their lives—willards grief at the death of the prophet joseph smith whose murder he witnessed in  franklins pain at being apart from his wife jane who was then journeying west across the plains and whose companionship would have been a strength to him as he served in the presidency of the british mission and decades later georges joy in being reunited with his wife and children after his own service in presiding over the british mission during world war i a family of faith offers us a uniquely personal view of more than a century of church history as those events were witnessed and
