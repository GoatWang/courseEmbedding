right on time and on budget beverly m seattle wa they were very professional and kind when the weather permitted they got their work done terry w auburn wa they did great work at a great price they

job went extremely well and i highly recommend coddington constructioni was fortunate to have ken the owner provide the initial consultation and bid he was very patient and helped me understand all the details and considerations after having met with about  different contractors ken won my business handsdown with his helpfulness and professionalism even when we ran into a few very minor challenges during the project ken was friendly and patientid read in the reviews that people were very happy with mark and michelles team so i asked if i could have them do the job and they were also great very friendly respectful and took into account every detail of the work that was planned and made adjustments as necessary it was a pleasure saying hello to mark michelle brandon and noah each day and we actually kind of missed them when the job was donethe original consultation was april deposit was made on may  to commit to the workwe had some waiting time due to ordering the color plus hardie material  i decided to go with a higher end window totally worth it which needed to be special ordered aligning with the teams schedule of projectsoriginal estimate was that work may begin nd week of june but the above resulted in us starting work end of june this was not a problem for us the project was estimated to take  weeks to complete plus additional few days for painters in reality it was about  weeks to complete construction but we had a delay after the first  weeks due to running out of some of the siding material and they needed to come back for a few days this ended up moving us back about  weeks while waiting for material and possibly for the team to have a break between jobs again with the team completing the final bit of construction middle of august the painters came maybe a couple of weeks later to do the trimwe then needed to wait one last time due to schedule alignment for the teams to get the interior of the windows painted i think that most people are ordering vinyl or fiberglass windows these days i can actually empathize that it must have been a big pain to need to come and paint wood windowsthe project did take longer than anticipated from starttofinish but i am realistic enough to know that ideal timelines are rarely achievable due to practicalities ken never left us in a situation where our home was in any kind of disarray the team cleaned up the entire site every day so that there was not an accumulation of debris and when they were finished it was spotless they got the windows installed quickly and took great care to make sure the home was well sealed from the elements during that process and when we did have the delay it was at a point in the project where the impact on us was basically zeromost importantly the quality of this work was extremely high the workers and the business were conscientious ken was very accommodating in coordinating details and communications were timelyif i had it to do over again i would make the exact same choice that i made donald c kent wa coddington construction did an excellent job on replacing the siding on our house it looks better now than it did when it was brand new richard s tacoma wa this was a major investment for us and we could not be happier with the results i would recommend this company very highly steve b renton wa mark michelle and noah were an outstanding team courteous always made sure they were doing what we wanted we didnt have a straightforward house to reside great craftsmanship and always left the outside in great shape at the end of each work day bill c seattle wa very professional excellent work fair price this kind of work new siding painting is frequently delayed by the weather but they stayed on task until the job was done james t tacoma wa during the entire project coddington construction provided superior quality workmanship and staff that helped us make home improvements always courteous when we would come home from work our house and yard would be cleaned up daily from the project and we never felt that we were living and hindered in a construction zone you could tell from the moment the crew arrived and the way they conducted themselves that we never had to worry being given low grade low quality craftsmanship the house now looks awesome and is very curb appealing david c redmond wa coddington did an excellent job all around of getting our project completed as we liked chris p seattle wa our house had two layers of siding on it the top layer being yellow vinyl siding visually the siding detracted from the overall look of the house ken and the team did a great job making recommendations that really enhanced the overall look of our new siding they suggested adding some decorative shingles and narrowing the reveal of the siding that really made the house look great our neighbors comment on how great the house looks all the time trudy w renton wa they worked quickly and neatly without sacrificing the quality the crew acted like they were working on their own house with great attention to detail precise workmanship cleaning up all construction debris daily the crew was friendly and eager to respond to all of my questions and requests the painters were also efficient and did a precise job i couldnt be happier with the results i feel like im living in a brand new house john d bellevue wa quality quality quality the best construction experience ive ever had starting with the professionalism of the construction team to the finished product the workmanship and professionalism was outstanding it was pretty complicated because we had our house completely resided many windows replaced new garage doors new front door installed with trim some skylights replaced gutters installed and had the whole house repainted the results are stellar david p des moines wa working with ken and his team was great they always responded quickly to my questions and any concerns the end result looks great and is exactly what i had envisioned they were always reliable and timely gary h auburn wa coddington construction prepared a fair bid for new siding on my house the crew did a good job and cleaned up as they went one corner on the house did not look as good as the others but it was fixed right away after i pointed it out to the company owner on the final walkthru customer reviews provided by hardie
