recently learned of a scam on google hangouts  the scammer is fraudulently posting a job opening freelance graphic designer with graphic packaging international inc “gpi” using the name “kim beard” as the primary contact  as part of the ruse the scammer is sending fake employment offers to various people using the email address hrgraphicpkagcom or another fraudulent email address that has no association with gpi  if the ruse continues the scammer sends the person a check with instructions to use the funds to purchase office equipment  when the purchase cannot be completed the scammer then instructs the target to use his or her own funds to purchase gift cards and send them to the scammer this is not a valid employment offer gpi does not solicit jobs via google hangouts the only way to
