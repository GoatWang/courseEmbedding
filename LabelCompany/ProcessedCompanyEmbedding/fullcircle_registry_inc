within the meaning of � attracting immediate financing � merging with or acquiring profitable private businesses � delivering a quality product that meets customer expectations � obtaining and expanding market acceptance of the products we offer and � competition in our market history our initial business began in  with the formation of fullcircle registry inc fullcircle or the company we were a technologybased business that provided emergency document and information retrieval services the system was designed to allow medical personnel to quickly obtain critical information we provided these services directly to subscribers and through strategic alliances with health care providers our current business our current business plan targets the acquisition of small profitable businesses with the following mission statement fullcircle registry incs mission is to provide exit capabilities for small to medium sized private profitable companies through acquisition to improve our stockholder value while leaving those companies autonomous where possible to continue to be managed by the team that founded them and subsequently providing liquidity and increased returns for the founders we have entered the analysis and selection phase of our ma activities and will be announcing any progress through pr newswire releases new business plan and new direction in recent years we have established four operating subsidiaries in addition to the parent company fullcircle registry inc we have established companies to operate in the following business sectors distribution of medical supplies entertainment insurance agency and prescription assistance services in  we purchased our first property in indianapolis indiana that contains the georgetown  digital cinemas revenues for     and  were predominantly from the movie theater operations our medical supplies distribution company fullcircle medical supplies inc plans to commence operations in  when funding is available fullcircle insurance agency inc and fullcircle prescriptions inc are currently inactive pending national economic improvements and changes in the healthcare sector funding for acquisitions theater improvements and operating capital in july  we entered into discussions with local initiatives support corporation lisc for the purpose of receiving funding assistance for the business model change of our theater in indianapolis additional information regarding those activities is reported under new direction business model for georgetown  cinemas below we continue to receive additional requirements to qualify for consideration of funding from lisc we have accomplished all of those demands and are in the final stages of revising the application and pro formas to include those revisions we have been informed that our application should proceed to the lisc committee in june for its recommendation to lisc corporate offices this has been a very difficult process as there has been no assistance on how to proceed with the application process there are specialists that perform these functions for companies however fullcircle does not have sufficient capital to hire these services so our ceo has had to perform these application revisions himself along with the tax appeal process sec filings and the general management of the company our ceo met with our property mortgage holder and was able to obtain a mortgage payment moratorium until july   when it is expected that our lisc funding application will be resolved it is our intent to lease the theater once the funding and theater conversion is completed fullcircle entertainment inc in  we established fullcircle entertainment inc fullcircle entertainment for the purpose of acquiring movie theaters and other entertainment venues on december   fullcircle entertainment purchased georgetown  cinemas a movie theater complex property at  lafayette road indianapolis indiana  a summary of the georgetown  acquisition follows � the acre property purchase price was  million � the appraised value was  million � assumed mortgage was  with issuance of company stock valued at  �  employees in january  we converted all of our screens to a digital format and installed d capability at a cost of  which we financed with a secured loan the digital format offers a crisper view and allows the exhibition of d movies on three of our screens two of our theaters had been previously converted to digital prior to  in  we renegotiated the mortgage on the property resulting in a reduction of  percentage point in the interest rate in march  we again renegotiated the mortgage resulting in a further reduction of  percentage point our mortgage currently is currently at a    interest rate due to the decline in movie revenues and related decline in operating cash flows in  it was difficult for us to maintain the current level of principal and interest payments on july   we entered into a change in terms agreement with our lender whereby our lender agreed to modify our payment schedule from a monthly fixed principal and interest payment in the amount of  to interest only payments beginning with payment due date of june   thru november   the normal payment of principal and interest of  was to resume on december   in late  the mortgage on our property was transferred to another lender and recently we have negotiated a mortgage payment moratorium until july   expecting that our funding application with lisc will be resolved by then during  we increased pricing of our tickets and concessions to be in line with other competing full service digital theaters in our area we also developed a new web page for the georgetown  digital cinemas allowing for a more complete patron information center the new site is in  we began an upgrade to the georgetown  digital cinemas with more signage and a complete remodel of our concession and lobby areas as well as new employee uniforms funding for these improvements has been difficult but we have managed to begin the process with the assistance from major stockholders we launched a gift card program as well as a customer rewards program since its inception in january  more than  patrons have enrolled in the customer rewards program this will allow us to identify the zip codes of our patrons so that we can target specialized marketing materials and monitor our growth outside our immediate area we also added uniformed security from dusk to close and increased our management compensation to be more commensurate with other local theaters we also improved our maintenance operations to improve the patron experience during  contingent on our funding application we plan to improve our theater operations to allow us to offer � free viewing of us popular sporting events such as the major league baseball world series nfl playoffs ncaa basketball and football playoffs and nba playoffs these would be primarily marketing events to increase concession revenue � viewing of popular international sporting events to serve our local international community � business meetings requiring highspeed internet upload and download capabilities � private party functions � adult beverages and intheater dining � new recliner seating during  nationwide theater revenues were down compared to the preceding year due principally to a series of poorly reviewed and disappointing movies that were released because of the first run movies that are predominately class b movies we experienced a further decline in attendance our first quarter ticket sales and concession revenues dropped by  compared to the first quarter  the quality of the movies during the quarter has been disappointing however the industry as a whole is expecting some improved releases in june and july in early  we received a letter of intent for the purpose of leasing our georgetown  theater we negotiated and accepted reasonable terms of a lease and after six months the company vacated the loi their broker informed us that they were unable to obtain the funds necessary for their planned  million conversion of the theater in october  we once again returned to seeking a theater company to lease or purchase our property those conversations continued throughout  and remain active at the time of this filing we continue to discuss leasing opportunities with major theater companies several have visited but have declined due to the high crime image in our area next to the lafayette square mall which is predominately vacant and in disrepair provided that we are successful in acquiring funding and completing the conversion into a dinein theater we believe that we will become attractive to a major movie theater company for the purpose of leasing our remodeled facility no assurances can be made as to the success of our plan to lease or sell the property however we have paid down our mortgage by approximately  since the acquisition of the property in  so should this occur we would be in a better financial position to be able to refinance our mortgage and be able to use some of our equity for working capital at this time we have no contracts agreements or understandings for additional funding nor can any assurance be given that we will be able to obtain this capital on acceptable terms in such an event this may have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the total capital necessary to fund our new business plans in such an event this may have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition a portion of the building housing the georgetown digital cinemas also includes a grocery store space which we lease to an independent operator in  we renewed our lease to savealot stores a grocery store operator for another seven years with three five year options our theater general manager elected to retire and relocate to idaho during the march quarter currently the theater and property is being managed by the fullcircle ceo and we are reviewing candidates to hire a new general manager recently we received notification that our appeal for the property tax assessment was approved this appeal reduced our annual property tax payments by  to  for the  assessment year we received a new assessment for  that did not take into consideration our  assessment adjustment so we have started the appeal process again working on these appeals for each year since  is extremely time consuming and frustrating due to the degree of difficulty working with a bureaucracy requires engaging an experienced tax attorney given that there is insufficient funding to hire those services the ceo has been required to perform all of those appeals since  the savings has been substantial with approximately  in tax savings with the  appeal remaining new direction business model for georgetown  cinemas the cost of renting movies from studios and filmmakers continues to increase in addition the quantity of major new releases each week has declined in general we do not receive the best first run movies anymore on the other hand the casual restaurant business has been on the upswing in recent years and consumer demand for restaurant meals has increased because of these trends we have been attempting to refinance the theater or acquire other funding to finance the conversion of the theater into an intheater dining experience and replace the stadium seating with recliner lounge seating as a result of changes in hollywoods direction and the popularity of netflix and other movie aftermarket activity the theater business model is changing and many theater companies are starting to convert to enhanced food and beverage services in addition many theaters are transforming their auditoriums to luxury reclining seating fortunately as of this date only two theaters in our marketplace have converted studio movie grill converted a facility  miles from us to full indining services and circle center has converted to just luxury recliners we believe that we need to move quickly to protect our investment we believe we have an ideal theater footprint for us to do a complete conversion including a nice area for a lounge and a lobby large enough to install a food or beverage destination area as well the plan would be to convert the smallest auditorium into a kitchen in our phase one plans we would convert four auditoriums into luxury recliner seating and begin serving an expanded menu and beverages in phase two more theaters would be converted as well because of the improved performance in the casual restaurant sector in past years we believe that this trend will continue economically if a person and their spouse want to do a dinner and a movie it takes about four hours to do and if they have children the babysitting cost is very high combining the theater and the restaurant reduces the time to about two hours and becomes more economically attractive since october  we have been working with agencies that are involved in economic development in the depressed areas of indianapolis we have had two meetings with representatives of the mayor of indianapolis and a meeting with former mayor ballard on july th  the mayors office introduced us to local initiatives support corporation lisc which provides grants and financing for redevelopment of urban commercial properties and we are requesting a grant to provide the funding to convert the theater indianapolis has expressed interest in improving the georgetown  area and members of the citys economic development staff are assisting us in our campaign our applications for the conversion grant and the refinancing of the property have been submitted the area has been economically damaged by the problems with the lafayette square mall adjacent to us along with the recession currently lafayette square mall is less than  occupied lisc is interested in helping the area to improve the business climate and begin a recovery another mall area lafayette shoppes which is adjacent to our property has also experienced a decline in tenants currently that centers shops are only  occupied among other activities we have been engaged in a property tax appeal since may  to correct our valuations back to  in late august we made a presentation to the tax review board of marion county for the purpose of evaluation of our historical assessments and taxes on the theater property we won this appeal and we have received credits of  dating back to the assessments in  we have engaged in a payment plan to clear the remaining property tax balance in monthly payments of  per month through june of  we are still in the process of appealing the  and  assessments since we have resolved the valuation and tax issues we became cleared to submit our lisc application all of the required information financial history and pro formas along with details of the five phases of our plan have been submitted to lisc if we receive a favorable response from lisc it is our goal that lisc would provide the funding for the theater conversion and upgrade we are requesting funds sufficient to complete the conversion of half the theater our pro forma with the conversion is estimated to take our fullcircle entertainment revenues to the  to  million level in the first year after conversion which would be more than double our current revenue performances of other existing theaters that have made this conversion have had even greater percentages increases of course these pro forma estimates depend on a number of assumptions no assurances can be made at this time as to the success of our plan to acquire the funding and lease or sell the property subsequent to december   on february   we received a letter of intent loi for the purpose of purchasing a portion of our parking lot the loi purpose is to use the south end of the parking lot for a mixeduse building housing retail shops and millennium apartments at this time the developer is engaged in a feasibility study if this purchase for the development moves forward it will provide some working capital as well as improve the value of our remaining property the area being discussed is about one acre in size recently on may nd we received a support letter from the director of the international marketplace coalition which was one of the requirements from lisc for us to complete our application requirements this allows us to now proceed to committee action for our funding application fullcircle medical supplies inc in  we established a new company fullcircle medical supplies inc fullcircle medical for the purpose of entering into the durable medical equipment dme supply business sector for the purpose of acquiring medical supply businesses and other related medical supply services in the sun belt states at the time we started to move into the dme acquisition direction we believed that the theater would be leased out which would free up our time and financial resources to begin that project unfortunately this company development had to be placed on hold until we can get out from under the financial burden of the theater our current plan is to acquire or establish dme businesses throughout the state of louisiana with up to twelve dme locations utilizing centralized warehousing billing and purchasing and to provide all related dme services in each location acquiring these businesses and covering the whole state should provide � economies of scale reducing costs of inventory and operational expenses � central warehousing providing prompt supply to all stores and internet sales and reducing obsolete inventory writedowns � smaller vehicle fleets � improved buying power by purchasing in volume � reduced insurance expense � improved individual store web sites � internet marketing allowing the stores to reach out to the entire country with product catalogues and shopping carts � social media marketing � centralized billing and insurance claim processing � improved receivables controls � increased selection of products � operational synergies between all stores � improved margins and profitability once we can begin we are considering several existing dme businesses with an average of approximately  million in revenues at such time as we complete some acquisitions we plan to employ a state manager with experience in the medical supply industry to supervise the managers of the purchased stores and to manage the operations in the state we have signed consulting agreements with two acquisition managers for the purpose of assisting in our acquisition process in louisiana and south carolina and to assist the ceo in the due diligence requirements necessary to determine each dmes suitability to become part of our mission many of these businesses are still owned by their founders who are looking for an exit strategy to realize a gain for their lifes work most have employees with ten to fifteen years experience who are solid contributors to these businesses most are contributors to civic activities in their communities which provides them a business connection within their marketing area our intent is to allow them to continue to operate autonomously to continue to be profitable and to improve net income with increased product selection improved synergies and internet and social media exposure we have entered the analysis and selection phase of our acquisition activities and our executives have made multiple trips to louisiana for the purpose of collecting and analyzing information reviewing each business observing employees and understanding the focus and strengths of each business in some cases we are negotiating letters of intent for these proposed acquisitions and in the process of financial evaluations of those businesses typically most dme businesses do not market on the internet and many do not have websites once we complete the first acquisition we plan to create a web site introducing a products catalogue and shopping cart as acquisitions continue we plan to clone the website for each location connecting to our products catalogue and shopping carts this would allow each dme to market nationally as well as internationally and ship out of a central warehouse we believe that revenues from these businesses can be expanded by approximately  over the first twoyear period through internet and social media marketing in general applicable sec rules require that the financial statements of these businesses be audited by an independent certified public accountant so the purchase of these businesses cannot be completed until the auditors complete the audit and provide their opinion candidates to operate the proposed louisiana company have been interviewed and following acquisition of dme companies in the state will be phased in with consulting arrangements and eventually assume management positions in the company we believe our consultants will assist in providing a full range of products and services for each market once we establish consolidated operations in louisiana and the infrastructure and operations are tested and functioning we plan to utilize this same rollup approach in additional southern states fullcircle insurance agency inc the fullcircle insurance agency inc was founded in august  but is currently inactive in the past few years the insurance industry has experienced difficulties flowing from the financial problems of aig and other major industry players and the enactment of the affordable care act has produced significant uncertainty in the healthcare insurance field until these matters are stabilized we have placed operations of this company on hold we believe that this industry will thrive once the affordable care act is fully implemented improved and finalized increased agency knowledge and professionalism will be necessary to help businesses and individuals understand the new laws we believe there are opportunities to roll up several local agencies into regional agencies for economies of scale in providing these professional services fullcircle prescription services inc fullcircle prescription services inc was established for the purpose of handling our prescription assistance services program its mission is to assist consumers in finding medications at discounted rates worldwide in our shop the world program when it becomes operational fullcircle prescription services inc will not dispense any medications nor handle any prescriptions but will function only as a customer assistance program until a more favorable political climate exists we have placed the marketing efforts for the advancement of fullcircle prescription services inc on hold our corporate information our principal executive offices are located at  alpine drive shelbyville kentucky  and our telephone number is   our current website address is wwwfullcircleregistrycom our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report sec compliance and regulations the requirements for regulatory compliance continue to be difficult the html and the xbrl filing format are now both required by the sec which is expensive competition movie theater entertainment the motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive our theaters compete against regional and independent operators as well as the larger theatre circuit operators our operations are subject to varying degrees of competition with respect to film licensing attracting customers and obtaining new theater sites in those areas where real estate is readily available there are few barriers preventing competing companies from opening theaters near our existing theater which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues demographic changes and    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage stock market’s biggest risk is a ‘flash crash’ says ‘flash
