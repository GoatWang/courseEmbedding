studied as a treatment for off periods in people with parkinson’s disease taking an oral carbidopa  levodopa regimen off periods refer to the reemergence of parkinson’s symptoms “we are greatly encouraged by the efficacy and safety results of this trial which validate the positive phase b results” said burkhard blank md chief medical officer of acorda “we would like to express our gratitude

freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
