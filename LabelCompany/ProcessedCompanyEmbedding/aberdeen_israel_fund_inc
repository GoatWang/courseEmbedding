reputation for geopolitical instability we believe its conflicts don’t diminish the investment potential in this region however as neither an emerging market nor a developed nation it can offer investors the best of both worlds the aberdeen israel fund inc isl takes the confusion out of israel’s seemingly complex socioeconomic issues by focusing on its inherent strengths and thriving industries israel’s military is leading a technology battle israel is a startup nation the same military it relies on for national security is also driving growth in its technology sector the israeli government spends more than twice as much of its gross domestic product gdp on research and development rd compared to the nations of the european union and that often trickles down to the private sector for this reason israel is a hotbed for technology startups and talent it’s no secret that israel is the world’s leading provider of firewall technology an essential part of every corporation’s it infrastructure another overlooked truth is that israel is a developed nation with controlled growth which investors may wrongly perceive as “slow” but with an international monetary fund imf projection of  gdp through  israel is on track to exceed the growth of the us and far surpass most european countries because of the nation’s strong central bank and conservative spending its public debt is low compared to its peers in our view the outlook for israel over the mediumtolong term is positive as a center of research and development excellence foreign investment in israel continues to be strong and the country’s young population and wage growth are expected to help increase consumption for years to come outside of technology the nation also continues to see growth in
