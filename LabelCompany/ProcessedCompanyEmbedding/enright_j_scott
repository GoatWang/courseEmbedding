mint with its rapidly approaching transition from british to communist chinese rule the future of hong kong has been a frequent story for news reporters in both the east and the west but the july st transfer of power has been seen mostly as a political event with virtually no analysis of the economic future of one of the worlds most important business centers now in the hong kong advantage readers have the conclusions of a yearlong study of the competitiveness of hong kong in a volume that sheds light on both the colonys profitable past and its prospects in coming years enright scott and dodwell highlight a number of reasons for the colonys prosperityits unique intermingling of thousands of local and overseas firms the handsoff policy of the colonial government a singular blend of firms with steady cash flow transportation property or utilities and firms relying on flexibility rapid response and competitive pricing clothing toys electronics and its central location in the most dynamic economic region in the world but the greatest reason for its success has been its metamorphosis into an information and knowledgebased economy acting in particular as a metropolitan center for mainland china combining the land labor and resources of the interior with the design marketing and logistics skills found in hong kong the authors contend that this engine of prosperity should continueand indeed grow strongerafter the transfer of power hong kongs most pressing challenges the book concludes are problems generated by its own success such as its highcost economy with rising rents wages and compensation packages and the growing need for more highly skilled workers if its business leaders can cope with these problems the authors conclude hong kongs economic future should be as successful as its past the hong kong advantage is a book that everyone concerned about hong kongs economic futureand indeed the economic future of asia and the worldwill want to read  pages
