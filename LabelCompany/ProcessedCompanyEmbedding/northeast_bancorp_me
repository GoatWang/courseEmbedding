per share payable on february   to shareholders of record at the close of business on january   the company also announced that earnings for the six months ended december   were  or  per diluted share compared to  or  for the same period last year these results were in line with managements expectations as the company recently increased overhead via the opening of a commercial banking center in portland yields on earning assets and cost of funds have followed the general decline in interest rates resulting from the federal reserve cutting shortterm interest rates during the past year the pace of reducing the cost of funds has exceeded the decline in yields improving net interest income and net interest margin noninterest income increased from higher gains on the sales of residential real estate loans investment and insurance commissions cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and gains on the sale of investment securities noninterest expense also increased due to additional staff to support higher loan volume and new business initiatives in insurance and commercial loan brokerage new leased commercial business branch in portland and the relocation of northeast financial services investment division to new leased office in falmouth amortization of intangibles recognized in the acquisition of kendall insurance the northeast financial services insurance division and increased expenses accrued for the liquidation of acquired assets and volume related outsourced transaction costs based upon the continued growth and development of the investment division the company has expanded its available space in falmouth maine and added additional staff the company indicated that it fully expects that this investment in overhead will result in long term

commercial banking center in portland maine the states largest city in addition as part of the expansion into the portland market northeast announced the creation of a new commercial mortgage brokerage division that will work with the commercial loan division the brokerage division will allow the company to access a wide range of national and local lenders thereby enhancing the companys ability to successfully secure financing for each commercial relationship the results for the quarter ended december   reflect increased expenses incurred in connection with these efforts including an increase in net occupancy expenses associated with the development of new offices additional compensation and benefit expenses for the commercial mortgage brokerage division staff and the costs associated with supporting higher commercial and mortgage loan production the company continues to maintain an asset sensitive interest rate risk position which is designed to protect the institution

results we fully expect that our growth plan will add to our overall capacity to increase earnings particularly through the ability to deliver multiple financial products and services to each and

assist us in attracting new business as a result of our high level of product and service diversity we have opened offices at  middle street a prime location in downtown portland which has with driveup facility and easy access we are optimistic that this investment in the portland market will be offset by growth in revenue over the long term we dont expect to see any meaningful impact on earnings until the  th quarter since it typically takes some lead time to close new loans and to transfer accounts to date since the november opening we are very pleased with the markets response to this new and exciting location and the level of publicity the expansion has brought us this in turn has increased the visibility of our entire company northeast bancorp is the holding company for
