lending club for realestate so you can get richer faster exclusive  venturebeat  business  by rebecca grant business groundfloor unveils lending club for realestate so you can get richer faster exclusive rebecca grant may    pm groundfloor wants to take power away from banks and put it in the hands of the people the startup is building a peertopeer platform that gives regular people opportunities to invest in real estate projects it is emerging out of stealth mode today and opening up to private beta founder brian dally describes it as a ‘lending club for realestate” lending club is an online community that connects people who need to borrow money with people to lend it to them instead of going to a bank it is on track to originate  billion in loans this year and dally saw an opportunity to apply the same online model to larger asset classes real estate is a  trillion market and groundfloor wants to help people of all wealth classes get their ‘financial dessert’ hence the bakingapie picture above “if you are a big rich private equity investor you can loan money to real estate projects and receive a high rate of interest and when the project cashes out you get to share the upside of that” he said in an exclusive interview with venturebeat “this plays a role in the wealth disparity in this country — its part of the reason why the rich get richer they can make investments in larger assets for higher returns we want to give the average person the same chance” real estate projects require a large amount of money to get off the ground ordinarily a developer will borrow money from a bank and seek out wealthy investors to bankroll the project the developers then pay the money back with a high rate of interest and the investors get a share of the profits groundfloor crowd sources this investment by allowing anyone to contribute money even as little as  to a project and receive higher interest than they would through lowyield savings accounts k plans cd’s etc…developers can use groundfloor to avoid dealing with bank requirements and jumping through hoops “nobody likes banks” dally said “they are driven by centuries of inertia and regulatory infrastructure banks behave the way they do because they have all this power and can do what they want but the web is changing all that it adds a layer of democracy and transparency in way that banks just can’t and consumers are responding with their wallets people are showing that they want alternative ways to use and grow their money” many of those regulations are in place to safeguard investors from fraud and provide some insurance that they will be repaid groundfloor will address concerns over trust and security by running extensive background checks on every developer and verifying that they have the experience necessary to execute the first project is for a multitenant building of lofts in a college town the developer has  years of experience and has completed over  projects dally said once they see how this first campaign goes they have a range of other projects queued up groundfloor will make money from the borrowers who will pay to use the platform for putting their offering together market it and manage repayment dally previously worked at republic wireless a company that challenged traditional wireless carriers with with “hybrid calling” that offered nocontract talk text and web access for just  a month his cofounder nick bhargava founded crowd funding motaavi and played a significant role in getting the jobs act signed the two wanted to build a company together that would take power away from incumbents who weren’t using it well and give it to the “average joe” groundfloor is bootstrapped and based in raleigh north carolina photo credit freshwaterflickr vb

advantage of these improvements and those to come our team thrives on customer feedbackpositive and constructive alike feel free to comment here or email us at foundersgroundfloorus and we’ll be sure to respond and pass it alongall the bestbrian  nickgroundfloor cofounders resolution of our loan for  brooks st ne june   groundfloor aims to offer investors a full spectrum of risk adjusted returns from  to almost  as basic finance theory instructs investment returns should increase as the risk of a given investment increases this post illustrates the risk and the results of investing at the upper end of the yield spectrum by describing the performance of the loan on  brooks st ne in washington dc priced to yield in excess of  we are now reporting that we expect this loan to experience a significant principal loss this is just our second loss out of over  loans repaid since we began lending over three years ago while some losses are to be expected in any portfolio we think losses are opportunities for selfexamination on the part of our lending team as well as our community of investors who build portfolios of loans with us this loss which is expected to total  will upon realization represent a  reduction in our overall portfolio performance since inceptionwe know most startups in the real estate crowdfunding market have shied away from this kind of transparency not at groundfloor we are still the first and only issuer of a direct real estate debt security that is publicly regulated by the securities  exchange commission public filings are available here and the only one that is open to the nonaccredited  of us investors we submit to a higher standard of public disclosure when something goes wrong we go beyond what were required to disclose to share the details behind the numbers presented in our monthly performance filingsthe loangroundfloor’s  loan for  brooks st ne was originated on january   to finance the ongoing renovation and expansion of a singlefamily house it is subordinate to a first mortgage loan from f  n enterprises llc the  first mortgage loan closed on january   to fund acquisition and renovation of the property repayment was expected through a sale of the property upon completion of constructiongroundfloor’s  was comprised of the following elementssettlement charges borrower cash out renovation escrow the total project capitalization  consisted ofborrower equity  first mortgage  groundfloor mortgage  the  estimated after repair value arv yielded an estimated leverage of  loantocost ltc and  loantovalue ltv given the extremely high ltc the loan was considered very high risk and was accordingly rated “f” on groundfloor’s “a – g” scale  the speculative nature of the loan was reflected in the  interest rateour asset management actions to prevent lossover the course of the project groundfloor disbursed  draws totaling  leaving a balance of  in escrow we subsequently received notice that the borrower had encountered problems with structural systems and related permitting groundfloor promptly terminated further draw disbursements met with the borrower and inspected the property subsequently the borrower defaulted on the first mortgage groundfloor consulted local washington dc counsel to advise on various workout options and strategies to engage the first lien holder in a cooperative resolution groundfloor and the first lien holder engaged in negotiations to structure a resolution that could yield the maximum recovery valuation information obtained by groundfloor as well as the first mortgage holder indicate there is insufficient value in the property to pay off both loans in full in fact there is insufficient value to satisfy the first mortgage holder’s full legal balance given the senior lien holder has first claim on the collateral until a full payoff is realized it is clear groundfloor has virtually no negotiating leverageultimately the lenders did not reach agreement and the first lien holder notified groundfloor this month of their intent to foreclose  the foreclosure is scheduled for june   groundfloor expects its second lien to be extinguished upon foreclosure by the first lien holder the remaining escrow funds which we held pending completion of the construction will be returned to investors net of our costs incurred to recover additional balancessummary and conclusionprojected loan performanceloan amount undrawn funds in escrow lip recovery expenses net recovery principal loss   groundfloor was aware of the risks in the transaction and priced the loan accordingly the risks were disclosed to investors nevertheless we continuously strive to utilize negative experiences to improve our product for example we decided last year well in advance of any problems with this loan to discontinue offerings of junior lien loans we hope to reintroduce them as we continue building loan volume a larger number of available loans facilitates greater diversification of investor loan portfolios it also makes concentration in higher risk offerings such as  brooks st less likelydespite this loss groundfloor continues to deliver an outstanding value for investors as the only path for nonaccredited and accredited investors alike to participate directly in loans backed by real estate we’re especially proud of the  annualized net return including this loss that we have generated for our investors on average through over  loans repaid to date thats the net rate of return overall  for all of our loans that have repaid so far assuming an equal amount of investment in every one how about second lien loans like  brooks weve made  other loans in junior lien position all of the others have already returned principal and interest in full this loan is the only second lien loan that did not that will be of little solace to investors who concentrated their investments with us in the one that didnt repay in full but investors who diversified by investing an equal amount in all  of our second lien loans earned a net annualized return of  on that group of loans taken together if theres a silver lining in this news that is it second lien loans as a group delivered  more yield than the overall portfolio thats a quantification of the reward for the additional riskwe appreciate the trust and faith of those who have been with us since the early days of our national expansion over  months ago and we look forward to growing and welcoming many more investors in the year ahead as always whether you invest with us yet or not we welcome your feedback critical commentary and suggestions about this loan or any other topic below in the comments or by email directly to me at richgroundfloorus or brian and nick at foundersgroundfloorus say hello to taxadvantaged real estate investing march   we recently announced the availability of one of our most frequently requested features the ability to invest in groundfloor loans via selfdirected individual retirement accounts “iras” that’s exciting for two reasonsreason  the impactfirst and foremost opening up investing with groundfloor via individual retirement accounts is an important milestone toward fulfilling our purpose merrill lynch and agewave recently found that onethird of americans have nothing set aside for retirement and another  have less than  you don’t have to be a financial advisor to know thats not enoughwhy don’t people have more it certainly isn’t for a lack of options many just don’t have the expertise to navigate public markets and don’t trust the intermediaries who would do it for them developing the discipline to save your money is hard but it’s even harder for those who feel that investing is too complex or that the system is rigged against themwe started groundfloor to solve those problems by taking private lending public our unique offering the only one of its kind in real estate to be qualified by the us securities  exchange commission allows everyone to invest directly in private loans with attractive returns for the first time ever with groundfloor you don’t need to be a wealthy accredited investor

compliance behind it there’s no fund manager taking a big chunk of your profits here our investors build their own portfolios we make that as simple and fast and profitable as possiblenow with the launch of our ira investing all of that goodness is available with the benefit of taxadvantaged retirement investing we hope that for millions of people this will be refreshing motivating and encouraging — enough to kick their retirement savings into high gear this also means we can start solving a critical societal problem together one doityourself retirement portfolio of private real

loans for  million over that first year two years later in just one month december capping off a momentous  we offered  loans for  million that’s over four times as much in one twelfth the timethis is important because we didn’t build groundfloor to funnel big dollar investments into meeting a funding goal for any particular loan but to enable investors to build welldiversified portfolios within a given asset class our product and our operations have always been designed with this end in mind and it’s workingsince increasing available loan volume we’ve seen the average investment per loan decrease to  from over  but the average total investment per investor increase to  per month we’ve cheered this development our original vision is well on its way to being realized the volume of loans we’re now offering is ready to support retirement investing with the bigger account balances and broader allocation that comes with ithow to take partthe administration of selfdirected retirement accounts is complex to help manage the process we’ve partnered with ira services trust company as our first supported custodian with  years of experience and the most advanced technology of all the alternatives we considered over the past year we trust them to provide a reliable backbone for administering our investors’ most important assetsstarting today we are gradually extending invitations

individual investors it can nail down over  returns for you get started for house flippers  real estate developers nail down a hard money loan with rates as low as  get my rate what the press has to say about groundfloor closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower through crowdfunding is what makes groundfloor innovative groundfloor is unusual in that its mission opens real estate investing to the general population…the investment is secured by the real property and there’s an aggressive prescreening process for developers groundfloor’s investors are regular americans who partner with developers on  to  real estate projects over a six month period investing on average  per project they earn between a  percent and  percent return on their investment within six to  months… investors run the gamut from retirees to professionals who want to invest in real estate part time unlike several other real estate crowdfunding platforms that require a minimum investment of  groundfloor asks for a minimum investment of only  typical groundfloor loans which carry interest rates varying between  and  percent return  percent annually on a sixtomonth term… real estate crowdfunding opens up the potential for achieving high riskadjusted yields that have traditionally remained the province of a very narrow sliver of privileged people… while most funds allow only “accredited” investors – those with at least  million net worth after their principal residence – a few like groundfloor have modeled their business on more recent federal rules that allow nonaccredited investors to play groundfloor fills a void for real estate entrepreneursthey provide shortterm highyield returns backed by real estate to entrepreneurs who are often ignored by traditional lenders developers…have embraced the opportunity they see it as a viable way to quickly raise cash for a project it was a nightmare working with banks costanzo said it was bureaucratic and tedious costanzo then reached out to groundfloor… groundfloor allows developers homebuilders and remodelers like costanzo to crowdfund money from online investors across the us — similar to how startups raise funds on kickstarter to manufacture new products within a couple of weeks costanzo a former wealth manager raised  from  investors through groundfloor…they just make it happen costanzo

funding from a bank and a credit union since i owned the property for less than  months i couldn’t even get a home equity line with my  credit score thankfully groundfloor arrived the project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was timely and much smoother than what i’ve experienced at large banks loan servicing and postclosing support were also responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any construction draws alex hillreal estate investor groundfloor makes investing in real estate a simple process with a minimum investment size of  per project it is easy for me to

estate developers nail down a hard money loan with rates as low as  get my rate what the press has to say about groundfloor closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower through crowdfunding is what makes groundfloor innovative groundfloor is unusual in that its mission opens real estate investing to the general population…the investment is secured by the real property and there’s an aggressive prescreening process for developers groundfloor’s investors are regular americans who partner with developers on  to  real estate projects over a six month period investing on average  per project they earn between a  percent and  percent return on their investment within six to  months… investors run the gamut from retirees to professionals who want to invest in real estate part time unlike several other real estate crowdfunding platforms that require a minimum investment of  groundfloor asks for a minimum investment of only  typical groundfloor loans which carry interest rates varying between  and  percent return  percent annually on a sixtomonth term… real estate crowdfunding opens up the potential for achieving high riskadjusted yields that have traditionally remained the province of a very narrow sliver of privileged people… while most funds allow only “accredited” investors – those with at least  million net worth after their principal residence – a few like groundfloor have modeled their business on more recent federal rules that allow nonaccredited investors to play groundfloor fills a void for real estate entrepreneursthey provide shortterm highyield returns backed by real estate to entrepreneurs who are often ignored by traditional lenders developers…have embraced the opportunity they see it as a viable way to quickly raise cash for a project it was a nightmare working with banks costanzo said it was bureaucratic and tedious costanzo then reached out to groundfloor… groundfloor allows developers homebuilders and remodelers like costanzo to crowdfund money from online investors across the us — similar to how startups raise funds on kickstarter to manufacture new products within a couple of weeks costanzo a former wealth manager raised  from  investors through groundfloor…they just make it happen costanzo said “it seems more efficient and faster than a bank previous next browse our current investment

to say nick borthreal estate investor i decided to invest in groundfloor because it gives me the ability to invest  make money in the rebounding housing market without the largescale capital requirements time requirement and managerial overhead of being a direct real estate investor and developer groundfloor allows you to take part with a relatively low cost of entry further i like being able to understand how the funds will be spent and who will be spending them… the return is attractive and the investment terms are short enough to where you don’t have to be without the liquidity for too long adam ailionreal estate developer my first groundfloor project which had  equity was denied funding from a bank and a credit union since i owned the property for less than  months i couldn’t even get a home equity line with my  credit score thankfully groundfloor arrived the project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was timely and much smoother than what i’ve experienced at large banks loan servicing and postclosing support were also responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any construction draws alex hillreal estate investor groundfloor makes investing in real estate a simple process with a minimum investment size of  per project it is easy for me to diversify my capital investment while being able to quickly filter through project options to find what best fits my strategy the process of investing through groundfloor has been very smooth and i look forward to enjoying continued investments and returns in the future i would definitely recommend the groundfloor platforms to anyone looking to invest in real estate assets or make a superior return on their capital steve brockreal estate developer groundfloor’s innovative approach to real estate financing is proving to be an effective way for us to keep pace with rising demand in our communities i was blown away by how quickly and easily we were able to fund a projectit took less than  hours on our first deal dan cooperreal estate investor i like having the ability to invest in real estate without having to make either a massive commitment to a single property or trust a vague portfolio
