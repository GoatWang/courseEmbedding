loans��you may choose to receive the cash surrender value in a lump sum or you will have available the same payout options as if it constituted a death benefit � for more information see full surrender beginning on page  and the payout options� beginning on page  � premium flexibility � you will not be required to make your premium payments according to a schedule��within limits you may vary the frequency and amount and you might even be able to skip needing to make a premium payment��for more information see premium beginning on page  � investment options � you may choose to allocate your premiums after charges to the fixed or variable investment options � ��� the fixed investment option will earn interest daily at an annual effective rate no less than the stated interest crediting rate on the policy data page ��� the variable investment options constitute the limitedly available mutual funds and we have divided nationwide vl separate accountc into a number of subaccount portfolios identified in��variable investment options beginning on page  to account for your allocations��your investment experience will depend on the market performance of the subaccount portfolios you have chosen �  � we have implemented procedures intended to reduce the potentially detrimental impact that disruptive trading has on subaccount investment experience��for more information see subaccount portfolio transfers beginning on page  and modes to make a transfer beginning on page  � transfers between and among investment options � you may transfer between the fixed and variable investment options subject to conditions��you may transfer among the subaccount portfolios of the variable investment option within limits��for more information see subaccount portfolio

deferral��for more information see the minimum required death benefit beginning on page ��also your beneficiary generally will not have to account for the death benefit proceeds as taxable income��for

you may purchase any of the available riders��availability will vary by state and there may be an additional charge for the additional insurance protection rider � ��� change of insured rider there is no charge for this rider ��� additional insurance protection rider � for more information see riders beginning on page  � in summary policy risks � improper use � variable universal life insurance is not suitable as an investment vehicle for shortterm savings��it is designed for longterm financial planning��you will incur fees at the time of purchase that may more than offset any favorable investment experience��as this may be particularly true early on you should not purchase the policy if you expect that you will need to access its cash value in the near future � unfavorable investment return � the variable investment options to which you have chosen to allocate net premium may not generate a sufficient let alone a positive return especially after the deductions for policy and subaccount portfolio charges��investment experience will impact the cash value and poor investment experience in conjunction with your flexibility to make changes to the policy and deviate from your chosen premium payment plan could cause the cash value of your policy to decrease resulting in a lapse of insurance coverage sooner than might have been foreseen � effect of partial surrenders and loans on investment returns � partial surrenders or policy loans may accelerate a lapse because these amounts will no longer be available to generate any investment return��a partial surrender will reduce the amount of cash value allocated among the subaccount portfolios you have chosen and to the fixed account too if there is not enough cash value in the subaccount portfolios��as collateral for a policy loan we will transfer an equal amount of cash value to the policy loan account which will also reduce the cash value allocated between and among your chosen investment options��thus the remainder of your policys cash value is all that would be available to generate an investment return sufficient to cover policy and subaccount portfolio charges and keep the policy in force at least until you repay the loan or make another premium payment��there will always be a grace period and the opportunity to reinstate insurance coverage��under certain circumstances however the policy could terminate without value and insurance coverage would cease �  � � reduction of the death benefit � a partial surrender or a policy loan would decrease the policy�s death benefit depending on how the death benefit relates to the policy�s cash value � adverse tax consequences existing federal tax laws that benefit this policy may change at any time��these changes could alter the favorable federal income tax treatment the policy enjoys such as the deferral of taxation on the gains in the policys cash value and the exclusion from taxable income of the proceeds we pay to the policys beneficiary��partial and full surrenders from the policy may be subject to taxes��the income tax treatment of the surrender of cash value is different in the event the policy is treated as a modified endowment contract under the code��generally tax treatment on modified endowment contracts will be less favorable when compared to having the policy treated as a life insurance contract��consult a qualified tax adviser on all tax matters involving your policy � fixed account transfer restrictions and limitations � you may transfer cash value to or from the fixed account so long as you make the request after the first year from the policy date��then we will honor a transfer request from the fixed account that is made within  days of the end of a calendar quarter but not within  months of a previous request we may also limit what percentage of cash value you will be permitted to transfer to or from the fixed account � subaccount portfolio investment risk � frequent trading among the subaccounts may dilute the value of your subaccount units cause the subaccount to incur higher transaction costs and interfere with the subaccounts ability to pursue its stated investment objective��this disruption to the subaccount may result in lower investment experience and cash value��we have instituted procedures to minimize disruptive transfers��for more information see subaccount portfolio transfers beginning on page  and modes to make a transfer beginning on page ��while we expect these procedures to reduce the adverse effect of disruptive transfers we cannot assure you that we have eliminated these risks � a comprehensive discussion of the risks of the mutual funds held by each subaccount portfolio may be found in that mutual fund�s prospectus you should read the mutual fund�s prospectus carefully before investing � in summary variable universal life insurance and the policy � variable universal life insurance in general may be important to you in two ways � ��� it will provide economic protection to a beneficiary � ��� it may build cash value � why would you want to purchase this type of life insurance��how will you allocate the net premium among the variable investment options and the fixed investment options��your reasons and decisions will affect the insurance and cash value aspects � while variable universal life insurance is designed primarily to provide life insurance protection the cash value of a policy will be important to you in that it may impair with poor investment results or enhance with favorable investment results your ability to pay the costs of keeping the insurance in force � apart from the life insurance protection features you will have an interest in maximizing the value of the policy as a financial asset � it is similar to but also different from universal life insurance � ��� you will pay premiums for life insurance coverage on the insured � ��� the policy will provide for the accumulation of a cash surrender value if you were to surrender it at any time while the insured is alive � ��� the cash surrender value could be substantially lower than the premiums you have paid � what makes the policy different from universal life insurance is your opportunity to allocate premiums after charges to the subaccount portfolios you have chosen��also this policy�s cash value will vary depending on the market performance of the subaccount portfolios and you will bear this risk � from the time we issue the policy through the insured�s death following is a basic overview�� please read the remainder of this prospectus for the details � ��� at issue the policy will require a minimum initial premium payment �  � � among other considerations this amount will be based on the insured�s age the underwriting class any substandard ratings the specified amount and the choice of a rider � ��� at the time of a premium payment we will deduct transaction fees � ��� you will then be able to allocate the premium net of transaction fees or net premium between and among a fixed and the variable investment options � ��� from the policy�s cash value on a periodic basis we will deduct other charges to help cover the mortality risks we assumed and the sales and administrative costs��we call these charges periodic charges other than subaccount portfolio operating expenses � ��� you may be able to vary the timing and amount of premium payments � so long as there is enough cash surrender value to cover the policys periodic charges as they come due the policy will remain in force � ��� after the first policy year you may request to increase or decrease the policy�s specified amount � this flexibility will allow you to adjust the policy to meet your changing needs and circumstances subject to additional underwriting for us to evaluate an increase of risk confirmation that the policy�s tax status is not jeopardized and confirmation that the minimum and maximum insurance amounts remain met � ��� the policy will pay a death benefit to the beneficiary��you have a choice of one of three options � as your insurance needs change you may be able to change death benefit options rather than buying a new policy or terminating this policy � ��� prior to the insured�s death you may withdraw all or a portion after the first policy year of the policy�s cash surrender value��or you may borrow against the cash surrender value � withdrawals and loans are subject to restrictions may reduce the death benefit and increase the likelihood of the policy lapsing��there also could be adverse tax consequences �  � in summary fee tables � the following tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying owning and surrendering the policy��fees in this table may be rounded to the hundredth decimal��the first table describes the fees and expenses that you will pay at the time that you buy the policy surrender the policy or transfer cash value between investmentoptions � for

from this charge �  the maximum guaranteed charge is reduced to  of premium payment starting with the eighth policy year��currently the charges for policies vary according to the time of purchase the amount of the additional protection rider and amount of annual premium��for more information see premium load charge beginning on page  �  the charge is the lesser of  or  of the dollar amount of a

repayment we transfer an equal amount of cash value to the policy loan account on which interest accrues and is credited daily��the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate is stated on your policy

portion of your net premium to any subaccount��when this actually happens depends on the righttoexamine law of the state in which you live��or you may choose to allocate all or a portion of your net premium to the fixed investment option and we will allocate it when we receive it � based on the right to examine law some states require that we refund the initial premium if you exercise your right to cancel the policy��others require that we return the cash value��if yours is a state that requires us to refund the initial premium we will hold the initial net premium in the available money market subaccount until the freelook period expires��once your examination right ends we will transfer the variable account cash value to your subaccount allocations in effect at the time of the transfer��if yours is a state that requires us to refund the cash value we will allocate the net premiums to the subaccount choices in effect when we receive the premium payment��after your right to cancel the policy expires all premium payments will be allocated to the subaccount choices in effect when we received the premium payment � the fixed investment option � the premium you allocate to

exists making disposal or valuation of securities held in the separate account impracticable or ��� the sec by order permits a suspension or postponement for the protection of security holders � sec rules and regulations govern when the conditions described above exist��any transaction you try to effect when we are closed will not happen until the next day we and the nyse are both open for business � how subaccount investment experience is determined � though the number of subaccount units will not change as a result of investment experience changes in the net investment factor as described below may cause the value of a subaccount unit to increase or decrease from valuation period to valuation period��changes in the net investment factor may not be directly proportional to changes in the net asset value of the mutual fund shares because of the deduction for mortality and expense risk charge and any charge or credit for tax reserves � we determine the change in subaccount values at the end of a valuation period��the subaccount unit value for a valuation period is determined by multiplying the subaccount unit value as of the prior valuation period by the net investment factor for the subaccount for the current valuation period � we determine the net investment factor for any valuation period by dividing a by b and then subtracting c where � a is the sum of � ��� the net asset value per share of the mutual fund held in the subaccount as of the end of the current valuation period and ��� the per share amount of any dividend or income distributions made by the mutual fund if the date of the dividend or income distribution occurs during the current valuation period plus or minus ��� a per share charge or credit for any taxes reserved for as a result of the subaccounts investment operations if changes to the law result in a modification to the tax treatment of the separate account and � � b is the net asset value per share of the mutual fund determined as of the end of the immediately preceding valuation period after taxes or tax credits and � c is a charge for mortality and expense risk � cash value � the policy has a cash value��there is no guaranteed cash value��the cash value will vary depending on where you allocate your net premium��amounts allocated to the fixed account and policy loan account vary based on the daily crediting of interest to those accounts��amounts allocated to the subaccount portfolios vary daily based on the investment experience of the subaccount portfolios��it will also vary because we deduct the policys periodic charges from the cash value��so if the policys cash value is part of the death benefit option you have chosen then your death benefit will fluctuate � we compute the cash value of your policy by adding the subaccount portfolio unit values to the money you have allocated to the fixed investment option and adding the amount in the policy loan account � we will determine the value of the assets in the separate account at the end of each valuation period��we will determine the cash value at least monthly to determine the number of subaccount units credited to each subaccount we divide the net amount you allocate to the subaccount by the subaccount unit value for the subaccount using the next valuation period following when we receive the premium � if you surrender part or all of the policy we will deduct a number of subaccount units from the separate account and an amount from the fixed account that corresponds to the surrendered amount��thus your policy�s cash value will be reduced by the surrendered amount��if we assess a partial surrender charge we will subtract the charge from the proceeds before delivering the net amount to you � similarly when we assess charges or deductions a number of subaccount units from the separate account and an amount from the fixed account that corresponds with the charge or deduction will be deducted from the policy�s cash value��unless you direct otherwise we make these deductions in the same proportion that your interests in the separate account and the fixed account bear to the policy�s total cash value � the cash value in the fixed account and the policy loan account is credited with interest daily at the guaranteed minimum annual effective rate stated on the policy data page��we may decide to credit interest in excess of the guaranteed minimum �  � annual effective rate��for the fixed account we will guarantee the current rate in effect through the end of the calendar quarter upon request we will inform you of the current applicable rates for each account��for more information see the fixed investment option beginning on page  and loan amount and interest beginning on page  � on any date during the policy year the cash value equals the cash value on the preceding valuation period plus any net premium applied since the previous valuation period minus any policy charges plus or minus any investment results and minus any partial surrenders � transfers among and between policy investment options � subaccount portfolio transfers � we will determine the amount you have available for transfers among the subaccount portfolios in units based on the net asset value nav per share of the mutual fund in which a subaccount portfolio invests��the mutual fund will determine its nav once daily as of the close of the regular business session of the new york stock exchange usually  pm eastern time��a unit will not equal the nav of the mutual fund in which the subaccount portfolio invests however because the unit value will reflect the deduction for any transaction fees and periodic charges��for more information see in summary fee tables beginning on page  and how subaccount investment experience is determined beginning on page  � disruptive trading practices which hamper the orderly pursuit of stated investment objectives by underlying mutual fund managers may adversely affect the performance of the subaccounts��prior to the policy�s maturity date you may transfer among the available subaccount portfolios however in instances of disruptive trading that we may determine or may have already determined to be harmful to policy owners we will through the use of appropriate means available to us attempt to curtail or limit the disruptive trading��we cannot guarantee that our attempts to deter active trading strategies will be successful��if active trading strategies are not successfully deterred by our actions the performance of subaccounts that are actively traded will be adversely impacted��if your trading activities or those of a third party acting on your behalf constitute disruptive trading we will not limit your ability to initiate the trades as provided in your policy however we may limit your means for making a transfer or take other action we deem necessary to protect the interests of those investing in the affected subaccounts��if you intend to use an active trading strategy you should consult your registered representative and request information on our other policy that offers subaccounts designed specifically to support active trading � we may add new underlying mutual funds or new share classes of currently available underlying mutual funds that assess shortterm trading fees��in the case of new share class additions your subsequent allocations may be limited to that new share class��shortterm trading fees are a charge assessed by an underlying mutual fund when you transfer out of a subaccount before the end of a stated period��these fees will only apply to subaccounts corresponding to underlying mutual funds that impose such a charge��the underlying mutual fund intends shortterm trading fees to compensate the fund and its shareholders for the negative impact on fund performance that may result from disruptive trading practices including frequent trading and shortterm trading market timing strategies��the fees are not intended to adversely impact policy owners not engaged in such strategies��the separate account will collect the shortterm trading fees at the time of the transfer by reducing the policy owner�s subaccount value��we will remit all such fees to the underlying mutual fund � underlying mutual fund restrictions and prohibitions��pursuant to regulations adopted by the sec we are required to enter into written agreements with the underlying mutual funds which allow the underlying mutual funds to � �� request the taxpayer identification number international taxpayer identification number or other government issued identifier of any of our policy owners �� request the amounts and dates of any purchase redemption transfer or exchange request �transaction information� and �� instruct us to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges by policy owners that violate policies established by the underlying mutual fund whose policies may be more restrictive than our policies � we are required to provide such transaction information to the underlying mutual funds upon their request��in addition we are required to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchange requests upon instruction from the underlying mutual fund��we and any affected policy owner may not have advance notice of such instructions from an underlying mutual fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchange requests��if an underlying mutual fund refuses to accept a purchase or exchange request submitted by us we will keep any affected policy owner in their current underlying mutual fund allocation � fixed account transfers � prior to the policy�s maturity date you may also make transfers involving the fixed account��these transfers will be in

to the fixed account we may not permit you to transfer over  of the cash value allocated to the subaccount portfolios as of the close of business of the prior valuation period��we reserve the right to refuse any transfer to the fixed account if the fixed account�s cash value comprises more than  of the policy�s cash value you may not request a transfer to the fixed account before the end of the first year from the policy date � on transfers from the fixed account we may permit you transfers of no more than  of the cash value of the fixed account as of the end of the previous policy year subject to state restrictions��any transfers you make from the fixed account must be within  days of the end of a interest rate guaranteed period��an interest rate guaranteed period is the time that a stated interest rate is guaranteed to remain in effect��currently interest crediting rates are reset at the beginning of each calendar quarter � modes to make a transfer � to make a transfer send your

rider but we base future policy charges on the characteristics of the new insured��you may elect this rider at any time � additional insurance protection rider � this rider is only available to purchase when you purchase the policy��the benefit is supplemental life insurance on the insured��the policy pays a benefit in addition to the base nonrider death benefit to the beneficiary upon the insured�s death � before deciding whether to purchase the additional insurance protection rider it is important for you to know that when you purchase this rider the compensation received by your registered representative and his or her firm is less than when compared to purchasing insurance coverage under the base policy��as a result of this compensation reduction the charges assessed for the cost of insurance under this rider will be lower for a significant period of time � the benefit amount varies monthly and is based on the death benefit option you have chosen��for more information see death benefit options on page  � the rider�s cost is determined by multiplying a monthly cost of insurance by the rider�s death benefit amount��for more information see in summary fee tables beginning on page ��you may renew coverage annually until the policy maturity date � certain terms and conditions apply to the rider including that two years after the rider�s effective date we will not contest the payment of the benefit for any reason other than you failing to pay enough premium to cover the cost of insurance for the rider��also if the insured dies of suicide within two years of the rider taking effect we will pay the cost of insurance we deducted for the rider but not the rider�s death benefit��if the age of the insured is misstated or erroneous we will adjust the rider�s death benefit to reflect the true age � �  � premium � this policy does not require a scheduled payment of premium to keep it in force��the policy will remain in effect as long as the conditions that cause the policy to lapse do not exist � initial premium � the amount of the initial premium required for us to issue this policy will depend on the initial specified amount of insurance you request the death benefit option you select and any riders you select��generally the higher the required initial specified amount the higher the initial premium will be��similarly because death benefit options two and three provide for a potentially greater death benefit than death benefit option one death benefit options two and three may require a higher amount of premiums��also the age health and activities of the insured will affect our determination of the risk of issuing the policy��in general the greater this risk the higher the initial premium will be � whether we will issue full insurance coverage depends on the insured meeting all underwriting requirements you paying the initial premium and our delivery of the policy while the insured is alive��we will not delay delivery of the policy to increase the likelihood that the insured is not still living��depending on the outcome of our underwriting process more or less premium may be necessary for us to issue the policy��we also retain the right to not issue the policy��if we exercise this right we will return your payment within two business days � you may pay the initial premium to our home office or to our authorized representative��the initial premium payment must be at least  per policy��the initial premium payment will not be applied to the policy until the underwriting process is complete � subsequent premiums � you may make additional premium payments at any time while the policy is in force subject to the following � ��� we may require satisfactory evidence of insurability before accepting any additional premium payment that results in an increase in the policy�s net amount at risk��whether we exercise this right depends on the length of time since the policy date the standard underwriting criteria for the amount of insurance after the requested increase the number of policies owned by the policy owner and the degree of uniformity with respect to the requested increases across the policies owned by the policy owner��the longer the period the greater the difference between the underwriting class at the time of issue and at the time of the increase and the less uniform the changes across all policies you own the more likely we will be to exercise this right��if we do not exercise our right to refuse a premium payment which increases our net amount at risk we do not waive our right to refuse subsequent premium payments which increase our net amount at risk � ��� we will refund premium payments that exceed the applicable premium limit established by the irs to qualify the policy as a contract for life insurance��as discussed in the taxes section of this prospectus additional premium payments or other changes to the policy may jeopardize the policys nonmodified endowment status��we will monitor premiums paid and other policy transactions and will notify you when the policy�s nonmodified endowment contract status is in jeopardy and � ��� we may require that policy indebtedness be repaid prior to accepting any additional premium payments��some but not all of the situations when we might exercise this right include when your policy loans exceed  of the cash value when the premium payment would result in an increase in the net amount at risk or when a premium payment may alter the character of the policy for tax purposes��we will tell you that we intend to apply the money you have sent us to loan repayment rather than as a premium payment before processing the transaction � if you decide to make a subsequent premium payment you must send it to our home office��each premium payment must be at least  per policy � charges � please read and consider the following which we intend to be an amplification but it may also be duplicative in conjunction with the fee tables and the accompanying footnotes appearing earlier in the prospectus��see in summary fee tables beginning on page ��also see the policy including the policy data page and the riders for more information � we will make deductions under the policy to compensate us for the services and benefits we provide the costs and expenses we incur and the risks we assume��every time you make a premium payment we will charge against that premium payment a premium load which is composed of the sales load and premium taxes��we will deduct all other charges from the policy�s cash value rather

contained in the prospectus for the mutual fund � premium load charge � this charge partially recoups sales expenses and premium taxes��after this charge is deducted the remaining premium is invested

first year from the policy date and we may charge a partial surrender fee of the lesser of  or  of the surrendered amount to compensate us for the administrative costs in calculating and generating the surrender amount��currently we do not assess this charge � cost of insurance � we will determine this charge by multiplying the current nonrider monthly cost of insurance rate by the net amount at risk for the base portion of the specified amount��this charge compensates us for providing insurance protection under the policy � we base the cost of insurance rates on our expectancies of future mortality and expense��the current cost of insurance rate will vary by demographic factors such as age tobacco use duration since issue specified amount underwriting class and any substandard ratings��the current cost of insurance charges are based on future expectations for factors such as mortality �  � investment earnings persistency expenses and taxes��any changes in these expectations may result in increased cost of insurance charges for your policy if so your policys cash value will be adversely affected in future years � we may underwrite your policy on a nonmedical basis that may result in a higher cost of insurance charge��nonmedical underwriting means that a physical examination to obtain medical information on the proposed insured is not required to issue the policy��the higher cost of insurance charge would compensate us for assuming additional mortality risk as a result of issuing without the information that results from medical underwriting � we may use a separate cost of insurance rate for the initial specified amount and any increase��periodically we will reevaluate the current base nonrider cost of insurance rates based on our expectations about future experience��any changes in the current cost of insurance rates will be uniformly applied to insureds of the same underwriting rate class � mortality and expense risk � the charge compensates us for assuming risks associated with mortality and expense costs and we may profit from it��the mortality risk is that the insured does not live as long as expected��the expense risk is that the costs of issuing and administering the policy are more than expected��this charge is guaranteed not to exceed  of the policys cash value on an annualized basis��the current charge which applies to policies with applications signed on or after january   declines over time as follows � charge for policy years  charge for policy years  charge for policy years   of daily net assets  of daily net assets  of daily net assets � � a separate mortality and expense risk charge schedule applies to policies with applications signed before january   as follows charge for policy years  charge for policy years  charge for policy years   of daily net assets  of daily net assets  of daily net assets � policy loan interest � we charge interest on the amount of an outstanding policy loan at a rate no greater than  per annum which will accrue daily and become due and payable at the end of each year from the policy date or at the time you take an additional loan��if left unpaid we will add it to the policys outstanding indebtedness � as collateral or security for repayment we will transfer an equal amount of cash value to the policy loan account on which interest will accrue and be credited daily the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate is stated on the policy data page � administrative � the maximum guaranteed administrative charge is  but we currently are charging ��this charge reimburses us for the costs of maintaining the policy including accounting and record keeping � additional insurance protection rider � this charge compensates us for providing supplemental life insurance on the insured��we will determine this charge by multiplying the rider�s current cost of insurance rate by the net amount at risk for the rider portion of the specified amount � we base the additional protection cost of insurance rate on our expectation as to the insureds mortality��the additional protection cost of insurance rate will vary by the insureds age tobacco use duration since issue underwriting class any substandard ratings and the specified amount of the rider��periodically we will reevaluate the rider�s current cost of insurance rates based on our expectations about future experience��any changes in the current cost of insurance rates will be uniformly applied to insureds of the same underwriting rate class��any changes in these expectations may result in increased cost of insurance charges for the rider � a note on charges � during a policys early years the expenses we incur in distributing and establishing the policy exceed the deductions we take��nevertheless we expect to make a profit over time because variable life insurance is intended to be a longterm financial investment��accordingly we have designed the policy with features and investment options that we believe support and encourage longterm ownership �  � � we make many assumptions and account for many economic and financial factors when we establish the policys fees and charges��the following is a discussion of some of the factors that are relevant to the policys pricing structure � distribution promotional and sales expenses��distribution promotional and sales expenses include amounts we pay to brokerdealer firms as commissions expense allowances and marketing allowances��we refer to these expenses collectively as total compensation the maximum total compensation we pay to any brokerdealer firm in conjunction with policy sales is  of first year premiums and  of renewal premium after the first year � we have the ability to customize the total compensation package of our brokerdealer firms��we may vary the form of compensation paid or the amounts paid as commission expense allowance or marketing allowance however the total compensation will not exceed the maximum  of first year premiums and  of renewal premium after the first year��commission may also be paid as an assetbased amount instead of a premium based amount��if an assetbased commission is paid it will not exceed  of the nonloaned cash value per year � the actual amount andor forms of total compensation we pay depend on factors such as the level of premiums we receive from respective brokerdealer firms and the scope of services they provide��some brokerdealer firms may not receive maximum total compensation � individual registered representatives typically receive a portion of the commissionstotal compensation we pay depending on their arrangement with their brokerdealer firm��if you would like to know the exact compensation arrangement associated with this product you should consult your registered representative � information on underlying mutual fund payments � our relationship with the underlying mutual funds��the underlying mutual funds incur expenses each time they sell administer or redeem their shares��the separate account aggregates policy owner purchase redemption and transfer requests and submits net or aggregated purchaseredemption requests to each underlying mutual fund daily��the separate account not the policy owners is the underlying mutual fund shareholder��when the separate account aggregates transactions the underlying mutual fund does not incur the expense of processing individual transactions it would normally incur if it sold its shares directly to the public��we incur these expenses instead � we also incur the distribution costs of selling the policy as discussed above which benefit the underlying mutual funds by providing policy owners with subaccount options that correspond to the underlying mutual funds�� � an investment adviser or subadviser of an underlying mutual fund or its affiliates may provide us or our affiliates with wholesaling services that assist in the distribution of the policy and may pay us or our affiliates to participate in educational andor marketing activities��these activities may provide the adviser or subadviser or their affiliates with increased exposure to persons involved in the distribution of the policy � types of payments we receive��in light of the above the underlying mutual funds or their affiliates make certain payments to us or our affiliates the �payments���the amount of these payments is typically based on a percentage of assets invested in the underlying mutual funds attributable to the policies and other variable policies we and our affiliates issue but in some cases may involve a flat fee��these payments may be used by us for any corporate purpose which include reducing the prices of the policies paying expenses that we or our affiliates incur in promoting marketing and administering the policies and the underlying mutual funds and achieving a profit � we or our affiliates receive the following types of payments � ��� underlying mutual fund b fees which are deducted from underlying mutual fund assets � ��� subtransfer agent fees or fees pursuant to administrative service plans adopted by the underlying mutual fund which may be deducted from underlying mutual fund assets and � ��� payments by an underlying mutual fund�s adviser or subadviser or its affiliates��such payments may be derived in whole or in part from the advisory fee which is deducted from underlying mutual fund assets and is reflected in mutual fund charges � furthermore we benefit from assets invested in our affiliated underlying mutual funds ie nationwide variable insurance trust because our affiliates also receive compensation from the underlying mutual funds for investment advisory administrative transfer agency distribution andor other services��thus we may receive more revenue with respect to affiliated underlying mutual funds than unaffiliated underlying mutual funds � we took into consideration the anticipated payments from the underlying mutual funds when we determined the charges imposed under the policies apart from fees and expenses imposed by the underlying mutual funds��without these payments we would have imposed higher charges under the policy �  � � amount of payments we receive��for the year ended december   the underlying mutual fund payments we and our affiliates received from the underlying mutual funds did not exceed  as a percentage of the average daily net assets invested in the underlying mutual funds offered through this policy or other variable policies that we and our affiliates issue��payments from investment advisers or subadvisers to participate in educational andor marketing activities have not been taken into account in this percentage � most underlying mutual funds or their affiliates have agreed to make payments to us or our affiliates although the applicable percentages may vary from underlying mutual fund to underlying mutual fund and some may not make any payments at all��because the amount of the actual payments we or our affiliates receive depends on the assets of the underlying mutual funds attributable to the policy we and our affiliates may receive higher payments from underlying mutual funds with lower percentages but greater assets than from underlying mutual funds that have higher percentages but fewer assets � for additional information related to the amount of payments nationwide receives go to wwwnationwidecom � identification of underlying mutual funds���we may consider several criteria when identifying the underlying mutual funds including some or all of the following��investment objectives investment process investment performance risk characteristics investment capabilities experience and resources investment consistency and fund expenses��another factor we consider during the identification process is whether the underlying mutual fund�s adviser or subadviser is one of our affiliates or whether the underlying mutual fund its adviser its subadvisers or an affiliate will make payments to us or our affiliates � there may be underlying mutual funds with lower fees as well as other variable policies that offer underlying mutual funds with lower fees��you should consider all of the fees and charges of the policy in relation to its features and benefits when making your decision to invest��please note that higher policy and underlying mutual fund fees and charges have a direct effect on your investment performance � the death benefit � calculation of the death benefit proceeds � we will calculate the death benefit and pay it to the beneficiary when we receive at our home office proof that the insured has died as well as other customary information��the death benefit may be subject to an adjustment if death occurs within the contestability period or at any time if there has been a material misstatement � while the policy is in force the death benefit will never be less than the specified amount the death benefit will depend on which option you have chosen and the tax test as described in the following minimum required death benefit section you have elected��also the death benefit may vary with the cash value of the policy which depends on investment performance��you may choose one of three death benefit options��not all death benefit options are available in all states��if you do not elect a death benefit the policy�s death benefit will be option  � for policies issued after the later of may   or the date we are authorized to issue policies with a maximum death benefit within your state we reserve the right to limit the amount of insurance under any policy to the maximum death benefit��currently the maximum death benefit is equal to the sum of the cash value and the lesser of i  of the specified amount on the policy issue date and ii ��we may increase the maximum death benefit at our sole discretion � we will calculate the death benefit on the monthly anniversary and upon the death of the insured��if the calculation exceeds the maximum death benefit we reserve the right to pay to you a predeath distribution to reduce the cash value so that the death benefit will not exceed the sum of the cash value and the lesser of i  of the specified amount on the policy issue date and ii ��if death benefit option  is applicable and the accumulated premium account is greater than the cash value we reserve the right to reduce the amount previously credited to the accumulated premium account to an amount equal to  of the cash value immediately before the distribution��for example if at the time of the predeath distribution your cash value is  and your accumulated premium account is  we would reduce your accumulated premium account by  to  ie  of the cash value the accumulated premium account will not become less than zero because of a predeath distribution � the maximum death benefit may under certain circumstances curtail the flexibility that the policy affords you for example the policys cash value may increase at a rate that outpaces the ratio of cash value to life insurance permitted under the internal revenue code��in some instances you and we may address this situation by increasing the specified amount of insurance so that the policys ratio of cash value to life insurance is readjusted to comply with the tax code definition��if however an increase in the specified amount would cause the death benefit to exceed the maximum death benefit then this method of achieving compliance with the tax code definition of life insurance may not be available � we will notify you that a predeath distribution andor a reduction in the accumulated premium account has been generated��we will send this notice no later than thirty days after we become aware that the maximum death benefit has been exceeded �  � � taxes arising from the predeath distribution if any are your responsibility��we urge you to confer with your tax adviser regarding tax implications of receiving a predeath distribution prior to the purchase of this policy � death benefit options � there are the three death benefit options under the policy��you may choose one if you do not choose one of the following death benefit options we will assume that you intended to choose death benefit option  � ��� option  � the death benefit will be the greater of the specified amount or the minimum required death benefit � ��� option  � the death benefit will be the greater of the specified amount plus the cash value as of the date of death which will vary with the investment performance or the minimum required death benefit � ��� option  � the death benefit will be the greater of the sum of the specified amount on the date of death and the accumulated premium account which consists of all premium payments accumulated to the date of the death less partial surrenders accumulated to the date of death or the minimum required death benefit � the proceeds payable upon the death of the insured are equal to death benefit reduced by policy indebtedness and unpaid charges and increased by any insurance provided by riders��also for policies to which an other amount paid at surrender is available as of the time the proceeds become payable may receive an additional payment��for more information see other amounts paid at surrender beginning on page ��this additional payment will be based on the other amount paid at surrender at the time the proceeds become payable � the minimum required death benefit � each death benefit option has a minimum required death benefit��the minimum required death benefit is the lowest death benefit that will qualify the policy as life insurance under section  of the code � the tax tests for life insurance generally require that the policy have a significant element of life insurance and not be primarily an investment vehicle � at the time we issue the policy you irrevocably elect one of the following tests to qualify the policy as life insurance under section  of the code � ��� the cash value accumulation test or � ��� the guideline premiumcash value corridor test � the cash value accumulation test determines the minimum required death benefit by multiplying the account value by a percentage set out in the federal tax regulations to the code the percentages depend upon the insureds age sex and underwriting classification � under the cash value accumulation test there is no limit to the amount that may be paid in premiums as long as there is sufficient death benefit in relation to the account value at all times � the guideline premiumcash value corridor test determines the minimum required death benefit by comparing the death benefit to an applicable percentage of the cash value��these percentages are set out in the code but the percentage varies only by the attained age of the insured � regardless of which test you elect we will monitor compliance to assure that the policy meets the statutory definition of life insurance for federal tax purposes��as a result the death proceeds payable under a policy should be excludable from gross income of the beneficiary for federal income tax purposes � if you do not elect a test we will assume that you intended to elect the cash value accumulation test � changes in the death benefit option � after the first policy year you may elect to change the death benefit option under the policy from either option  to option  or from option  to option ��you may not change from or to option ��we will permit only one change of death benefit option per policy year��the effective date of a change will be the monthly anniversary date following the date we approve the change � for any change in the death benefit option to become effective the cash surrender value after the change must be sufficient to keep the policy in force for at least three months �  � � we will adjust the specified amount so that the difference between the death benefit and the cash value ie the net amount at risk remains constant before and after the death benefit option change��because your net amount at risk is the same before and after the reduction reducing the specified amount by itself does not alter the policy�s cost of insurance��the policy�s charges going forward however will be based on a new specified amount that will change the calculation of those charges��depending on changes in factors such as the cash value these charges may increase or decrease after the reduction � where the policy owner has selected the guideline premiumcash value corridor test a change in death benefit option will not be permitted if it results in the total premiums paid exceeding the maximum premium limitations under section  of the code � suicide � if the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane within two years from the policy date we will pay no more than the sum of the premiums paid less any indebtedness and less any partial surrenders��if the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane within two years from the date we accept an application for an increase in the specified amount we will pay no more than the death benefit associated with the initial specified amount plus the cost of insurance charges associated with the increase in specified amount � surrenders � full surrender � you may surrender the policy for the cash surrender value at any time while the insured is alive��we calculate the cash surrender value based on the policys cash value��for more information see cash value beginning on page ��to derive the cash surrender value we will deduct from the cash value any due and payable periodic charges and indebtedness��the effective date of a surrender will coincide with the date on which we receive the policy and your written request at our home office��we reserve the right to postpone payment of that portion of the cash surrender value attributable to the fixed account for up to six months � other amounts paid at surrender � for a policy purchased by a corporation or another entity an amount may be paid by us in addition to the policy�s cash surrender value if during a limited specified time period the policy is completely surrendered and the surrender proceeds are paid directly to the policy owner as of the date of issue��we will inform you of the availability of this arrangement at the time you apply for the policy��this payment will not be made from the policy but is a separate obligation of nationwide��this additional payment does not apply to a partial surrender to a policy loan or to a complete surrender for which you instruct us to pay the proceeds to a party other than the policy owner as of the date of issue an additional surrender payment may also be available to an individually owned policy if the premiums are paid by a corporate sponsor to whom the individual has assigned rights under the policy � the amount duration and availability of additional surrender payments��may vary based on a number of factors including � ��� the number of insureds � ��� the nature of the relationship among individual insureds � ��� the purpose for which the policies are being purchased � ��� the expected persistency of the policies and � ��� any other circumstances which are rationally related to an expected reduction in acquisition or administrative costs � we will pay surrender payments that are in addition to the policy�s cash surrender value from our general account��we urge you to consult with your tax adviser about the tax treatment of additional surrender payments��the criteria for additional surrender payments may change from time to time��additional surrender payments will be determined in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory to policy owners � partial surrender � after the policy has been in force for one year you may request a partial surrender by sending a written request to the address on the first page of this prospectus��we reserve the right to limit partial surrenders to one per year � we permit partial surrenders if the partial surrender satisfies the following requirements � ��� the minimum partial surrender is  � � �  � � � ��� a partial surrender may not cause the total specified amount to be reduced below the minimum specified amount shown on the policy data page � ��� the maximum amount of a partial surrender is the cash surrender value less the greater of  or three monthly deductions and � ��� after the partial surrender the policy continues to qualify as life insurance � reduction of specified amount on a partial surrender � when a partial surrender is made we reduce the cash value by the amount of the partial surrender��if the policy assets are held in more than one subaccount we effect the partial surrender proportionately from the assets in each subaccount at the time of the partial surrender we will distribute amounts from the fixed account only when there are insufficient amounts in the subaccounts � when you take a partial surrender ordinarily we will reduce the specified amount so that the net amount at risk does not increase��because your net amount at risk is the same before and after the reduction a partial surrender by itself does not alter the policy�s cost of insurance��the policy�s charges going forward however will be based on a new specified amount that will change the calculation of those charges��depending on changes in factors such as the fluctuation in the policy�s cash value these charges may increase or decrease after the reduction in specified amount � however we will not decrease the specified amount by more than the partial surrender amount reduced by any preferred partial surrenders��a preferred partial surrender is a partial surrender that � ��� occurs before the th policy anniversary and � ��� when added to any prior preferred policy surrenders in that same policy year it does not exceed  of the cash surrender value as of the beginning of the policy year � any reduction we make to the specified amount will be made in the following order � ��� against the most recent increase in the specified amount � ��� against the next most recent increases in the specified amount in succession and � ��� against the specified amount under the original application � while we reserve the right to deduct a partial surrender fee we currently deduct none��certain partial surrenders may result in currently taxable income and tax penalties��also partial surrenders could cause your policy to become a modified endowment contract under the code which would change the income tax treatment of any distributions from the policy��for more information see periodic withdrawals nonperiodic withdrawals and

� so long as your policy�s cash surrender value is enough to cover the monthly deduction of charges on each monthly anniversary date the policy will remain in force��the cash surrender value could be

� the tax treatment of life insurance policies under the code is complex and the tax treatment of your policy will depend on your particular circumstances���seek competent tax advice regarding the tax treatment of the policy given your situation��the following discussion provides an overview of the code�s provisions relating to certain common life insurance policy transactions��it is not and cannot be comprehensive and it cannot replace personalized advice provided by a competent tax professional � types of taxes of which to be aware � federal income tax��generally the united states assesses a tax on income which is broadly defined to include all items of income from whatever source unless specifically excluded��certain expenditures can reduce income for tax purposes and correspondingly the amount of tax payable��these expenditures are called deductions��while there are many more income tax concepts under the code the concepts of income and deduction are the most fundamental to the federal income tax treatment that pertains to this policy � federal transfer tax��in addition to the income tax the united states also assesses a tax on some or all of the value of certain transfers of wealth made by gift while a person is living the federal gift tax and by bequest or otherwise at the time of a person�s death the federal estate tax � the federal gift tax is imposed on the value of the property including cash transferred by gift��each donor is allowed to exclude an amount in  up to  per recipient from the value of present interest gifts��in addition each donor is allowed a credit against the tax on the first million dollars in lifetime gifts calculated after taking into account the  exclusion amount��an unlimited marital deduction may be available for certain lifetime gifts made by the donor to the donors spouse��unlike the estate tax the gift tax is not scheduled to be repealed � in general in  an estate of less than  inclusive of certain predeath gifts will not incur a federal estate tax liability��the  million amount increases to  million in ��the federal estate tax but not the federal gift tax is scheduled to be repealed effective after  however unless congress acts to make that repeal permanent the estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated with respect to decedents who die after december  ��if the estate tax is reinstated and congress has not acted further the size of estates that will not incur an estate tax will revert to  million �  � � an unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate tax purposes for certain amounts that pass to the surviving spouse � if the transfer is made to someone two or more generations younger than the transferor the transfer may be subject to the federal generationskipping transfer tax gstt��the gstt provisions generally apply to the same transfers that are subject to estate or gift taxes��the tax is imposed at a flat rate equal to the maximum estate tax rate for   and there is a provision for an aggregate  million exemption��the gstt is scheduled to be repealed effective after  however unless congress acts to make that repeal permanent the gstt is scheduled to be reinstated on january   at a rate of  � state and local taxes��state and local estate inheritance income and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each policy owner or beneficiary��while these taxes may or may not be substantial in your case state by state differences of these taxes preclude a useful description of them in this prospectus � buying the policy � federal income tax��generally the code treats life insurance premiums as a personal expense��this means that under the general rule you cannot deduct from your taxable income the premiums paid to purchase the policy � federal transfer tax��generally the code treats the payment of premiums on a life insurance policy as a gift when the premium payment benefits someone else such as when premium payments are paid by someone other than the policy owner��gifts are not generally included in the recipient�s taxable income��if you whether or not you are the insured transfer ownership of the policy to another person the transfer may be subject to a federal gift tax � investment gain in the policy � the income tax treatment of changes in the policy�s cash value depends on whether the policy is life insurance under the code��if the policy meets the definition of life insurance then the increase in the policy�s cash value is not included in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes unless it is distributed to you before the death of the insured � to qualify as life insurance the policy must meet certain tests set out in section  of the code��we will monitor the policy�s compliance with code section  and take whatever steps are necessary to stay in compliance � diversification��in addition to meeting the tests required under section  section h of the code requires that the investments of the separate account be adequately diversified��regulations under code section h provide that a variable life policy that fails to satisfy the diversification standards will not be treated as life insurance unless such failure was inadvertent is corrected and the policy owner or the issuer pays an amount to the irs��if the failure to diversify is not corrected the income and gain in the contract would be treated as taxable ordinary income for federal income tax purposes � we will also monitor compliance with code section h and the regulations applicable to section h and to the extent necessary will change the objectives or assets of the subaccount investments to remain in compliance��thus the policy should receive federal income tax treatment as life insurance � representatives of the irs have informally suggested from time to time that the number of underlying mutual funds available or the number of transfer opportunities available under a variable product may be relevant in determining whether the product qualifies for the desired tax treatment��in  the irs issued formal guidance in revenue ruling  that indicates that if the number of underlying mutual funds available in a variable insurance product does not exceed  the number of funds alone would not cause the policy to not qualify for the desired tax treatment��the irs has also indicated that exceeding  investment options may be considered a factor along with other factors including the number of transfer opportunities available under the policy when determining whether the policy qualifies for the desired tax treatment��the revenue ruling did not indicate the number of fund options if any that would cause the policy to not provide the desired tax treatment��should the us secretary of the treasury issue additional rules or regulations limiting the number of underlying mutual funds transfers between underlying mutual funds exchanges of underlying mutual funds or changes in the investment objectives of underlying mutual funds such that the policy would no longer qualify as life insurance under section  of the code we will take whatever steps are available to remain in compliance � periodic withdrawals nonperiodic withdrawals and loans � the tax treatment described in this section applies to withdrawals and loans you choose to take from the policy��it also applies to premiums we accept but then return to meet the codes definition of life insurance � the income tax treatment of distributions of cash from the policy depends on whether the policy is also a modified endowment contract under the code generally the income tax consequences of owning a life insurance contract that is not a modified endowment contract are more advantageous than the tax consequences of owning a life insurance contract that is a modified endowment contract � the policies offered by this prospectus may or may not be issued as modified endowment contracts��if a contract is issued as �  � a modified endowment contract it will always be a modified endowment contract a contract that is not issued as a modified endowment contract can become a modified endowment contract due to subsequent transactions with respect to the contract such as payment of additional premiums��if the contract is not issued as a modified endowment contract we will monitor it and advise you if��the payment of a premium or other transaction may cause the contract to become a modified endowment contract � when the policy is life insurance that is a modified endowment contract��section a of the code defines modified endowment contracts as those life insurance policies issued or materially changed on or after june   on which the total premiums paid during the first seven years exceed the amount that would have been paid if the policy provided for paid up benefits after seven level annual premiums��under certain conditions a policy may become a modified endowment contract or may become subject to a new  year testing period as a result of a material change or a reduction in benefits as defined by section ac of the code � all modified endowment contracts issued to the same owner by the same company during a single calendar year are required to be aggregated and treated as a single contract for purposes of determining the amount that is includible in income when a distribution occurs � the code provides special rules for the taxation of surrenders partial surrenders loans collateral assignments and other predeath distributions from modified endowment contracts��under these special rules such transactions are taxable to the extent that at the time of the transaction the cash value of the policy exceeds the investment in the contract generally the premiums paid for the policy��in addition a  tax penalty generally applies to the taxable portion of such distributions unless the policy owner is over age � or disabled or the distribution is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments as defined in the code � when the policy is life insurance that is not a modified endowment contract��if the policy is not issued as a modified endowment contract we will monitor premiums paid and will notify the policy owner when the policy is in jeopardy of becoming a modified endowment contract��if a policy is not a modified endowment contract a cash distribution during the first  years after a policy is issued that causes a reduction in death benefits may still become fully or partially taxable to the policy owner pursuant to section f of the code��you should carefully consider this potential tax ramification and seek further information before requesting any changes in the terms of the policy � distributions from life insurance contracts that are not modified endowment contracts generally are treated as being from the investment in the contract generally the premiums paid for the contract and then from the income in the contract��because premium payments are generally nondeductible distributions not in excess of investment in the contract are generally not includible in income instead they reduce the owner�s investment in the contract � however if a policy is not a modified endowment contract a cash distribution during the first  years after a policy is issued that causes a reduction in death benefits may still become fully or partially taxable to the policy owner pursuant to section f of the code��you should carefully consider this potential tax ramification and seek further information before requesting any changes in the terms of the policy � in addition a loan from a life insurance contract that is not a modified endowment contract is not taxable when made although it can be treated as a distribution if it is forgiven during the owner�s lifetime��distributions from contracts that are not modified endowment contracts are not subject to the  early distribution penalty tax � surrendering the policy � a full surrender cancellation of the policy by lapse or the maturity of the policy on its maturity date may have adverse tax consequences��if the amount you receive plus total policy indebtedness exceeds the investment in the contract generally the premiums paid into the policy then the excess generally will be treated as taxable ordinary income regardless of whether or not the policy is a modified endowment contract��in certain circumstances for example when the policy indebtedness is very large the amount of tax could exceed the amount distributed to you at surrender � withholding � distributions of income from a life insurance policy including a life insurance policy that is a modified endowment contract are subject to federal income tax withholding��generally the recipient may elect not to have the withholding taken from the distribution��we will withhold income tax unless you advise us in writing of your request not to withhold��if you request that taxes not be withheld or if the taxes withheld are insufficient you may be liable for payment of an estimated tax � a distribution of income from a life insurance policy may be subject to mandatory backup withholding��mandatory backup withholding means that we are required to withhold taxes on a distribution at the rate established by section  of the code and the recipient cannot elect to receive the entire distribution at once��mandatory backup withholding may arise if we have not been provided a taxpayer identification number or if the irs notifies us that backup withholding is required � in certain employersponsored life insurance arrangements participants may be required to report for income tax purposes �  � one or more of the following � ��� the value each year of the life insurance protection provided ��� an amount equal to any employerpaid premiums or ��� some or all of the amount by which the current value exceeds the employer�s interest in the policy or ��� interest that is deemed to have been forgiven on a loan that we deemed to have been made by the employer � participants in an employersponsored plan relating to this policy should consult with the sponsor or the administrator of the plan andor with their personal tax or legal advisor to determine the tax consequences if any of their employersponsored life insurance arrangements � exchanging the policy for another life insurance policy � generally you will pay taxes on amounts that you receive in excess of your premium payments when you completely surrender the policy��if however you exchange the policy for another life insurance policy modified endowment contract or annuity contract you will not be taxed on the excess amount if the exchange meets the requirements of code section ��to meet section  requirements the insured named in the policy must be the insured for the new policy or contract and the new policy or contract cannot extend the maturity date or otherwise delay a distribution that would extend the time that tax would be payable��generally the new policy or contract will be treated as having the same issue date and tax basis as the old policy or contract � if the policy or contract is subject to a policy indebtedness that is discharged as part of the exchange transaction the discharge of the indebtedness may be taxable��owners should consult with their personal tax or legal advisors in structuring any policy exchange transaction � taxation of death benefits � federal income tax��the death benefit is generally excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code��however if the policy is transferred to a new policy owner for valuable consideration a portion of the death benefit may be includable in the beneficiary�s gross income when it is paid � the payout option selected by your beneficiary may affect how the payments received by the beneficiary are taxed��under the various payout options the amount payable to the beneficiary may include earnings on the death benefit which will be taxable as ordinary income��for example if the beneficiary elects to receive interest only then the entire amount of the interest payment will be taxable to the beneficiary if a periodic payment whether for a fixed period or for life is selected then a portion of each payment will be taxable interest income and a portion will be treated as the nontaxable payment of the death benefit��your beneficiaries should consult with their tax advisors to determine the tax consequences of electing a payout option based on their individual circumstances special federal income tax considerations for life insurance policies owned by employers��in  president bush signed the pension protection act of  which contains new code sections j and i which affect the tax treatment of life insurance contracts owned by the employer of the insured��these provisions are generally effective for life insurance contracts issued after august  ��if a life insurance policy was issued on or before august   but materially modified after that date it will be treated as having been issued after that date for purposes of section j��contracts issued after august   pursuant to a section  exchange generally are excluded from the operation of these new provisions provided that the contract received in the exchange does not have a material increase in death benefit or other material change with respect to the old contract new section j provides the general rule that with respect to an employerowned life insurance contract the amount of death benefit payable directly or indirectly to the employer that may be excluded from income cannot exceed the sum of premiums and other payments paid by the policyholder for the contract��consequently under this general rule the entire death benefit less the cost to the policyholder will be taxable��although section j is not clear if lifetime distributions from the contract are made as a nontaxable return of premium it appears that the reduction would apply for section j purposes and reduce the amount of premiums for this purpose there are  exceptions to this general rule of taxability provided that statutory notice consent and information requirements are satisfied��these requirements are as follows��prior to the issuance by the company a the employee is notified in writing that the employer intends to insure the employees life and the maximum face amount for which the employee could be insured at the time that the contract is issued b the employee provides written consent to being insured under the contract and that such coverage may continue after the insured terminates employment and c the employee is informed in writing that the employer will be a beneficiary of any proceeds payable upon the death of the employee��if the employer fails to meet all of those requirements then neither exception can apply �  � the  exceptions are as follows��first if proper notice and consent are given and received and if the insured was an employee at any time during the month period before the insured�s death then new section j would not apply second if proper notice and consent are given and received and at the time that the contract is issued the insured is either a director a �highly compensated employee� within the meaning of section q of the code without regard to paragraph abii thereof or a �highly compensated individual� within the meaning of section h except �� is substituted for �� in paragraph c thereof then the new section j would not apply code section i requires any policyholder of an employerowned contract to file an annual return showing a the number of employees of the policyholder b the number of such employees insured under employeeowned contracts at the end of the year c the total amount of insurance in force with respect to those contracts at the end of the year d the name address taxpayer identification number and type of business of the policyholder and e that the policyholder has a valid consent for each insured or if all consents are not obtained the number of insured employees for whom such consent was not obtained��proper recordkeeping is also required by this section it is your responsibility to a provide the proper notice to each insured b obtain the proper consent from each insured c inform each insured in writing that you will be the beneficiary of any proceeds payable upon the death of the insured and d file the annual return required by section i��if you fail to provide the necessary notice and information or fail to obtain the necessary consent the death benefit will be taxable to you when received��if you fail to file a properly completed return under section i you could be required to pay a penalty � federal transfer taxes��when the insured dies the death benefit will generally be included in the insureds federal gross estate if  the proceeds were payable to or for the benefit of the insureds estate or  the insured held any incident of ownership in the policy at death or at any time within  years of death��an incident of ownership in general is any right that may be exercised by the policy owner such as the right to borrow on the policy or the right to name a new beneficiary � if the beneficiary is two or more generations younger than the insured the death benefit may be subject to the gstt��pursuant to regulations issued by the us secretary of the treasury we may be required to withhold a portion of the proceeds and pay them directly to the irs as the gstt payment � if the policy owner is not the insured or a beneficiary payment of the death benefit to the beneficiary will be treated as a gift to the beneficiary from the policy owner � terminal illness � certain distributions made under a policy on the life of a �terminally ill individual� or a �chronically ill individual� as those terms are defined in the code are treated as death proceeds��see �taxation of death benefits� above � special considerations for corporations � section  of the code imposes a number of limitations on the interest and other business deductions that may otherwise be available to businesses that own life insurance policies��in addition the premium paid by a business for a life insurance policy is not deductible as a business expense or otherwise if the business is directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy � for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt that may be imposed on corporations the death benefit from a life insurance policy even though excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes is included in adjusted current earnings for amt purposes��in addition although increases to the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy are generally excluded from gross income for normal income tax purposes such increases are included in adjusted current earnings for income tax purposes � due to the complexity of these rules and because they are affected by your facts and circumstances you should consult with legal and tax counsel and other competent advisors regarding these matters � federal appellate and trial courts have examined the economic substance of transactions involving life insurance policies owned by corporations��these cases involved relatively large loans against the policy�s cash value as well as tax deductions for the interest paid on the policy loans by the corporate policy owner to the insurance company��under the particular factual circumstances in these cases the courts determined that the corporate policy owners should not have taken tax deductions for the interest paid��accordingly the court determined that the corporations should have paid taxes on the amounts deducted��corporations should consider in consultation with tax professionals familiar with these matters the impact of these decisions on the corporation�s intended use of the policy � see also �business uses of the policy� below � taxes and the value of your policy � for federal income tax purposes a separate account is not a separate entity from the company��thus the tax status of the �  � separate account is not distinct from our status as a life insurance company��investment income and realized capital gains on the assets of the separate account are reinvested and taken into account in determining the value of accumulation units��as a result such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically applied to increase reserves under the policies � at present we do not expect to incur any federal income tax liability that would be chargeable to the accumulation units��based upon these expectations no charge is being made against your accumulation units for federal income taxes��if however we determine that taxes may be incurred we reserve the right to assess a charge for these taxes � we may also incur state and local taxes in addition to those described in the discussion of the premium taxes in several states��at present these taxes are not significant��if they increase however charges for such taxes may be made that would decrease the value of your accumulation units � business uses of the policy � the life insurance policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others��the tax consequences of these plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement��the irs has also recently issued new guidance on split dollar insurance plans��in addition internal revenue code section a which sets forth new rules for taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation was added to the code for deferrals after december  ��therefore if you are contemplating using the policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should be sure to consult a tax advisor as to tax attributes of the arrangement � nonresident aliens and other persons who are not citizens of the united states � special income tax laws and rules apply to nonresident aliens of the united states including certain withholding requirements with respect to predeath distributions from the policy��in addition foreign law may impose additional taxes on the policy the death benefit or other distributions andor ownership of the policy � in addition special gift estate and gstt laws and rules may apply to nonresident aliens and to transfers to persons who are not citizens of the united states including limitations on the marital deduction if the surviving or donee spouse is not a citizen of the united states � if you are a nonresident alien or a resident alien or if any of your beneficiaries including your spouse are not citizens of the united states you should confer with a competent tax professional with respect to the tax treatment of this policy � if you the insured the beneficiary or other person receiving any benefit or interest in or from the policy are not both a resident and citizen of the united states there may be a tax imposed by a foreign country that is in addition to any tax imposed by the united states��the foreign law including regulations rulings treatiers with the united states and case law may change and impose additional or increased taxes on the policy payment of the death benefit or other distributions andor ownership of the policy � tax changes � the foregoing discussion which is based on our understanding of federal tax laws as currently interpreted by the irs is general and is not intended as tax advice � the code has been subjected to numerous amendments and changes and it is reasonable to believe that it will continue to be revised��the united states congress has in the past considered numerous legislative proposals that if enacted could change the tax treatment of life insurance policies��it is reasonable to believe that such proposals and future proposals may be enacted into law��the us treasury department may amend existing regulations issue new regulations or adopt new interpretations of existing law that may be differ from its current positions on these matters��in addition current state law which is not discussed herein and future amendments to state law may affect the tax consequences of the policy � in  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  egtrra was enacted into law��egtrra contained numerous changes to the federal income gift estate and generation skipping transfer taxes many of which are not scheduled to become effective until a future date��among other matters egtrra provides for the repeal of the federal estate and generationskipping transfer taxes after  however unless congress and the president enact additional legislation egtrra also provides that all of those changes will sunset after  and the estate and generation skipping transfer taxes will be reinstated as if egtrra had never been enacted � the foregoing is a general explanation as to certain tax matters pertaining to insurance policies��it is not intended to be legal or tax advice��you should consult your independent legal tax andor financial advisor � any or all of the foregoing may change from time to time without any notice and the tax consequences arising out of a policy may be changed retroactively��there is no way of predicting if when or to what extent any such change may take place��we make no representation as to the likelihood of the continuation of these current laws

this group includes nationwide financial network nfn an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base nfs is incorporated in delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in columbus ohio the company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates these matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigation matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases

the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company believes however that based on currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys condensed consolidated financial position nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the companys condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period the various

one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve

transfer fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed inkind transactions likewise section b applicants represent that trusts board of trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by rule ae and f the application also states “pursuant to rule ae during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any inkind
