not traded in another currency but instead in percent the investor does not purchase a quantity of bonds but instead a particular nominal amount the nominal value is the price at which the bond is to be repaid the coupon shows the interest that the respective bond yields the issuer of the bond takes out a loan on the capital market and therefore owes a debt to the purchaser of the bond purchasers of bonds consequently have a claim against the issuer for this reason bonds are also referred to as bonds or debt securities the credit terms for bonds such as the rate of return term and redemption are defined precisely in advance bonds are traded on the bond market home  bonds follow us on also check out sp stocks all  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z dow jones gold price oil

not traded in another currency but instead in percent the investor does not purchase a quantity of bonds but instead a particular nominal amount the nominal value is the price at which the bond is to be repaid the coupon shows the interest that the respective bond yields the issuer of the bond takes out a loan on the capital market and therefore owes a debt to the purchaser of the bond purchasers of bonds consequently have a claim against the issuer for this reason bonds are also referred to as bonds or debt securities the credit terms for bonds such as the rate of return term and redemption are defined precisely in advance bonds are traded on the bond market home  bonds follow us on also check out sp stocks all  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z dow jones gold price oil
