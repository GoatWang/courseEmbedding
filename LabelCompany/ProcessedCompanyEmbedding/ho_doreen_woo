lounge says drop dead by tyler durden nov    pm  shares october  message from doreen woo ho ceo of united commercial bank dear valued customer as ucb’s acting president and ceo one of my top priorities is to keep our customers updated on important developments at the bank  over the last several weeks we have made significant strides in our effort to turn the page and start a “new chapter” in ucb’s history  we are working closely with our regulators to make the bank stronger for the benefit of our customers and other stakeholders in the us and china  let me briefly summarize the progress we have made in the past few weeks partnership with china minsheng bank i recently returned from china where i met with the board and management of our strategic investor china minsheng bank cmbc  they expressed their continued support of ucb and interest in working together on strategic initiatives and other business synergies currently a group of  young managers from cmbc are visiting our san francisco headquarters where they are spending six weeks undergoing both classroom and practical training in various departments of the bank  this collaboration has helped members of both banks deepen our understanding of each other’s business and will help us find new ways to enhance ucb’s highvalue products and services capital plan we are focused on addressing our capital needs going forward as we announced in our press release on september   to that end we are aggressively moving forward with our capital plan and have engaged a financial advisor to help us look at all our options  as soon as we have something specific to disclose we will communicate it publicly to all our customers and other stakeholders financial restatement  management action plan in the last few weeks we have aligned our team with our outside auditors at kpmg to work as expeditiously as possible to complete our financial restatement the entire management team is doing its utmost as are our auditors to move the bank forward and put us back on a solid foundation for the future community support while we are working hard to move the bank forward all of us at ucb continue to partner with members of our communities in the us and in the greater china region to meet the banking needs of our customers in all of the regions we serve  two examples stand out in boston ucb recently helped chinatown main street a publicprivate initiative between the city of boston and the national trust of historical preservation open an account at our boston chinatown branch to help them support funding of the “ master plan of chinatown”  ucb has been a partner with chinatown main street in hosting the street festivals to celebrate chinese new year and autumn moon festival in boston’s chinatown for many years at a recent ucb community dinner in san francisco’s chinatown more than  chinese community leaders and representatives of civic and nonprofit organizations in the bay area were joined by former san francisco mayor willie brown president of the sf board of supervisors david chiu and fremont mayor bob wasserman many of the attendees had great stories to share about the ways in which ucb has been there for the san francisco community over the years  gordon chin executive director of chinatown community development center mentioned that ucb provides muchneeded funding and loans to help build the local community and improve quality of life for residents  kinson wong owner of rg lounge one of the most popular and well known chinese restaurants in the san francisco bay area shared with everyone that the bank helped him expand his business in the past  years by providing him with several rounds of financing i know i speak for all ucb associates in saying that we are very proud of this heritage and the relationships we have developed with our customers and leaders in all the communities we serve finally i want to emphasize that united commercial bank is committed to the highest standards of integrity and transparency in all aspects of our business thank you for your continued confidence in us  as always if you have any questions or comments please call us at  or email us at commentsunitedcbcom sincerely doreen woo ho     fast forward to november   east west bank pasadena california assumes all the deposits of united commercial bank san

hit the iceberg and are going down its getting entirely too predictable tell us everything sucks and maybe well believe you anonymous cbxer nov    pm better question why is lying to shareholders not being punished with  fines  prevention from ever holding office at a publicly traded company ever again instead ceos float off with the golden parachute claw that shit back tom a taxpayer nov    am excellent point anon sheila dont worry be happy bair fdic should be disbarring woo ho from all fdicinsured institutions daddywarbucks nov    am bullseye anonymous cbxer nov    pm it is because they and their fellow americans are congenital liars cognitive dissonance nov    am we humans are trained conditioned our entire life to avoid unpleasant truths by our culture society government corporations and family members in short it permeates everything we do and everywhere we go this practice of avoidance becomes internalized and the only way to conduct our daily affairs it is all we know and the only way we see both the world and our part in it  i often read how anger or love are the most powerful emotions while true on its face one can not remain in a constant state of anger or love these emotions rise and fall during the waking day denial however is always present and the unconscious the ego is forever vigilant in deflecting modifying or obscuring any information that might wake us to reality pretty powerful stuff i see lies as the outcome of mostly conscious decisions when lies and lying becomes automatic and consistent it is better described as denial the actual process of being in denial is almost always an unconscious act and thus far more pervasive and overpowering than simple lies we rarely recognize we are in denial while we almost always know we are lying im not splitting hairs the posters says we americans are congenital liars i submit that humans are congenital deniers and we americans have taken our denial to an extreme beyond what is considered normal and squarely into the danger zone not only to ourselves but to others around the world of course when a entity is in severe denial such as a person addicted to drugs or a country addicted to credit what often happens is the rest of the family becomes quite dysfunctional when dealing with the addict either by denying the issues themselves or even helping the addict maintain some normalcy to the point where their world is pulled into the abyss along with the addict i do not know which country the poster hails from but may i suggest that your country as well as many others have been supplying we americans with our drug of choice for far too long in fact you have become users as well though we can quibble over the degree and precisely when our addiction has flared to enormous proportions and we should be cut off from our drug our supply seems to have ballooned as well and not just from our own production it seems that we congenital liars have become the proverbial to big to fail country and you have become fellow users and even enablers welcome to the crazy train fellow congenital liar nice to have you aboard please settle down find a seat and fasten your seat belt because youre in for a wild ride you have entered the twilight zone  winisk cognitive dissonance nov    am if the us is the too big to fail country which i agree it is then the logical conclusion will be to break up the good ol usa  toot toot cognitive dissonance winisk nov    am that in my view is the inevitable and logical answer to the insanity we are currently practicing once you reach that conclusion the only question that remains is will the dismantling be done from within or without our too big to fail country sgtdoom cognitive dissonance nov    pm a brilliant post cd and nothing can be added but stating that i feel as a cof crusty old fart i must mention what also has appeared selfevident to me as an american  too many americans appear to be raised or grow up believing in obeying authority and their authority to be obeyed is the tv balkanization to the max cognitive dissonance sgtdoom nov    pm once we recognize that we have been and remain conditioned no small feat because it requires us to recognize our own denial then the discussion must turn to the methods used for the conditioning and of course who determines the conditioning received while i wont afflict you with a long explanation of my views on the various different methods that can and have been used i ask that you think about the following as a fellow cof i remember as a younger man very public discussions concerning the practice of inserting subliminal messages into that new and wonderful form of communication called television and then the entire subject disappeared from public view after a very concerned population was vigorously assured that the government would ban the practice and closely monitor the public airwaves for its illegal use while it pops back to the front of public consciousness every now and then its rapidly buried after extremely limited discussion of particular note is the recent  presidential campaign cycle where both the obama and mccain campaigns were caught using subliminal messages in their ads which were amusingly labeled a mistake or in error and quickly removed from the air waves or so we were told one simply doesnt in error place subliminal messages in a television ad in the same way an embarrassing moment is caught during a live broadcast or the producers fail to notice something left in the background of a commercial only to have it discovered by the viewing public subliminal messages come about from deliberate overt acts that require planning and execution no mistake that i can work out would place one in a commercial advertisement or tv program in error they arent stored high up on a shelf from which one becomes jostled and falls into the commercial oops my bad now what do i do damn i hope no one notices because i dont want to waste my time digging that subliminal message out now that the commercial is finished i watch very little tv myself anymore but i still find myself slack jawed and essentially brain dead after  or more minutes of watching popular prime time tv ive talked to dozens of other people about this phenomenon and once i bring it to their attention almost everyone has reported back to me that the same thing happens to them they often become engrossed and mindless dazed was the way one friend wonderfully described it without recognizing its happening even if there is an innocent explanation for this and ive spent a great deal of time attempting to disprove my theory that subliminal messages are an integral part of tv the effect is still the same the american public has effectively been pacified and indoctrinated by tv over the past  years  all hail the idiot box milbank cognitive dissonance nov    am thank you joyce brothers now get a rope and hang her hang her high cocoablini nov
