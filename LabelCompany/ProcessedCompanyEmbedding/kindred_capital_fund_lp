company life and culture kindred spirits  our investment in founder collective  feld thoughts press enter to search archive marathons books about legal back to top march   kindred spirits – our investment in founder collective foundry group is best known for our investments in startups but our vehicle currently investing in other venture funds foundry group next is off to what we believe to be a great start and i wanted to share an update about it by talking about our new investment in a fund managed by founder collective i’ve written previously about why we created foundry group next we have been personally investing as lps in funds of other managers for decades and found the activity to be emotionally rewarding when we decided we wanted to expand and formalize that activity it gave us a chance to work more closely with lindel eakman who was the largest investor in our first fund through his role at utimco lindel joined foundry group as a partner to lead the fund investing activity of foundry group next we’ve made about a dozen investments in funds including funds offered by union square ventures true ventures and forerunner ventures one of our recent investments offered by founder collective fc – an eightyearold manager with offices in boston and san francisco – is an excellent example of what we look for when we invest in funds offered by other managers it starts with the people we don’t invest in managers unless we can picture working with them for decades we’ve had the opportunity to work with founder collective’s partners – david frankel eric paley and micah rosenbloom – over the years on several companies we also know many of the entrepreneurs in their portfolio from those founders we are aware that fc takes their mission “to be the most aligned fund to founders at the seed stage” very seriously we aren’t a generational firm but investing in other vc funds gives us the benefit of working with managers who challenge and enhance our thinking while sharing the lessons we’ve learned with other investors we want to work with people who bring a focused and complementary perspective to investing and were interested in the founder collective mantra of being “stagefocused and sector agnostic” this means fc avoids trends and relentlessly questions entrepreneurs about how their product enables specific use cases and market opportunities this approach has paid off and helped the team to identify hot sectors well outside of the current hype cycle if you look at the founder collective portfolio you’ll see many wellrecognized companies that they invested in at the very first round in general these investments were rarely competitive at the time of their first financing “founder friendly” is an overused term but there is a big difference between marketing this as a concept and living it every day the team at fc has structurally designed their firm around alignment to founders they’re a rare venture fund that doesn’t exercise prorata rights over the lifetime of an investment meaning they dilute alongside company founders which they believe better aligns their interests as seed investors with the entrepreneurs at a time where funds are aggressively deploying capital and not considering the downsides for founders fc is actively promoting the value of efficient entrepreneurship and helping founders maximize their outcomes and optionality not only are the downsides of overcapitalization problematic for founders but fc also examined overcapitalization in upside scenarios by studying the data from the last five years of tech ipos the findings were surprising in that the amount of money a company raised and its success in the public markets were not positively correlated in fact the companies that raised less money outperformed the most funded over time needless to say having investors that keep this balance in mind can be precious to founders it’s one thing to have a unique perspective it’s another to generate returns with it as an lp i’ve had the good fortune to be an investor in many funds including some exceptional ones before diving into diligence we had a sense that founder collective had strong performance based on their portfolio when we saw their financial track record we realized how special the performance was we know many firms that build portfolios with great logos by buying into companies at later stages and higher valuations fc’s portfolio is made up exclusively of seed stage investments at seed valuations these aren’t just paper gains – they have already returned a meaningful amount of cash to their investors founder collective’s first fund has the potential to be enshrined in the annals of vc history their second fund is tracking ahead of the first at the same point in development needless to say we had many reasons to hope to be part of their third fund the only problem was they didn’t have any room we found out they were oversubscribed just from their existing fund ii investors – that’s without pitching any new lps but they didn’t take advantage of that demand instead they stuck to their principles and kept their fund size the same as their previous fund we love seeing that strategy discipline as we believe it is the mark of good fund managers when union square ventures’  fund was on fire fred and brad raised their next fund at the same size this has also been our approach at foundry group in the case of founder collective the partners effectively shrunk their fund regarding outside capital by increasing their personal financial commitment to their fund this investment generates additional evidence that they are confident in their strategy while creating more alignment with their lps as a gp i applauded the approach and accepted that as an lp we had to beg and plead our way into to the fund all the same we were honored that foundry group next was the only new investor in founder collective iii due to our long and trusted relationship by virtue of time and focus we can only help so many startups but we’re proud to be investors in funds like founder collective which is deeply committed to helping enrich the startup ecosystem we are delighted to be working alongside them and finding other managers of their caliber going forward also published on medium darius v congrats not asking for pro rata nicely aligns investors and founders also solid point about keeping financially responsible and not being addicted to outside capital for all growth for founders mario cantin “i applauded the approach and accepted that as an lp we had to beg and plead our way into to the fund” how did they make room for fg next then i assume they kept the fund size the same so did they put in less of their own capital into the new fund or did they leave out one or more of their fund  lps also what do you fundamentally think of their “cultural” decision to forego pro rata do you think it is a strategy that works for them as an aberration or do you think the approach should gain momentum as a new “movement” for a new generation of vcs in the future bfeld they put more of their personal capital in the fund they cut back a few other lps to make room for us i love their view on prorata it’s how i’ve always approached my angel investing i don’t think it’s a new “movement” rather it’s one of the strategic approaches see  have a financial strategy in httpsfeldcomarchivessuggestionsforangelinvestorshtml mario cantin i was asking because until now i had only heard either david frankel or eric paley mention in a podcast that founders collective doesn’t believe in pro rata while everyone else in vc from what i hear — not angel — “has” to take pro rata it seems as one of the tools with which to make their funds perform and so i was wondering whether this could become a trend but i’ll guess that once you reach series a you have to take pro rata and so this founder alignment philosophy could only realistically work for angel preseed and seed until fund economics dictate otherwise for the larger rounds am i close bfeld the assumption or assertion that “everyone has to take prorata” isn’t correct in recent years it’s become all the rage again but there are different strategies around it the key thing is to be clear on your strategy mario cantin thank you if the occasion presents itself when you are being interviewed in the future — or when you write on your blog — to elaborate on this well know that there is at least one person interested to know more me and perhaps there are others when i hear fred wilson’s stance on this point just to name one individual well good luck on taking pro rata away from him that’s all i can say it’s an incessant barrage of “i wish we could have doubledown on uber or twitter” etc i continually hear or read about i’ve been following you and others for years now and i can’t recall the alternatives being discussed it’s an interesting topic bfeld yeah – probably worth me writing more about it again … scott lobo dont understand this site httpswwwsecondloanscom twitter facebook linkedin google kindred capital llc  financial services firm  brightscope
