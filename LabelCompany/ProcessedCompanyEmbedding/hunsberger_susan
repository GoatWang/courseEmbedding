went into servicemaster global holdings inc’s decision to relocate to downtown memphis and one factor that weighed heavily on that choice was the company’s staff view slideshow  photos a year after servicemaster first announced it would relocate to downtown memphis the… more susan hunsberger senior vice president of human resources for servicemaster said any time a company relocates it loses talent “by staying here you minimize the disruption to the business you provide great opportunities for your employees that are here and reinforce the message that memphis is where we want to be — it’s a stabilizing factor” hunsberger said “people know you are going to be here they know that you are obviously doing well … that you are growing we are undergoing a culture change and just pivoting from a suburban location to an urban location was something we really weren’t going to be able to do in these other locations outside of memphis so being urban being part of the memphis revitalization being able to keep our brain trust of employees that was something that all worked out for us” servicemaster which includes the american home shield amerispec furniture medic merry maids servicemaster clean servicemaster restore and terminix brands announced in june  its plans to stay in memphis and move from its current ridge lake boulevard properties in east memphis to the vacant peabody place mall a year later the company’s innovation center ground floor at servicemaster opened in the former tower records space at peabody place the innovation center —  square feet of the more than

identify items they would like to see in a new work environment these groups which hunsberger said serve as ambassadors to the rest of the employees helped familiarize staffers with downtown and kept everyone updated on the headquarters progress hunsberger said a move downtown — even if it is in the same city — is still a big deal for people which is why the company wanted to ensure everyone is prepared longterm she said the relocation should be a key asset for recruitment “we know this is a trend across the country” hunsberger said “people want to be at the center of action they want to be able to walk to work walk to restaurants walk to entertainment and i think just by being more contemporary and inline with what people want we will become a very attractive employer to people that maybe wouldn’t have before because they like the urban environment and they can see us every day we will be front and center there” memphisbased public companies ranked by most recent fiscal year
