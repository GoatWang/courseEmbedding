billion behemoth hes just spent almost  billion to get into an entirely new business can this decades most unlikely tech startup beat nike by tom foster tom foster is an inc editoratlarge his work has also appeared in popular science fast company details and mens journal among others a longtime new yorker he is a recent transplant to austin tomfoster editoratlarge inctomfoster  comments former college football player turned sportswear entrepreneur kevin plank is betting that fitness trackers and apps will help under armour beat nike it’s a tall order but don’t underestimate what this guy and his whiteboards can accomplish credit dylan coulter have you seen kevins whiteboards if you spend any time at under armour headquarters youll hear that question again and again founder and ceo kevin plank really likes whiteboards and his favorite use for them is to write out leadership maxims for his team inside and outside his office whole walls of floortoceiling whiteboards contain dozens of curt principles hes scrawled over the years expedite the inevitable perfection is the enemy of innovation respect everyone fear no one these commandments are meant not as simple inspiration or hard rules he says but together make up a system of guardrails that allow everyone under him to operate as entrepreneurs by channeling his thinking the plank principles are drilled into new employees during a weeklong orientation and theyre painted all over the hallways at company headquarters a former procter  gamble factory on the baltimore waterfront think like an entrepreneur create like an innovator perform like a teammate plank has the affect and intensity of a head coachdirect eye contact military analogies the air of someone you do not want to disappoint winning is a part of our cultureits who we are he says in his lofty office overlooking the harbor the only artwork behind his desk a giant ua logo its letters stacked to evoke arms raised in victory and culture is formed on habits perhaps the most important guardrail and the companys official mission is seeking to make all athletes better it has long equaled thinking about clothes as highperformance gear but recently its taken on a big new meaning over the past two years under armour has spent close to  billion buying and investing in three leading makers of activity and diettracking mobile apps by doing so the company has amassed the worlds largest digital healthandfitness community with  million users plank envisions all of those users and their metrics as a big data engine to drive everything from product development to merchandising to marketing many observers though balked at the  million cost of the acquisitions questioning whether under armour could quickly produce any return on investmenttwo of the three companies were unprofitablelet alone succeed in a space that shares little with making shirts and shoes longtime staffers worried the moves would crimp company performance affect bonuses or divert focus from the core business plank spent more hours than he cares to count including a large chunk of his winter vacation last year in oneonone conversations to persuade them otherwise it was important he says that this not just be my decision under armour teamsports designers discussing concepts for uniforms and performance gear theyre making for planks alma mater the university of marylandimage jared soarescredit jared soares plank likes to say that the key to under armours success is that he never focused on all the reasons it couldnt happen a former division  college football player plank famously bootstrapped under armours launch in 99 armed with one simple insight the cotton undershirts football players wore under their pads slowed them down when they became soaked with sweat after prototyping a moisturewicking formfitting alternativemade of fabric for womens undergarmentsand testing it on exteammates plank set up shop in his grandmothers basement and just before he went broke scored his first big sale to georgia tech the company went on to create a whole new market for performance apparel ipod in  and now sponsors some of the worlds greatest athletes including jordan spieth stephen curry and lindsey vonn today under armour has  employees around the world and nearly  billion in revenue but plank is still every bit the entrepreneur chasing audacious dreamschief among them overtaking nike as the worlds largest sportswear maker under armour leapfrogged the longtime number two adidas in the us sportswear market in  but worldwide its still third and nike remains far larger with more than  billion in revenue in  which is part of why plank wants to move so aggressively nike has about a fifth as many users on its nike platform as under armour does on its apps and in  the shoe giant shut down its fuelband fitnesstracker business the real work is only beginning though as plank has adopted the kind of worldchanging ambitions more common to a google or facebook he envisions that under armour connected fitness will fundamentally affect global health this monthdoubters be damnedthe company will start selling a pair of biometric fitness devices and a smart scale made in partnership with the taiwanese smartphone company htc the move will put plank in direct competition with fitbit and apple in the fastgrowing wearables market its a bold characteristically plankian betand a very risky one says morningstar retail analyst paul swinand morningstar and inc are both owned by joe mansueto under armour has been a phenomenal success story swinand says its stock has risen steadilyalmost  percent in the decade since its ipo but when youre hitting a home run every quarter on the core apparel business why mess around with a moon shot plank rarely admits to much uncertainty or doubt so its telling that he echoes swinand in describing connected fitnesss ambitions as a moon shot but another of his whiteboard sayings comes to mind this one courtesy of his friend and former us special operations commander admiral eric olson nobody ever won a horserace by yelling whoa robin thurston cofounder and then ceo of austinbased app maker mapmy­fitness got his first taste of planks highspeed forceofwill approach when the under armour founder coldcalled him in july  plank explained that he loved thurstons app mapmyrun i run five miles three times a week i log everything i look up routes when i travel plank began what are you doing with the company thurston replied that he was about to raise more venture capital to pursue ambitious expansion plans the company had bought several hundred domains based on every physical activity and planned to launch new products for each thurston and his investors saw mapmyfitness as poised to become the leading digital healthandfitness network dont do that plank shot back come talk to me instead a couple of weeks later plank and three key lieutenants showed up early at the new york city offices of  allen  company where thurston and his team were huddling with their bankers the mapmyfitness team got about  minutes into a detailed powerpoint presentation when plank interrupted this is awesome he said but i want to stop you and go talk to robin myself for a few minuteswithout any bankers running interference forty minutes later plank and thurston returned and plank asked the mapmyfitness team if theyd like to go to baltimore right away to check out the under armour campus it wasnt  am when the groupalong with nfl veteran and sports­caster boomer esiason whod been waiting at the airport to hitch a ride on planks jetpulled up at under armour headquarters former washington redskin lavar arrington opened thurstons door and offered a tour of the campus as well as some oatmeal cookies to the stunned app makers within two weeks the parties had agreed that under armour would acquire the startup for  million and thurston would remain atop mapmy­fitness and become under armours chief digital officer thurston a onetime professional cyclist who maintained mapmyfitnesss position as a top fitness app from the iphones earliest days tells the story in his new office in downtown austin in a brandnew building where giant images of under armour athletes adorn the walls amid of course motivational mantras and several hundred new engineers and other tech employees work at first thurston says under armours interest was a puzzler hed entertained partnering with insurance companies and media companies but he always worried theyd exploit all the data mapmyfitness gathers about peoples personal habits in ways that would violate the trust hed built with the community under armour had simply never occurred to him as a home for his company but the first thing plank did in that private meeting in new york was pull up a concept video under armour had created earlier that year called future girl it showed a young woman starting a morning workout in clothes that were touchsensitive and could call up data displays and even change color with the tap of a finger i made this for you plank said to thurston in truth it had run as a tv commercial plank told me it was made for someone like robin even though i didnt know who robin would be he wanted to be sure that thurston wouldnt bolt after the sale but would instead see an exciting opportunity and lead it under armour had always been a tech company in its way plank explainedbut it had struggled with digital at under armour headquarters workers breaks often involve workouts like this one on an artificialturf field overlooking baltimores inner harborimage jared soarescredit jared soares none of the products in the future girl video existed thenand a variation of one is hitting the market nowbut merging performance products with performance data and inter­active technology was a top under armour priority given planks instinct that thats where the world was going plank had directed a team several years earlier to create an electric product and theyd come up with the e compression shirt which had sensors embedded in the fabric to track an athletes heart rate the shirt launched at the  nfl training combine to much fanfare but a simplified consumer versiona sensorequipped chest band­had only niche appeal that experience made plank realize under armour couldnt compete with hardware companies that employ thousands of engineers and constantly turn out incremental innovations its absurd that you know more about your car than you know about your body says plank hes betting athletes personal data will turbocharge their fitness and under armours future its very normal for a product companywhich is really what under armour isto have gone down the path of trying to create hardware says thurston they know the distribution channels they know how to sell products they know how to market them but as they started doing their homework on what was happening in the space they realized that the strength of digital fitness was actually in the community plank also knew it would take years to build a community like thurstons it wasnt that i didnt know the right answers to be seeking from engineers i didnt even know the right questions to ask plank admits im a sporting goods guy after the mapmyfitness acquisition closed in late  plank and thurston proceeded uncharacteristically slowly taking time to set priorities for under armours digital transformation thurston identified four key pillars of healthsleep fitness activity and nutritionthat he based on planks make all athletes better mission once that vision snapped into focus plank saw an opportunity not just to be a collector of human activity data but also to be the central processor that turns that dataregardless of whose device or app collected itinto useful insights ok lets do it he told thurston one day in late  by the following march they had spent more than half a billion dollars acquiring two more companies san franciscobased myfitnesspal a nutritiontracking system for people to log their meals and copenhagenbased endomondo a personaltraining program whose users are almost entirely outside the us under armour suddenly had not only the worlds largest digital fitness community but hundreds of engineers and reams of user data as well just one big question loomed how would any of that help under armour chip away at nikes dominance or at least sell a lot more workout shirts across the railroad tracks from the under armour campus a low redbrick building houses the companys innovation lab where president of product and innovation kevin haley leads a team of biomechanists designers engineers and a psychologist to develop shoe and apparel concepts there are weather chambers to recreate different exercise scenarios devices that stretch and compress materials gaitanalysis systems washers and dryers d printers laser cutters and countless other machines the deeper you go into the long narrow lab space the more secretive the operations the prototyping room is locked down from all but a few select employees and executives who must pass a biometric scanner to enter before taking over the innovation lab haley created the under armour consumer insights department early on the secret of our success was that we were the consumer haley says kevin was a football player he just knew but slowly we got older than our consumer the company stopped bragging about not using focus groups and started tapping its sponsored athletes for product insights sending researchers to look in peoples closets and running online surveys what under armour didnt know with much precision though was how people used its products after buying them you just know if a person swipes a credit card or not as haley puts itand even that only happens a couple of times a year for any customer we call something a basketball shirt but is the guy wearing it to football practice is the boyfriend shirt he gives to his girlfriend something she wears as pajamas but armed with data from connected fitness apps haley says he can take design cues from  million people who having downloaded a fitness app are exactly the target audience theres unbelievable data in there you know their running pace how far they go how often they go you literally know what brand of greek yogurt they use its too early to see many new products as a result of all the new datadeveloping a piece of gear typically takes  monthsbut haley points to one the company learned from mapmyfitness data that the average run is  milesnot one or two miles not five miles but  haley says so when it came to making the speedform gemini running shoe which was released last january to largely rave reviews the company added charged foam padding tailored to that kind of run the toughest question for us is not are there cool technologies out there says haley its what do you want me to work on this gives us unbelievable insight thats both incredibly broad and deep with the same group of people were marketing toward that could be especially helpful in the two huge growth opportunities for under armour more than  percent of connected fitnesss users are women who account for just  percent of under armours apparel sales and while only about  percent of its sales are international  percent of the connected community is outside the us still the highstakes bet on connected fitness will be slow to pay off under armour recently increased its projections for the next two years estimating that it would nearly double net revenue by  to  billion up from a previous estimate of  billion only  milliona paltry  percentwill come from connected fitness but thurston likens his digital community to having a super bowlsize audience every day and one of the most immediately practical moves will be using those apps as a marketing channel a feature called  gear tracker for instance allows mapmyfitness users to log the shoes they use every time they go running and get a reminder when their mileage suggests its time to buy new ones a partnership with zappos makes ordering replacements easy these components  clockwise from top the ua scale the ua band and the ua heart rate  make up the first new connected fitness product the health boximage jared soarescredit jared soares imagine youre traveling in chicago for work plank says you went for a run one morning and you had a cold the day before its  degrees in chicago so i know your nose was probably running the whole time well we make this great run glovewe call it the snot finger glove because its got basically a microfiber personal kleenex attached to it so you can rub your nose imagine if i could send you an ad that says hey are you going to be in chicago for another day would you like us to send you a pair of gloves chris glode a key digital executive for the company told a conference last year that the company has learned that consumers are  percent more receptive to fitness messages after a workoutso an ad could hit you right as you log your run the average underarmourcom order coming via a connected fitness app is  percent higher than those from other external sources the company says so one big priority is to build ecommerce into the apps if it all sounds eerily like those ads that because of your browsing history follow you around the internet thats exactly the pointexcept under armour is tracking real behavior and the data is more specific everyone in the company says personal data mining will give customers better fitness insights and better shirts and shoesso they become better athletes another way to look at it is that making people better athletes makes them need more gear as plank told analysts last july ultimately the more people exercise the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy i love monopoly plank tells me you know why when i play monopoly with you im going to buy everything from baltic avenue to marvin gardens if you get to my side of the board youd better roll boxcars or youre going to pay rent hes trying to describe why buying mapmyfitness was never going to be enough the real opportunities would come only if he controlled every part of the digital health experience even if nutrition say has only tangential relevance to the sportswear business if youre trying to truly understand athletes you need to see what they do  hours a day its absurd that you know more about your car than you know about your body says plank hence an app called ua record a kind of overall health dashboard that relaunches this month in conjunction with the cobranded htc devicesa fitbitlike wrist strap a chestworn heartrate monitor and a connected scale all sleek black and knobby red plastic with scoreboardinspired readouts record is an open platform for people to process their fitness data from any device and record exec glode calls it the ultimate digital expression of under armour plank gets especially animated talking about the relaunch of record and the related devices which will be sold together under the name health box itll be the first time users get to experience his full vision and its where he sees the potential to affect global health roughly one in five americans has downloaded one of planks apps plank has said so he wants not only to help users keep track of their running times or weight loss but also to compare their data with that of millions of other people like them and offer valuable insights whether the system sounds ingeniously simple or a bit too clever for its own good may depend on your dedication to fitness to plank its the former of course its like i wake up in the morning my wearable device tells me how long i slept and data point one beams to the cloud i go to the bathroom and step on the scale and data point two beams to the cloud im going to exercise so i put on my heartrate strap and data point three beams to the cloud and as i walk around all day the fitness tracker beams how many steps i take finally what did i eat for the day if i want to go deep into myfitnesspal and track everything great but if not i just answer if i had a light or average or heavy day i am the opposite of a moderate man reads one key plankism scrawled on a company whiteboard this is where it gets really exciting plank says and launches into a series of scenarios if you are ill one day in october you might learn that you get sick around the same time every year and that it correlates with your sleep or diet patterns or any number of patterns that you share with others your age and of similar height and weight if you go to the doctor all that information might be a lot more useful than the handscrawled note the physician has from your last visit  months ago and a couple of basic measurements the nurse took a few minutes earlier nobody owns this says plank and im sitting here thinking who should humana cvs youre going to trust them with your data why not us fair enough says morningstars swinand but he questions whether under armour can win that battle when the competition includes fitbit apple and even google the way tech works is you have four companies three end up zeros and the one that wins wins everything he raises the possibility that under armour could end up the myspace of fitness techand expresses concern about the recent departure of longtime coo and cfo brad dickerson i think brad was the voice of reason and kevin is the flamboyant entrepreneur swinand says plank likes his chances in part because the wide appeal of under armours lockerroom aesthetic and barking brand voice could transfer to any number of connected products think future girl but also because he now has more fitness data about users than even the leading tech companies if im right he says connected fitness becomes a force multiplier that takes us from shirtsandshoes company to true technology company if im wrong it costs us some moneywe have  million on the table a flicker of doubt from the unflappable plank no the one thing we know he concludes is we can always make more money he didnt need to point out another whiteboard commandmentthe one that reads dont forget to sell shirts and shoes from the february  issue of inc magazine recommended slideshow
