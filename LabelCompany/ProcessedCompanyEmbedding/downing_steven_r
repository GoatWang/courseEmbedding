when compared with the same quarter in read morethe gross profit margin in the first quarter of  was  compared with a gross profit margin of  in the first quarter of  the quarteroverquarter net decrease in the gross profit margin was the result of annual customer price reductions which was partially offset by purchasing cost reductions and favorable product mixoperating income for the first quarter of  increased  to  million when compared to operating income of  million for the first quarter of  other income increased to  million in the first quarter of  compared with a loss of  million

the first quarter  financial detailskevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting thank you steve automotive net sales in the first quarter of  were  million an increase of  compared with automotive net sales of  million in the first quarter of  driven by a  increase in autodimming mirror unit shipments on a quarteroverquarter basis other net sales in the first quarter which included dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products were  million compared to other sales of  million in the first quarter of operating expenses increased by  during the first quarter of  to  million due to staffing increased travel and overseas office expenses the company continues to estimate that its operating expenses will be between  million and  million for calendar year as steve mentioned the tax rate during the first quarter of  was  which varied from the statutory rate of  due to the domestic manufacturing deduction as well as the favorable discrete items mentioned earlier excluding future impacts of the standard mentioned the company continues to expect its tax rate to be approximately  to  for calendar year  however the new standard will cause variability in the companys effective tax rate going forward depending on employee stock option exercise activity and the common stock pricenow for some balance sheet items the following balance sheet items represent a comparison versus december   which is also included in todays press releasecash and cash equivalents were  million an increase of  million from  million primarily due to cash flow from operations net

depreciation and amortization expense for the calendar year will be between  million and  millionand i will now hand over the call to neil boehm for a product and technology updateneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering thank you kevin to begin we would like to provide an update on our full display mirror launches as weve discussed previously general motors was our launch customer for this brand new technology and through the fourth quarter of  our full display mirror product was available on  different nameplates in the gm lineup recently gm began showing the allnew  chevy traverse on its website which includes our full display mirror or as gm calls it the rear camera mirror as one of the primary features identified on the vehicle this will be the th vehicle in the gm lineup to include our full display mirroralso during the first quarter of  we began shipping production of full display mirrors to our second oem as we discussed previously gentex will be the system supplier for our second oem launch which means that gentexs content for this program includes the rearwardfacing camera in addition to the full display mirror the details of this customer should be available on late second quarter once the customer begins their announcements or public marketing of the allnew technologythe gentex full display mirror continues to gain strong interest from our customers for this visionenhancing technology and we remain excited about the future opportunitieson the launch side the company has continued to demonstrate solid growth not only for our inside and outside electrical mirrors but also for advanced technology products that are often housed inside of those mirrors for the first quarter of  the company experienced  net new nameplate launches of inside and outside mirrors this first quarter launch rate is consistent with the launch rate in the first quarter of  which was a record launch year for the company these new launches consisted of approximately  advanced features although this is lower than the mix experienced most of last year it is consistent with the percentage of advanced features in prior yearsgentex continues to see strong launch rates for featured and base products of both inside and outside mirrors which continues to be a leading indicator of our overall interest from our customers and our productsill now hand the call back over to steve for  guidance and closing remarkssteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp thank you neil based on the april  ihs light vehicle production forecast and our current forecasted product mix and expense growth estimates the company is making no changes to its  revenue estimates of  billion to  billion and gross margins between  and  however based on weakening light vehicle production estimates in europe for the second quarter and in north america in the third quarter the company expects its revenue estimates for the second and third quarter of  to be at or around the lower end of this annual guidance range but expects the fourth quarter to return to the higher end of its annual guidance range based on the current production data from ihs our  revenue estimates also remain unchanged from previous guidancewed like to take a few minutes just to thank all of our employees of gentex globally for their hard work and dedication that resulted in our first quarter results especially given the supplier issues we have been working through since the fourth quarter of we appreciate everyones time today and we can now proceed to questions thank youquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of chris van horn from fbrchristopher ralph van horn fbr capital markets  co research division  associate so on the chevy traverse just  could you walk us through kind of how that came about and then what the penetration is going to be for that program is it going to be all platforms or just certain platforms to startsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes so on the penetration side as has been pretty common with the fdm rollout at gm its going to be limited to some trim levels actually on the traverse they havent disclosed what those trim levels are yet and so were still waiting for gm to take the lead there and kind of walk through and show on their website what the packaging will look like for the product on the vehicle in terms of i think the second part of your question was about how that came to be in terms of adding that vehicle and really this is kind of what weve been talking about for a little bit as it relates to gms product strategy when they went down this path with us in developing this technology it was really focused on kind of a broader execution we had mentioned early on that we didnt think it would be limited to just the cadillac lineup obviously the bolt was kind of the first indication of that but then also now adding the traverse we believe is a positive sign of gms dedication to the product and how theyre using it as one of their vehicle enhancementschristopher ralph van horn fbr capital markets  co research division  associate got it great and then on the margin side obviously every first quarter price reductions come through did you  did anything stand out at you in terms of was it  program  customer was it generally just across the board and how did this kind of relate on a relative basissteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes so youre right chris typically the first quarter is the toughest one because we have our january  price downs we dont get full benefit from our supply side cost downs there but nothing outside of the normal other than we had really strong mix in the fourth quarter because of product mix and then some of that shifted back to more base mirrors in the first quarter so you saw a little bit of a headwind from that but it should normalize kind of going forward from that supplier issue we saw in the fourth quarterneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering and we should  that supplier issue did cause some of the mix issues fourth quarter to be higher than normal and then first quarter to be slightly lower than  slightly lower than normalchristopher ralph van horn fbr capital markets  co research division  associate got it and then just last one for me obviously really strong showing at ces this is the first time weve kind of talked to you since then could you update us on the pipeline for some of those new technologies you introduced because i think theres some interesting things therekevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting yes so i think if you look at the  thanks for bringing that up too it was a strong show for us at ces in terms of new product offering the thing were busy right now is we would kind of put this in a time period of probably  to  months before we have anything probably to announce from those just because the products were pretty cutting edge and it does take a while to get the customer interest in there their understanding of those products and then try to find a way to make them fit into their strategic lineup but we have a lot of  weve had a lot of meetings since then with oems going into deeper dive on what the aspects are of the products and then doing customer drive letting them experience those products especially we talked about the camera monitoring system thats something that we worked hard on and put together some development vehicles that have been positioned in various parts of the world so that oems can get behind the wheel and experience what that product is like to drive what i can tell you is that its changed some of our relationships with our customers were getting higher level meetings and were having a lot more interest around those products than what we have had historicallyoperator and our next question comes from the line of rich kwas from wells fargo securitiesrichard michael kwas wells fargo securities llc research division  md and senior equity research analyst i just want to follow up on that last question regarding   months steve is that  to  months before you think youd sign a contract or  to  months before it would go in  any of those technologies would go into productionsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp contracts yes so what were  yes what wed be focused on there is the sales and then the decision by the oem and then obviously going through the quote phaserichard michael kwas wells fargo securities llc research division  md and senior equity research analyst so then from a production commercial standpoint itd probably be another   months after thatsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes thats a fair time line probably more on the  side especially when you start talking about cms i mean thats probably even a hair longer because of the complexity of that product offeringneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering yes the impact of styling a new vehiclesteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp rightrichard michael kwas wells fargo securities llc research division  md and senior equity research analyst right okay and then the launch on fdm with the second oe is that confined to  or  platforms is that more broadbasedsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp the initial launch for this one was a single platform obviously with each of these oems were announcing were expecting additional platforms over the next  to  months as they start to roll out the productrichard michael kwas wells fargo securities llc research division  md and senior equity research analyst okay and then are you done with the decontenting that occurred last year with one of your europeanbased customers is that fully lapped at this pointsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes i would say the bulk of it was last year i mean you have a little bit of the vehicles that are rolling off but   of that in fact was really last yearrichard michael kwas wells fargo securities llc research division  md and senior equity research analyst okay okay and then last one i know i asked this question or someone asks it every quarter but cash building youve indicated a greater willingness to do ma how should we think about it are you more likely to do a larger transaction if you will around actually buying an entity for a few hundred million dollars or youre partnering with some other folks around some of these newer technologies is that maybe more the route you take around trying to diversify the business and sustain the growth ratesteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp well the simple answer is were obviously open to all of those and so were not opposed to the concept of looking at an acquisition that includes an income statement and a product offering existing product offering really over the last  years what weve been focused on is more on the technology side and thats kind of what you saw at the ces booth its more about taking the cutting edge technology helping us incorporate that and develop the come to market strategy with that new tech that  but neither of those preclude the other so i would say were open to both obviously its a very active market on the ma front so weve been investigating a lot of things for better or for worse we have to be able to find a deal that was  we were able to close or at a price point that we felt was acceptableoperator and our next question comes from the line of brett hoselton from keybancbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst first just a follow on the full display mirror product can you talk about what your thoughts are as far as future contract wins in other words as you look out over the next year do you think that youd be able to get another one  customers on that or do you think thats optimistic or do you think you might be able to get more i know youre  im not asking you to name the customers of course but whats your general sense theresteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes if you used  i think you used the  year time line is that correct brettbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst yessteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes if you looked out on the year i think its reasonable to expect we get at least one more during that time periodneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering yes one additionalsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp one additional contract in other words so  with an oem and so we would use that as a reasonable expectation it could be better than that obviously but i think thats a pretty safe and reasonable expectationbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst okay and then switching gears homelink you talked about potential growth in china can you give us a sense as to where is that atsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes so like we mentioned before its just getting legs under it nowneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering rightsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp i believe in the next probably  by the end of calendar year  well probably be shipping about  or  different nameplates fairly low volume applications but nonetheless its the beginning of that marketing process of introducing that product and then walking the customer through the experience and making sure that the use case is met and that we execute flawlessly with the product launchbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst and then finally on the smartbeam side have you  do you continue to get contract wins id say over the past  months or year something along those linessteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes weve continued to have contract wins on the smartbeam product the one thing that we have talked about is that theres wins and losses obviously the losses are predicated primarily on competition with full driver assist systems and typically our wins are coming in different type vehicles either the lower end of vehicles or on lower segment vehicles or in emerging markets and thats kind of been the trend and we expect that trend to kind of continue in other words as full driver assist systems take off and start to become higher volume it does create a bit of a headwind for the business and were looking for new ways to try to offset those losses in those lower segments or in those emerging marketsbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst so netnet the smartbeam revenue is probably going to be flat to down to some amount is that a fair statementsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes id say over the next few years thats probably an accurate trendbrett david hoselton keybanc capital markets inc research division  md and equity research analyst okay and then finally did you quantify the  you obviously had some commodity issues here in the fourth quarter and did you quantify the revenue benefit from the reversal of those as you moved into the first quarterkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting it was about  million  we were about  million short in the fourth quarter from what we had not shipped and then we kind of filled up back with that  million to  million of revenue so not a major impact on the growth in the quarter but that wassteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp but it did  we did pick it back up yeskevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting yesoperator and our next question comes from the line of david leiker from bairdadam christopher schmitz robert w baird  co incorporated research division  research analyst this is adam on the line for david starting with the strength in international shipments certainly europe vehicle production was a positive in the quarter but you and your growth above market was stronger than it has been in recent quarters any launches or regions you can point to driving the upsidesteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp no i mean if you look at it especially in that european market weve like you mentioned we had pretty good years over the last  years i mean really if youd take out last year and you look beyond that our growth rates there were pretty strong last year weve kind of settled back a little but then this year is kind of picking back up again if you look at it its really across the board a lot of thats driven by some of our frameless technology theres been a lot of inside mirrors obviously weve done fairly well on outside mirrors in that marketplace too over the last  years so id say its pretty well distributed across the board and across all oemsadam christopher schmitz robert w baird  co incorporated research division  research analyst great and then turning to the camera monitoring system that you debuted at ces now that youve had some time to talk to customers what has been the feedback on this product and then for those customers what vehicle segments are they looking to launch this product insteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes so id say first what their reaction is and then well kind of get into what their  how oems make decisions so when you look at their reaction i think especially when they drive it so when we get vehicles in their local area where they can drive and experience the car their immediate reaction is kind of how what we expected it to be and why we came up with this product offering and that is they knew the limitations of camera and displayonly technologies and thats what really had slowed down that evolution is that it doesnt meet all the use cases so when we show this car its kind of taken the best of both worlds combining them into a single product and they see the practical application and why that may be a logical step now as it relates to how that influences their decisionmaking thats a long process i mean you talk about oems very large organizations and a very critical part of the vehicle and safety of that vehicle are mirrors and displays so it takes time and thats the big thing that we found is we have to distribute this product very widely inside of an oem in order to get a positive decision or to get a sourcing commitment so we think thats still going to take quite a while like we talked about in that kind of year to  year decisionmaking window before well see any positive trends from that product offeringoperator and our next question comes from the line of jason rodgers from great lakes reviewjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp i wonder if you could expand a little bit more about your  the comments made on smartbeam as far as revenues expect to be  i think you said flat to slightly down was the comment over the next few years why thats the case and that  to  revenue forecast for this year and next year i guess that would assume no growth from smartbeamsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes exactly so when we give the annual guidance for  and  those are net of those type of trends inside of any one of the products so thats not  that doesnt take away from that growth rate projection and really whats driving that is just the acceptance and the wider penetration of full driver assist systems in the vehicle space so in other words when theres already a camera on the car thats doing the lane departure warning or forward crash obviously they dont necessarily need to have a second camera to do lighting control and so from an economic standpoint the oems are looking for the cheapest way to accomplish that feature set and often times its going to be more advantageous for them to add that type of content and software to an existing hardware module and so thats whats causing most of the headwind now what weve been successful at over the last few years and this has been the case for really the last   years since driver assist has started to roll out in higher volumes what weve always been able to do is find lower segments like in other words an a b or c segment play or the lower term levels on an existing vehicle in other words the entrylevel vehicle may have a lighting only and an upgrade to driver assist higher trim levels and then the third area weve been able to find success is in emerging markets so lower cost car markets where full driver assist system hasnt taken off or isnt as widely accepted and so thats whats caused kind of that flattish to slightly down play on the smartbeam product but weve been able to more than offset that with growth rates in our other product offeringsjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp so longterm high single digit or so growth for the company can be achieved through homelink in the full display mirror you dont necessarily need smartbeam to grow is that a fair statementsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes exactly i mean were not  one of the nice things and one of things youve seen the company kind of really work hard at over the last few years is expand that product offering so were not as dependent on any one product in order to get to above market growth ratesjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp all right and just looking at the updated guidance based on the forecast for automotive production would it be fair to say the second quarter will be more difficult than the third just given the drop in europe thats anticipated and is it possible that your revenue could drop below the  for the second quarter or do you still think it will fall in that rangekevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting well id say first i dont think therell be much of a difference in second and third in terms of the headwind from production because if you look at  europes basically going to be down about  yearoveryear in the second and north america is going to be down about  in the third yearoveryear so we look at those and when we kind of extrapolate our take rates on those production volumes we look at it and say its about an equal amount of headwind for us in between those  quarters its theoretically possible always that you can drop below your guidance i mean depending on what actually happens versus whats forecasted to happen but right now when we look at the guidance for second and third quarters i mean were still inside of our annual guidance range and we feel comfortable with that we dont see or feel anything happening in the marketplace that would drive it to be below that and so we feel pretty comfortable with how were positioned but obviously wed never say that its not possible to drop outside of our guidance rangejason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp and just  quick number questions what percent of your current mirror shipments are frameless and what was the total debt balance at quarter endkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting so the frameless volumes wed have to get back with you on it i dont want to just speculate exactly what that percentage of frameless was versus all inside mirrors so if you would like we could talk about that a little later but i would say its probably in that  to  range i would guess of total inside mirror shipments but thats shooting from the hip wed want to check the data to get you a firm answer there yes and the debt balance is  million as of quarter endoperator and our next question comes from the line of ryan brinkman from jpmorgansamik chatterjee jp morgan chase  co research division  analyst this is samik on behalf of ryan brinkman firstly i wanted to go back to the comment about gross margins and i know within the first quarter theres always the annual purchase price reduction effect we see the impact of but when we look at the yearoveryear i wanted to clarify if there was an impact from raw material inflation on a yearoveryear basis because weve seen commodities run up over the last few months and also if you can remind us whats your biggest spend in terms of raw material and how youre probably  how do you tackle changes in prices in terms of how you hedge with your suppliers or do you have the ability to pass them on to your  to the oem customerssteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp sure so if you start first if you look at the change yearoveryear basically what the net decrease was caused by was our customer  our reductions to our customers and us not being able to fully offset those with our supplier cost reductions so yes youre absolutely right thats the single biggest impact to the quarter and what thats  and thats caused by  just as you mentioned it is a tougher commodities market now we still feel comfortable that in q especially its hard for us because with our inventory levels youre still shipping most of the product that you ship in q as still at prioryear purchases so you have last years economics on the cost side and this years economics on the pricing side now we believe that will improve throughout the year as we roll through that inventory and get into  cost basis of our materials but the important part there is that yes it did fall behind this ppv or our purchase reductions did was behind our pricing reductions to our customer and that whats caused most of the margin pressure now as it relates to the tightening in the supply side it is a tougher market in certain commodities most of our purchases in electronics which has shown a pretty good trend overall over the last several years and weve continued to believe theres opportunities on the electronics side when you start talking plastics and metals and some of the others those are primarily the commodities that are struggling and have a little more pressure on them and so we have to work through design elements engineering tasks and obviously contracts with our customers  with our suppliers to try to find ways to gain the efficiencies that we needsamik chatterjee jp morgan chase  co research division  analyst got it and just a quick follow up on that is there ability to pass on these changes in the commodity prices or raw materials easier on platforms where you are a standard versus where you are optionsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp no id say its very difficult for us and this product and how we are  how we position ourselves and our products to gain relief from the oems on cost pressures associated with the supply side like we mentioned before this isnt really about  this isnt abnormal for us in other words that you see little bit of pressure in q on the margin as it relates to commodities pricing its just something that we tend to work through throughout the year and get better at as the year progressessamik chatterjee jp morgan chase  co research division  analyst got it thats helpful and just a final question today youve sort of spent some time highlighting the weaker production environment that youre seeing in europe and also in north america and it seems like thats somewhat softer environment that youre seeing from the  here at the start of the year so just curious how do you think about sort of adoption or even customer appetite for your advanced feature products and the higher asp products given entertainment environment where productions are weaker how do you think about your option of those trackingkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting sure well theres  elements and we like to  and thats a good question because we like to spend a little time talking about theres  distinct elements as it relates to auto production one of them is the number of cars produced and if you look across the segmentation theres a lot of different economics associated with purchase decisions by consumers anywhere from  cars to  cars and so its not just about how many cars are produced its about what is the average content or price of those cars when theyre consumed and what you tend to see is that in this environment for instance were not seeing as much pressure on the technology side or on the pricing of the vehicles as much as about the total volume and so one of the things were focused on our oems are still interested in technology because they are differentiators for them and it is what the consumer is interested in is seeing that technology advancement and deployment in the vehicle environment so we continue to work really hard to show them alternatives and unique products that we hope will help separate their vehicles and create a technology package that the consumer valuesoperator and our next question comes from the line of matt stover from sigmatthew t stover susquehanna financial group lllp research division  analyst two things one just to clarify if you could just comment on your expectations for production is that a reflection of the ihs numbers youre seeing or are you making additional subjective decisions or judgments about production schedules in particular regions and particular period of timessteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp no i mean basically when we  yes when we talk about that that is a pure ihs number so when we look at the downside in europe and downside in north america that was the end of march based on ihs forecastmatthew t stover susquehanna financial group lllp research division  analyst yes yes okay and the second question is is if we look at the full display mirrors how should we think about the margin impact of those products over the course of the next couple of years as their volume builds is that more favorable relative to the average at the average or belowsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp in terms of revenue or gross marginmatthew t stover susquehanna financial group lllp research division  analyst im thinking gross marginsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp so well okay so weve talked about the revenue aspects so the higher asp obviously associated with those products and we believe those  the trend will be towards the corporate averagematthew t stover susquehanna financial group lllp research division  analyst towards the corporate average okayoperator our next question comes from the line of david whiston from morningstardavid whiston morningstar inc research division  strategist i wanted to first start with biometrics just thinking long term here i mean what areas of that could you do more beyond iris scans i mean could you something like a fingerprint in the mirror or voice recognition things like thatsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes i mean if you look at the possibilities theres a lot of things that we have a skill set in that we could bring to the market historically weve shied away from anything that touches kind of the glass surface and the reason why is its cosmetically not a great solution when it comes to fingerprints and leaving fingerprints on a reflective surface it tends to look bad its not to say that you cant do it i mean technologically its feasible the issue is trying to find what do our customers want so what were really focused on is how do we offer that kind of that security solution in a biometrics form with a very high level of security that fits the customers use case and what they want their customer experience to be and so whats interesting about this with the iris offering is its kind of taken us into different discussions with our customers that we havent had historically to try to understand just that what is their desire what are they looking for for their customer experience and is there a way for gentex to play a part of thatdavid whiston morningstar inc research division  strategist okay and international unit volume is growing much better than domestic or north america and just particular for this quarter on the variance i mean where is most of this international growth coming fromkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting yes you typically are going to see that david because of our higher penetration in north america and so we did see like steve talked about earlier europe was pretty strong in the quarter but japan and korea actually performed very well for us so the korean customers have been kind of in a lull lately but this quarter was a strong performance and then japan we saw good growth there so it was really again a function of i think weve been talking about for a long time japan and korea have been depressed but they saw a little bit of a turnaround in the quarterdavid whiston morningstar inc research division  strategist okay and my last question is on your comments earlier on the production forecast and i believe  and q is going to pick back up versus q q softness i mean what gives you confidence of that forecast by ihs will prove correct is it just the expectation on new model roll overs product cadencesteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp well really when you look at it youre looking at yearoveryear comps and so the headwind from europe and north america in q and q have a portion to do with this year in the production level but also the prior years production level and how does that look and so when we look at that forecast we feel fairly comfortable we feel fairly comfortable with what those are going to be and typically you have the seasonality of the calendar year as it relates to oems and their production levels when we look at q we dont see any of those numbers that look too far out of the norm versus what the oems are planning on now as it relates to q we just have better color i mean youre typically dealing in  to  week release windows from your customers and so where you start to get actual orders versus just ihs data and thats whats gives us the confidence around q and starting to move into q q is really just a pure forecast at that point but the point is like what we study as a regression analysis around ihs and how they do from a forecast standpoint   and  months out and we dont see anything that would  that to us appears like its challenged beyond the numbers theyre forecastingoperator our next question comes from the line of john murphy from bank of americajohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst maybe if i could just kind of follow up on that question is there anything outside of the production schedule specifically around your business on product launches thats creating some sort of pressure in the second and third quarter that might bounce back in the fourth quarter so you wouldnt be as reliant on these schedules bouncing backsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp no if you look at  i mean if you look at our launch cadence and whats happening with the business we dont see anything on our side that would be changing in q or q that will then come back in q you have normal roll off of old programs and a restart of some of them you have the normal cadence inside of the automotive cycle obviously ihs tends to be a hair bearish in q especially on shutdowns and so part of that may be driving the cut in production especially in the north american market in q but aside from that we dont see anything on our side that would be changing that growth rate story inside the yearjohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst got it okay then just a second question and i apologize i dont think ive heard anything on homelink and sort of an update on take rates and the future of that business i think youve talked about smartbeam but is there any update on homelink and take rates and how that business is goingsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes i mean if you look at it since  ill kind of just back up really since the acquisition weve posted pretty solid numbers on the growth story as it relates to homelink so typically at about  really over the kind of   year period its been running right around there  slightly above at times we continue to believe that that kind of  to  growth rate that weve talked about corporately is right in line with what we expect homelink and what weve seen out of the homelink product in terms of penetrationjohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst okay and then just lastly the  million that went from longterm debt to shortterm debt i mean as i look at that as far as i can tell a lot of maturities or all the maturities you have are september of  so thats outside of  months im just curious why that got reclassified into shortterm debtkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting yes its just more of being outward about our intent and whats going to become based on our payment schedules what we plan to pay down over the next  and then obviously like you said once it becomes current the rest of it will fold over into current at that time so september you should expect the full balance to become current after the third quarterneil boehm gentex corporation  vp of engineering so its a clear signal that a big  million chunk of it is going to get paid almost  months early right its the simple way to put itkevin c nash gentex corporation  cao and vp of accounting i mean if you look weve been averaging between  million and kind of  million a quarter depending on cash flow from operations and how its looking in preparation honestly for that october  maturity of the debtjohn joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst so i guess theres no rash  i mean theres no thought process of potentially trying to roll this debt in the market it seems like you guys are just heading towards the paydown pathsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes exactly and the reason why primarily its a variable rate  its variable rate debt today obviously theres speculation on what those rates are going to look like we feel like were in a better position to go ahead and pay that down and then if an acquisition presents itself obviously we can always kind of reschedule or reup a new borrowing tool to cover that new target but based off of the operations of the business our cash generation model and where were headed its definitely a sign that were intending to pay that all off by the fall of john joseph murphy bofa merrill lynch research division  md and lead united states auto analyst and im sorry to put a finer point on it it means that you guys will let those facilities expire wont reup them unless you see some other kind of opportunity emerge over the next  months or in the couple of years whatever maybesteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes i mean  yes that one is just a function of the cost of those instruments and if theyre very effective and inexpensive to have them available we will obviously were not going to carry cost that we dont need if we dont see a target on the horizon that looks like we need availability of cashoperator our next question comes from the line of jason rodgers from great lakes reviewjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp do you have the growth rate of smartbeam revenuewise in steven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp im sorry could you say that againjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp the smartbeam the revenue growth rate for smartbeam in steven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp in  it was  i think it was midsingle digitsjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp okay so just to be clear then youre expecting that to be flattish or so going forwardsteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes flat to down yesjason andrew rodgers great lakes review  vp okay and as far as homelink what is the churn penetration rate of homelink in the ussteven r downing gentex corporation  cfo and svp yes youre right around  right nowoperator im showing no further questions and i would like to
