categories political science  political processelections political science  political processpolitical parties campaign finance and political polarization when purists prevail raymond j la raja and brian f schaffner an illuminating perspective on the polarizing effects of campaign finance reform this open access edition was funded by the william and flora hewlett foundation through its madison initiative description efforts to reform the us campaign finance system typically focus on the corrupting influence of large contributions yet as raymond j la raja and brian f schaffner argue reforms aimed at cutting the flow of money into politics have unintentionally favored candidates with extreme ideological agendas and consequently fostered political polarization drawing on data from  states and the us congress over  years la raja and schaffner reveal that current rules allow wealthy ideological groups and donors to dominate the financing of political campaigns in order to attract funding candidates take uncompromising positions on key issues and if elected take their partisan views into the legislature as a remedy the authors propose that additional campaign money be channeled through party organizations—rather than directly to candidates—because these organizations tend to be less ideological than the activists who now provide the lion’s share of money to political candidates shifting campaign finance to parties would ease polarization by reducing the influence of “purist” donors with their rigid policy stances la raja and schaffner conclude the book with policy recommendations for campaign finance in the united states they are among the few nonlibertarians who argue that less regulation particularly for political parties may in fact improve the democratic process “ray la raja and brian schaffner have written an important book from a fresh research perspective that needs to be incorporated into all discussions of money in politics from polarization to the proper role of the political parties this book takes an extremely productive look at what is happening in the states and how that might serve as a laboratory for what works and what doesn’t in our elections” —benjamin l ginsberg partner jones day former counsel to rnc the mitt romney campaign and the bushcheney campaigns “as american politics has grown more polarized more shrill and more deadlocked reformers have been treating it with horsedoctors’ doses of the wrong medicine—or so ray la raja and brian schaffner argue in this deeply researched closely argued and urgently important book instead strengthening the role of parties and political professionals could begin restoring health to the body politic this counterintuitive and compelling book will change the way you think” —jonathan rauch senior fellow the brookings institution “laraja and schaffners book upends conventional wisdom on money in politics they demonstrate convincingly that our disfigured campaign funding system has led to the worst of all worlds unlimited and unaccountable outside spending that polarizes our politics alongside hamstrung political parties that would be in the best position to reign in extremists and create governing coalitions the book is a mustread for anyone who cares about the mockery our campaign financing system has become”—nathaniel persily james b mcclatchy professor of law stanford law school “it might seem paradoxical that strengthening parties could actually reduce partisan polarization but that is exactly the provocative argument that la raja and schaffner make it is an argument worth taking seriously by anyone who wants to make american politics less divisive”—john sides george washington university “i believe this book will be one of the more important contributions in the last decade to understanding the dynamics of political polarization in america today campaign finance and political polarization is methodologically innovative and impressive in the data bases it uses to take advantage of the ‘natural’ comparative social science ‘experiment’ in the effects of campaign finance regulation on the legislative process that results from different regimes across the states” —rick pildes new york university cover image  nlshopveer raymond j la raja is associate professor of political science at the university of massachusetts–amherst and associate director of the umass poll  brian f schaffner is professor of political science at the university of massachusetts–amherst director of the umass poll and a coprincipal investigator for the cooperative congressional election study praise  awards la raja and schaffner meticulously analyse party factions who donates to political campaigns and why and they also examine data that indicate how fewer restrictions on political parties increase financial support for moderate candidates anyone interested in looking at an alternative to the current campaign finance system should read this

description reformers lament that with every effort to regulate the sources of campaign funding candidates creatively circumvent the new legislation but in fact political fundraisers dont need to look for loopholes because as raymond j la raja proves legislators intentionally design regulations to gain advantage over their partisan rivals la raja traces the history of the us campaign finance system from the late nineteenth century through the passage of the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra of  then using the  presidential election as a case study he compares the ways in which democrats and republicans adapted their national fundraising and campaigning strategies to satisfy bcra regulations drawing upon this wealth of historical and recent evidence he concludes with recommendations for reforming campaign finance in ways that promote fair competition among candidates and guarantee their accountability to voters small change offers an engaging account of campaign finance reforms contradictory history it is a mustread for anyone concerned about influence of money on democratic elections raymond j la raja is assistant professor of political science at the university of

finance regulation is understood in place of the debate we have had for years now stale and unproductive he asks for a realistic appraisal of the interests served by regulation and its costs—including an original view of the competing interests of different factions even within parties his account is particularly compelling in showing the adverse effects of the current regulatory scheme on political parties overall and he takes the responsible course of matching his analysis to fresh policy recommendations his book will be read widely and it will make a difference —robert bauer chair of the political law group of perkins coie llp sen barack obamas groundbreaking decision to reject public financing was widely criticized by good government groups and reformminded lawmakers in both parties however small change money political parties and campaign finance reform predicted this would be a direct result of the mccainfeingold campaign finance reform law—the same law supported by most of those now blasting obamas decisionultimately la raja favors a series of reforms that strengthen the political parties including higher contribution limits to the national parties and allowing greater party coordinated spending these proposals acknowledge that past reforms efforts to limit campaign money were doomed to fail and that no one should be surprised of the campaign finance system

really set off a room such as a living room or bedroom in addition to looking good curtains and window treatments need to be functional as well which is what may cause someone to favor one over the other curtains and drapes are a way to add color style and depth to a room and can serve to showcase the windows of your home theyre available in many colors as well as materials including linen cotton rayon satin polyester silk and several different fabric blends you can choose curtains and drapes that run from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of higher ceilings or those that are just slightly larger than the window theyre covering for a crisper look or if you have small children or pets at home that you dont want to play with longer curtains when selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiencyanother common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows and you can adjust them depending on the time of day many shades are made from wood wood composite or synthetic wood but there are shades made from vinyl metal and bamboo as well depending on the blinds they generally rest inside the window frame so youll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out especially on hot days these also go inside the window frame choose cordless shades that pull down and raise with a quick tug when you dont want dangling cordslighting and light fixtureslighting options include permanent fixtures such as overhead lighting wall fixtures and ceiling fan lights lamps are portable lights you can place anywhere and can range from table lamps to floor lamps permanent ceiling fixtures that you choose depend on the style youre seeking to match for an old world or traditional feel you can select chandeliers or pendant lighting for more modern touches dome or flush mount lighting and track lighting are good options chandeliers look especially good above a dining table or in an entryway or hall many permanent fixtures allow you to control the amount of light put out through the use of a dimmer switch you can add ceiling fans with lights serve a dual purpose and allow you to run one without the other or both at the same time ceiling fans also help the heating and cooling units in your home be more efficient giving you added cost savings on your energy billslamps are often more decorative

barcoding unveils skate chondrichthyes rajidae species diversity in ‘ray’ products sold across ireland and the uk peerj e httpsdoiorgpeerj the authors have chosen to make the review history of this article public abstract skates are widely consumed across the globe but many large species are subject to considerable concern regarding their conservation and management within europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that for the first time reports of skate landings now have to be made under speciesspecific names total allowable catches have also been established for many groups which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species eg dipturus batis raja undulata and rostoraja alba whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray” the matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature and the fact that they are commercially valued for their wings thus before sale their bodies are usually discarded ie “winged” and often skinned making morphological identification impossible for the first time dna barcoding of the mitochondrial coi gene was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the british isles providing insight into which species are sold for consumption a total of  wing samples were analysed revealing that six species were sold blonde ray raja brachyura spotted ray raja montagui thornback ray raja clavata cuckoo ray leucoraja naevus smalleyed ray raja microocellata and shagreen ray leucoraja fullonica statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates the results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers in addition the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern interestingly a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smallergrowing species generally to be considered of lower conservation concern of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines introduction skates batoid elasmobranchs of the family rajidae but colloquially referred to as rays are consumed across the world with recent estimates of global total catch reaching approximately  tonnes per annum seafish  whilst skates are rarely specifically targeted by fisheries they form a significant bycatch and constitute an important commercial group for human consumption the group also contains many species that are potentially vulnerable to even low levels of harvesting due to their large size slow growth late maturity and low fecundity dulvy  reynolds  this has famously been demonstrated in the common skate species complex dipturus batis which was the first fish to become locally extinct in parts of its former range through a clear link to commercial fishing brander  of the  rajids assessed by the international union for the conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species excluding those defined as data deficient  are listed as threatened iucn  in response to skate declines the european union eu has now established total allowable catches tac for skates in most european waters and currently it is ‘prohibited for eu vessels to fish for to retain on board or to land’ three species raja undulata raja alba and the d batiscomplex cec  until recently landings of different skate species were combined under a single category such that serious declines in one species could effectively be masked by stable trends in more abundant groups dulvy et al  therefore to more easily assess trends in abundance of individual species a recent eu regulation cec  has been introduced to ensure that landings of many skates are recorded by species and not as an aggregated group identification remains problematic as skates are a morphologically conservative group making the process of distinguishing between some species difficult furthermore similarly to shark finning skates are only commercially valued for their large pectoral fins or ‘wings’ so prior to sale their bodies are usually discarded ie “winged” and often skinned making morphological identification impossible molecular genetic techniques for species identification therefore represent the only methods for distinguishing between different skates allowing for the protection of threatened species or populations and also the recognition of groups with different commercial values indeed previous studies utilising molecular approaches for species identification of skate species have proved highly effective often helping to uncover previously cryptic diversity díaz de astarloa et al  smith et al  griffiths et al  in recent years international efforts have been made to establish a standardised reference dna barcode of life database bold wwwbarcodinglifeorg ratnasingham  hebert  with the aim of generating cytochromec oxidase i or coi gene sequences to facilitate the identification of all animals this includes a campaign to dna barcode all fishes fishbol ward hanner  hebert  in fact specific efforts have already been made to collect validated barcode sequences for skates both within europe serrapereira et al  and globally ward et al  coulson et al  lago vietites  espineira  these reference sequences have now facilitated numerous molecular studies of species identification and mislabelling which have helped identify high levels of substitution in many commercial products marko et al  wong  hanner  cawthorn steinman  witthuhn  particular insights have also been gained through applications of dna barcoding to elasmobranch products which have demonstrated high levels of fraudulent substitutions in sales of sharks barbuto et al  identified endangered species in confiscated shark fins holmes steinke  ward  and revealed the sale of endangered sawfish as “shark” fillets in markets in brazil melo palmeira et al  despite eu legislation regarding the correspondence of specieslatin names for landings skates are still generally sold under the broad title of ray or skate wings with skate wings typically originating from the larger fish therefore little remains known about exactly which species are passed on to consumers beside the increasing number of studies reporting substantial levels of seafood mislabelling logan et al  miller  mariani  the importance of guaranteeing informed consumer choice has also been highlighted miller jessel  mariani  which is particularly relevant to the sales of skate moreover in recent years several large supermarket chains have consciously moved from stocking ‘skate’ to ‘ray’ wings presumably reflecting a desire to sell smaller species from more sustainable sources waitrose  this study represents the first intensive investigation into the patterns of the sale of skate species in the northeast atlantic specifically the republic of ireland roi and the united kingdom uk with a particular focus on a whether those species that are prohibited to land within the eu appear on sale and b if market variations can be detected between different retail sectors andor regions materials  methods sample collection samples labelled as ray or skate wings were initially purchased from fishmongers or fish counters within supermarkets and takeaway ‘fish and chips’ shops from across dublin roi the retailers were also visited in two distinct periods january–february and october–november  a total of  wings from  fish mongerscounters and  takeaways were analysed table  and supplemental information in order to provide a wider view of patterns of skate consumption  additional fresh ray or skate wings were also collected between october  and march  from around the uk sampling was focused in the southwest of england ie counties of devon and cornwall northwest england largely in greater manchester and liverpool glasgow scotland and cardiff wales uk samples were limited to ‘fresh’ products as investigations of takeaways in the uk cities failed to identify any that sold skate repeat sampling from any single shop was kept to a minimum although it was necessary in some cases to increase the sample size but efforts were generally made to sample on different dates or from different sized wings supplemental information  therefore between january  and march  a total of  wings were collected

following miller jessel  mariani  and dna extractions were completed according to a modified chloroform extraction procedure petit excoffier  mayer  dna barcoding specifically of coi gene was selected as the species identification tool hebert et al  approximately  base pairs bp of the coi region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using primers designed by ward et al  fishf ′tcgactaatcataaagatatcggcac′ and fishr ′acttcagggtgaccgaagaatcagaa′ reaction conditions following serrapereira et al  were utilized for all purchased skate samples the pcr products were sequenced by macrogen inc seoul and source bioscience nottingham and the results were checked by eye in bioedit version  hall  for errors and ambiguous base calls the sequences were then input into the bold system using the species level barcode database to identify the species of each sample and then crossreferenced using blast on genbank basic local alignment search tool national centre for biotechnology information bethesda maryland wwwncbinlmnihgov a  similarity criterion was used as a threshold above which identification of unknown samples was deemed reliable as analysis of barcode records suggests at a divergence of greater than  it is very likely that sequences belong to different species ward  any additional matches within this  criterion are also reported in the supplemental information however in the case of the bold system only additional matches within the public record barcode database are described this should help ensure that the primary identification is made with a comprehensive database that maximises the chance of finding a strong match but any additional matches are only made with the more closely regulated dataset helping to reduce issues associated with the misidentification of submitted records data analysis principal component analysis pca of the data was conducted in primer clarke  warwick  with each retailer representing an individual data point in the ordination the software was also used to conduct a nonparametric analysis of similarity anosim with  permutations and to calculate the contribution of variables to similarity or similarity percentages simper both utilised the braycurtis similarity measure during calculation otherwise the program defaults were utilised results  discussion dna barcoding good quality sequences were obtained for all  skate samples these varied in length between  and  bp average length  bp searches on bold and genbank generally produced clear matches allowing for confident assignment of species and there was good agreement between databases in fact all the searches yielded matches that were within  similarity to database records with one exception supplemental information  in this case a  match on bold was made but no results within the  similarity criterion were located in genbank so the bold identification was utilised additionally in  cases a second close match also with less than  divergence to the unknown samples was also identified these additional matches originated from closely related sister taxa but in every case the species were not distributed around the british isles they included raja maderensis that is restricted to madeira and the azores raja polystigma that is restricted to the mediterranean raja straeleni and leucoraja walacei that both have a primarily south african distribution therefore the additional matches were deemed unlikely to be the true source of the samples and the species with the highest degree of similarity from the bold species level

conservation issues across the study no species with a vulnerable status on the redlist iucn  or an eu zero tac was identified given the severe declines in abundance of these skate species this may simply reflect the relatively modest sample collection assembled here but considerable efforts across the british isles have been made to emphasise the conservation status and tac limits placed on many skates eg seafish  therefore the complete absence of species of critical conservation concern may also reflect effective controls by the eu and efforts of fishermen and stakeholders to reduce landings of these groups perhaps a more stringent test of such action could be made in regions where threatened species are more locally abundant eg r undulata remains relatively common around the channel isles ellis mccully  brown  and analyses focused on this area could form a more rigorous test of effective landing controls interestingly the largest growing species identified r brachyura also occurred most frequently in the study maybe more awareness should focus on r brachyura as size has been suggested as a good proxy for vulnerability to overexploitation dulvy  reynolds  r brachyura r clavata and l fullonica that were identified in the purchased wings are already included under the ‘nearthreatened’ category in the iucn redlist r brachyura is also listed under the red category in the marine conservation society’s good fish guide mcs  which suggests it should not be so extensively consumed perhaps guidelines on the maximum size of skate wings sold would increase consumer confidence that the products originate from sustainable sources and reinforce action to protect some of the vulnerable large growing species this would certainly simplify consumer choice but could potentially overlook trading or harvesting of juveniles from the large growing species that could go undetected due to their small size variation in patterns of sale this study represents a relatively intensive effort to collect samples from ray wings across multiple timepoints regions and countries and goes beyond many previous investigations of seafood and mislabelling that focused on a single city port or landing notwithstanding these efforts it has resulted in a relatively modest sample collection in part this reflects the fact that ray wings were not commonly available in some areas particularly within the uk where many retailers were visited that did not stock them but it also reflects a desire to avoid high levels of repeat sampling from any one location or supermarket chain it is hoped this approach gives the samples analysed a high degree of independence not just repeatedly sampling from the same supply chains producing a truly comprehensive examination of the sale of skates therefore despite the modest sample size this study represents the first occasion that an investigation of the patterns of sale of ray wings can be made between retailer types seasons and regions a highly significant difference was identified in species sold between fishmongers and takeaways within dublin the additional level of processing in takeaways provides greater opportunity for large wings originating from larger species to be divided before sale conversely wings from smaller growing species may form more attractive sizes for sale in fishmongers in recent years a number of supermarkets have also made a move towards selling wings from smaller skate species waitrose  marketing them as sustainably sourced ‘ray’ wings as  of the ray wings sampled across the entire study in the fishmonger group originated from supermarket fish counters this may help explain the difference in species sold it is also interesting to note that whilst all the samples analysed were labelled as “ray” or “skate” and all the species identified belonged to the rajidae family complying with broad expectations of the labels one supermarket chain went further and specified its wings originated from three smaller growing species in the six cases where wings were analysed from this chain two belonged to r clavata that was not included on the label therefore demonstrating a  level of mislabelling within this small subset of samples overall the sale of skates under ambiguous names remains a challenge to the consumers’ ability to exercise a right to choose those from less vulnerable groups a somewhat surprising result from the data analysis was the failure to identify any significant difference in the patterns of species sold in the januaryfebruary and octobernovember sample collections from dublin many elasmobranch species are highly migratory particularly with reference to specific nursery areas with marked seasonal movements between the north sea and thames estuary for r clavata having already been observed hunter et al  therefore it may be expected that such seasonal movements would affect capture vulnerability in commercial fisheries and hence patterns of availability to consumers one explanation for this result is that retailers will freeze stocks of fish to ensure a steady supply in the case of skates previous work suggests this is not common even within takeaway shops as the wings do not freeze well so supply was dependent on local fisheries miller  mariani  however much remains unknown about the exact provenance of samples sold behaviour of fisherman and even the movements of skate species ellis et al  such that interpreting patterns of sale of skates remains difficult the same problems for interpretation occur when comparing sales of skate species in the different countries roi and uk which were also nonsignificant perhaps this reflects the fact that the sale of ray wings in both countries exploits similar species and stocks of skates although in this case the comparison is also confounded by the fact that sample collection was conducted approximately two years apart the only other study to utilise genetic methods of species identification on skate products was recently conducted by lago vietites  espineira  in spain the  samples of whole or winged fresh skate analysed there originated not only from species found around spain but included groups restricted to other areas of europe and even south america this suggests patterns of sale could vary dramatically between countries or regions and they will not simply reflect levels of abundance in local fisheries conclusions this study represents the first intensive effort to investigate patterns in the sale of skate wings the results show that no species with a vulnerable status on the redlist iucn  or with prohibited landings in the eu appear to contribute to the market given the low abundance of many of these species further investigations may be required to accurately assess whether these groups may reach points of sale anywhere in europe investigations at the point of landing and throughout the supply chain would also provide interesting insights into accuracy of identification and reveal if any species are landed but withdrawn before reaching retailers the results also demonstrate significant differences between the retailers fishmonger and takeaway included in the study understanding why fishmongers also tended to sell smallergrowing species is challenging but may relate to a desire to supply less vulnerable groups this study also highlights that the use of ambiguous and amalgamated sales terms makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to choose species of lesser conservation concern interestingly analysis of six wings from the only retailer to label its ray wings as originating from three smaller growing species showed two  actually originated from r clavata a larger species with a decreasing population trend that is listed as near threatened on the iucn redlist iucn  supplemental information details of the samples collected location and date of purchase length of dna barcode amplified
