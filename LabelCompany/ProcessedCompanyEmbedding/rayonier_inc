speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks

wood products     real estate at rayonier we evaluate each acre of our timberland to determine its greatest potential and highest and best use in some cases land that was once best suited for growing

forest products rating hold price target   chip dillon  cdverticalresearchpartnerscom james armstrong rayonier  breaking up is hard to do after  years rayonier about to split in two  on or about june th rayonier will spin off its specialty dissolving pulp operations into a new company called rayonier advanced materials several years after rayonier was spun out of the old itt international telephone and telegraph in  the company actively explored spinning off its specialty pulp business but decided in the midst of the lates tech bubble that the market would not be attentive to a small timber company and a small pulp producer in fact in  one timber ipo we worked on at salomon smith barney strategic timber trust failed miserably this decision to hold off proved fortuitous as ryn was able to support a high and rising dividend over the intervening years as the specialty dissolving pulp business and through the reit conversion the favorable tax laws carried the company with log markets likely near a bottom and development real estate in northern fl and southeastern ga soon to take off the split should work there will be challenges if log prices and demand do not continue to recover the remainco rayonier may have to depend on land sales a la plum creek in recent years to fund its planned  dividend yield management hopes the specialty dissolving pulp business will be viewed as a specialty chemical play  which we see as unlikely in coming quarters given overcapacity and weak pricing raising our target  to  on timberland recovery  in january soon after the upcoming spinoff of the performance fibers specialty dissolving pulp business was announced we increased our oneyear target on ryn by  to  our view then was to value the pf business at around share based on a  discount to the dow jones specialty chemicals index and the assumption of  billion of debt with the remainco timberland and real estate what will be rayonier valued at  at this time we are tempering our view of the performance fibers to be called rayonier advanced materials valuation by  to  while upping our view of the remainco by  to  based on the improved outlook for its development lands and improvements in its key timber markets with ryn closing on friday at exactly our  target we maintain our hold rating the  closet dividend cut  lets be clear one result of the rayonier advanced materials ram spinoff will be the nearly  dividend cut rayonier had increased its payout steadily in recent years to the current share rate after the spinoff of rayonier advanced materials we see the combined dividend rate at around  an effective reduction of nearly  basically management has indicated that it sees a dividend yield of  on the ram business  which on a  stock would be around  per quarter or  annually it also sees a competitive yield on the remaining timber reit company when looking at the other  major publiclytraded timber reits and rounding up we see about a  yield if our  postspin valuation of ryn is correct the dividend should be around  per quarter or  annually raising eps estimates a nickel  we are increasing our eps estimates for rayonier by  cents for   and  as a result of our move our  estimate moves to  our  number goes to  and our  estimate rises to  of course in the next several weeks we will be publishing separate estimates for both the postspin ryn as well as the new ram our best guess is that whenissued trading may begin in midjune our higher estimates mainly reflect expected higher timberland income first quarter hints of timberland recovery rayonier reported operating eps of  in the first quarter of  missing significantly both our  estimate and the  consensus however the company actually operated well with the shortfall owing to an unusuallylow level of land sales that will reverse in coming quarters the table below shows how ryn performed in the first quarter relative to our expectations on a linebyline basis figure  rayonier first quarter  estimated vs actual eps source company reports and vertical research partners stock view with rayonier recently trading near our  oneyear target price we recommend investors hold rayonier shares especially given its attractive prospective combined  dividend yield based on a  dividend at ram and  at ryn as described above the companys risk profile has increased given the substantial increase in ryns specialty dissolving pulp performance fibers capacity and given the guide down in pricing expectations in this business specifically ryn sees more competitive conditions in its highend specialty dissolving pulp markets which will cause average prices to drop  in  versus  we believe the companys increased risk profile and the lower guidance for  is about fairly reflected in ryns recent  share price given our  target and the stocks  prospective combined yield we would hold the shares at  or above we would sell on the other hand if the stock were to fall to  or below we would consider once again upgrading the shares to buy as the indicated total return would exceed  or higher valuation we developed our  target price for shares of ryn using the average of  methods  break up value discounted by  on an enterprise value basis to reflect status as a publiclytraded company and  dcf break up value we developed our  target price for ryn based on a discount to private market value ryn owned or held under decadeslong leases approximately  million acres of timberlands in the us at the end of  which on a blended basis are worth approximately  per acre or a total of  billion adding in the  billion estimated value of the performance fibers ram business the  million in net working capital and the  million nz joint venture value yields a total private market value of  billion applying a  discount to this  billion private market value leads to a public enterprise value of  billion we believe a  enterprise value discount adequately reflects ryns after the pf business spin standing as a public company plus the uncertainty surrounding liquidity for future timberland transactions and their valuations in ryns regions backing out  billion in net debt and  million in pension and other retirement liabilities we derive a public equity value of  billion dividing this  billion by the  million diluted shares outstanding we derive a  target price figure  rayoniers estimated private market value source risi company reports and vertical research partners discounted cash flows we then calculate a  target pricing using our dcf model which assumes a  risk free rate based on the year us treasury bond and applies a  wacc and a x terminal multiple to our forecasted cash flows averaging the results of calculating a price target using these two methods we arrive at our  oneyear target price risks risks to our  target price on ryn being exceeded are that timberland values increase in coming years versus our expectations of flattodown values as longerterm interest rates rise demand for wood products and thus timber recovers significantly faster than we expect or the dollar weakens significantly versus other currencies improving the cost advantage of us timber in addition should specialty dissolving and fluff pulp demand and thus prices rise faster than we are anticipating shares of ryn may perform better than we are anticipating in addition a substantial and prolonged jump in fossilfuel prices could make woodbased alternative fuels more attractive thus bolstering company earnings and perceived timberland values on the other hand risks to our target price not being reached or maintained are timberland values decline more than we currently anticipate demand for wood products and thus timber recovers significantly less than we expect and the dollar strengthens significantly versus other currencies hurting the cost advantage of us timberbased products in addition should specialty dissolving pulp demand and thus prices not decline faster or rise slower than we are anticipating over time shares of ryn and the tobespunoff rayonier advanced materials business may not perform as well as we are reflecting in our oneyear
