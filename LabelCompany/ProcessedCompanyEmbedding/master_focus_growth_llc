shortsale proceeds in other investments performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost all returns assume reinvestment of all dividends performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the

yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the funds nav at the end of the period some blackrock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end
