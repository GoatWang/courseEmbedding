commonly abounds in these routine processes with the typical manufacturing business seeing  percent service companies  percent and governmental agencies suffering from as much as  percent waste the way routine work is executed is the result of years of momentum–in contrast to a conscious and purposeful design removing the waste is problematic because no one “owns” the process and it gets more challenging because the effectiveness efficiency and timeliness of the process is not measured and thus is unknown using a set of proprietary methods and tools mass ingenuity® consultants facilitate creation of the organization’s now fundamentals map it is the first step in the process to move the ownership of the routine work to the people who do that work it is also the foundation for

and the now management system® microlevel process improvement to drive out waste many organizations use process improvement to save money better leverage resources and improve the customer experience process improvement is designed to drive out waste waste is generated from activities that do not add value to the customer research shows that in most manufacturing organizations  of activities are waste in most service organizations it is  and in government it is estimated to be at least  unfortunately these numbers have not declined even in the wake of the many different management techniques that have come along in the past  years there are three primary reasons that process improvement efforts do not live up to expectations and do not achieve the intended outcomes  process improvement projects are randomly selected and are not focused on the highestleverage processes in need of improvement the primary reason  employees and managers lack the ability to conduct process improvement projects that permanently drive out waste  employees and managers lack shared process improvement tools methods and language fortunately these issues can be mitigated by installing the now management system® and then realizing the full promise of process improvement macrolevel process improvement for management ironically few processes display more variation and waste than the “management” process our experience has proven that if an organization conducts macrolevel process improvement for the “mother of all processes”—actually managing the enterprise—then microlevel process improvement is significantly more powerful the chief indicators of management variation are employee confusion and waste we have identified the “ deadly sins of management” as the source of tremendous management variation which prevent the “now” response that customers expect  lack of clear direction  no line of sight connection  unclear expectations and accountability  inconsistent language  poor issue transparency  insufficient resources  inadequate toolsskills organizations that utilize traditional management methods are out of step with our modern economy employees’ mindset and customer
