popular sectors   consumers continue to seek out convenience products and goodforyou products often from brands and retailers new to their shopping lists  dollar stores are taking an increasingly larger share of the marketplace and big box retailers like walmart and target have become grocery destinations   last april the seats were filled at our food and beverage conference focusing on new consumer preferences  this year the capital roundtable is assembling allnew content that will thoroughly cover the challenges of  for buyers of middlemarket food and beverage companies            that’s why you’ll want to reserve the date of thursday april  to           attend our ninth annual daylong conference on “private equity investing          in food  beverage companies”            what’s more we’ve taken note of today’s emphasis on value you can          enjoy our early bird rate  a savings of   when you make your          reservations for this conference by march

consulting and wealth management services          no matter what anyone suggests succeeding in  and beyond is all about operations  money is not as much a scarce resource as management  you need to have strong controls over every dime spent  if you don’t monitor carefully such details as trade spending where things can quickly get out of hand your real numbers can be far less than what you were anticipating   and while food costs have come down over the last year making inflation less of a worry you still have to pay close attention to your margins  with dollar stores and value retailers taking such a large slice of the marketplace you may be aiming for a rockbottom price point that either protects your existing business or helps you bid business away from incumbents at contract renewal time  yet should commodities rise you can get into serious trouble    food and beverage experts bring you a º view of the possibilities   to guide you through recent changes and coming trends we are pleased to have joan mccabe and ian mactaggart managing partners of brynwood partners return as our conference cochairs  brynwood is a greenwich ct middlemarket private equity that acquires

discussions will feature  knowledgeable pe experts in the food  beverage sector including gps portfolio company operating executives investment bankers lenders consultants and more  they will share their realworld perspectives lessons learned and industry outlooks including insights on recent deal activity and managing current portfolio companies   one area that continues to offer appealing opportunities is private label  consumers especially younger shoppers are no longer loyal to the brands they grew up with  quite the opposite because this business is so highly fragmented if you can grow a private label company successfully you can practically count on a profitable exit   convenience is also a key dynamic over the next five to ten years as onthego consumers seek out products that fit their lifestyles  handheld products particularly breakfast items have seen dramatic growth of late  and the innovators in the category have been small food businesses not the majors who had to play catchup when it came to breakfast burritos   some of the major activity in  included acquisitions of privatelyheld companies by industry giants  confectionery brookside foods was purchased by hershey pretzelmaker national pretzel was purchased by conagra and ultrapremium beverage brand tea forté and sausage brand aidells were purchased by sara lee   in the growing frozen food category
