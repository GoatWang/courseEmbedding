erik nitsche from  electric boatedit main article general dynamics electric boat general dynamics traces its ancestry to john philip hollands holland torpedo boat company this company was responsible for developing the us navys first submarines built at lewis nixons crescent shipyard located in elizabethport new jersey the revolutionary submarine boat holland vi was built there its keel being laid down in  crescents superintendent and naval architect arthur leopold busch supervised the construction of this submarine after being launched on  may  it was eventually purchased by the navy and renamed uss holland ss the holland was officially commissioned on  october  and became the united states navys first submarine later known as ss the navy placed an order for more submarines which were developed in rapid succession and were assembled at two different locations on both coasts these submarines were known as the aclass or adder class and became americas first fleet of underwater craft at the beginning of the th century holland grew short on funds due to the lengthy and expensive process of introducing the worlds first practical submarines and he had to part with his company and sell his interest to financier isaac leopold rice renaming the new firm as the electric boat company on  february  holland effectively lost control of the company and found himself earning a salary of  a week as chief engineer while the company that he founded was selling submarines for  eachcitation needed holland resigned from the company effective april  rice became electric boats first president remaining there from that time until  when he stepped down just prior to his death on  november  electric boat gained a reputation for unscrupulous arms dealing in  when it sold submarines to japans imperial japanese navy and russias imperial russian navy who were then at war holland submarines were also sold to the british royal navy through the english armaments company vickers and to the dutch to serve in the royal netherlands navy the new pioneering craft originally developed by the company was now legitimized as genuine naval weapons by the worlds most powerful navies in the postworld war ii winddown electric boat was cashflush but lacking in work with its workforce shrinking from  to  by citation needed hoping to diversify president and chief executive officer john jay hopkins started looking for companies that would fit into electric boats market canadair purchaseedit hopkins quickly found that canadair owned by the canadian government was suffering from similar postwar malaise and was up for sale hopkins bought the company for  million in  even by the canadian governments calculations the factory alone was worth more than  millioncitation needed excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts when electric boat purchased canadair its production line and inventory systems were in disorder hopkins hired canadianborn massproduction specialist h oliver west to take over the presidents role and return canadair to profitability shortly after the takeover canadair began delivering its new canadair north star a version of the douglas dc and was able to deliver aircraft to transcanada airlines canadian pacific airlines and british overseas airways corporation boac well in advance of their contracted delivery timescitation needed as defense spending increased with the onset of the cold war canadair went on to win many canadian military contracts for the royal canadian air force and became a major aerospace company these included canadair t trainer the canadair argus longrange maritime reconnaissance and transport aircraft and the canadair f sabre between  and   sabres were built canadair also produced  cf starfighter supersonic fighter aircraft a licensebuilt version of the lockheed f in  canadair was sold back to the canadian government which sold it to bombardier inc in  general dynamics emergesedit as the aircraft production at canadair became increasingly important to the company hopkins argued that the name electric boat was no longer appropriate on  april  electric boat was reorganized as general dynamics general dynamics was still flush with cash after the canadair purchase and given the success of that company it continued to look for new aviation purchasescitation needed in march  it purchased convair from the atlas group the sale was approved by government oversight with the proviso that general dynamics would continue to operate out of air force plant  in fort worth texas this factory was set up in order to spread out strategic aircraft production and rented to convair during the war to produce b liberator bombers over time the fort worth plant became convairs major production centercitation needed as was the case with canadair convair worked as an independent division under the general dynamics umbrella over the next decade the company introduced the f delta dart interceptor the b hustler and the convair  and  airliners convair also introduced the atlas missile platform the first us operational intercontinental ballistic missile management churnedit hopkins fell seriously ill during  and was eventually replaced by frank pace later that year meanwhile john naish succeeded joseph mcnarney as president of convair henry crown became the companys largest shareholder and merged his material service corporation with gd in  naish left in may  taking most of convairs top people with himcitation needed gd subsequently reorganized into eastern group in new york city and western group in san diego california with the latter taking over all of the aerospace activities and dropping the convair brand name from its aircraft in the processcitation needed frank pace retired under pressure in  and roger lewis former assistant secretary of the air force and pan american airways ceo was brought in as ceo the company recovered then fell back into the same struggles in  the board brought in mcdonnell douglas president dave lewis no relation as chairman and ceo who served until retiring in  aviation powerhouseedit during the early s the company bid on the united states air forces tfx tactical fighter experimental project for a new lowlevel penetrator robert mcnamara newly installed as the secretary of defense forced a merger of the tfx with us navy plans for a new longrange fleet defender aircraft in order to bid on a naval version successfully gd partnered with grumman who would build a customized version for aircraft carrier duties after four rounds of bids and changes the gdgrumman team finally won the contract over a boeing submission the f first flew in december  the fb flew in may  but the navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carrierscitation needed with an unacceptable navy version estimates for  fs including exports were sharply reduced but gd still managed to make a million profit on the projectcitation needed grumman went on to use many of the innovations of the f in the highly successful f tomcat an aircraft designed solely as a carrierborne fighter reorganizationedit in may  gd reorganized into  operating divisions based on product lines the board decided to build all future planes in fort worth ending plane production at convairs original plant in san diego but continuing with space and missile development there in october  roger lewis left and david s lewis from mcdonnell douglas was named ceo lewis required that the company headquarters move to st louis missouri which occurred in february  f successedit in  gd bid on the usafs lightweight fighter lwf project gd and northrop were awarded prototype contracts gds f program was winding down and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract it organized its own version of lockheeds famed skunk works the advanced concepts laboratory and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating modern equipment gds yf first flew in january  and proved to have slightly better performance than the yf in headtohead testing it entered production as the f in january  with an initial order of  and a total order of  the f also won contracts worldwide beating the f in foreign competition as well gd built an aircraft production factory in fort worth texas f orders eventually totaled more than

line announcing tuesday that it had purchased a cyber products division of phoenixbased advatech pacific inc through this acquisition general dynamics will add advatech’s tacds and centurioncds products terms of the deal were not disclosed enlarge general dynamics corp announced tuesday that it had purchased a cyber products division… more andrew harrer tacds is a small rugged device outfitted to military vehicles ground systems and aircraft that allows for the automated exchange of sensitive tactical information from the battlefield centurioncds similarly is a device that transfers secure data and is typically equipped to deployed soldiers’ communications and computer equipment as well as small drones general dynamics’ current family of cyber products are a part of its mission systems division which is included in its information systems and technology business more specifically cyber products are part of its mobile communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr solutions group the portfolio includes a number of products aimed at protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure communications general dynamics’ ist division differs from other it services businesses in the industry in that it includes a large hardware component— primarily communications devices used intheater because of its large mix of products general dynamics ist business enjoys high operating margins as products are typically more profitable than services throughout  the company was able to offset losses in its it services work with increases from its command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance cisr products division in the last six months of  cisr product revenue grew  million over the same period last year — whereas it services fell  million cisr was bolstered largely from orders under its warfighter information networktactical program delivering communications hardware to soldiers the first quarter of  marked what could be the beginning of a troubling trend as cisr product revenue was down  million compared to the same quarter last year and it services fell  million company executives blamed the slowdown on the transition to the administration of president donald trump but joey cresta a government it company analyst at technology business research inc said it could be an indication that ist is gearing up for a hit to its margins he said it could be that the armys demand for communications devices has been satiated at the same time general dynamics has been scoring a lot of big wins in it services beginning in february the company won contracts totaling  million and  million with the defense intelligence agency a  million award from nato and a  million contract with the indian health service a subagency within the department of health and human services cresta said that for general dynamics’ ist division acquiring more cyber products gives it a shot in the arm for ” and could help stem losses in the cisr division if those extend beyond the first quarter general dynamics hasn’t been too terribly active lately when it comes to acquisitions it was a quiet year in  and then in  the company made two purchases quincy massachusettsbased unmanned underwater vehicle manufacturer bluefin robotics and los angelesbased aircraft management and charter services provider avjet corp to this point the company’s cybersecurity products have been developed internally not through acquisitions — making the advatech buy somewhat unusual their portfolio development in cybersecurity has as far as i can tell been largely organic over the last few years” cresta said “despite being inactive in cyber up until this point on the acquisition front general dynamics has still managed to emerge as one of the stronger cybersecurity providers to the federal government” “this further enhances that” he added related content general dynamics ceo it biz to recover following q slowdown analyst trump
