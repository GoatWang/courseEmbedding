and development of new krill oilbased forms of omega phospholipid therapies for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases acasti’s lead drug candidate capre has completed two phase  bioavailability and pharmacokinetic trials in healthy volunteers and two phase  clinical trials in patients with hypertriglyceridemia capre is a krill oilderived mixture of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas primarily composed of omega fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha which are present as a combination of phospholipid esters and free fatty acids krill oila natural advantage sourced from krill oil capre® seeks to reduce triglycerides while also potentially providing beneficial effects on ldlc and hdlc in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia since  acasti pharma has focused on addressing a critical market need for an effective safe and wellabsorbing omega therapeutic that can make a positive impact on the major blood lipids associated with cardiovascular disease risk  –  of omegas in capre are naturally bound to phospholipids and the other half are “free” fatty acids – both forms are more efficiently absorbed pharmaceutical omegas derived from fish oils currently on the market by contrast are typically “esterified” meaning the triglycerides are removed and the omegas are chemically linked to ethyl esters derivatives not found in nature for optimal bioavailability of esterified omegas patients must consume the product with a fatty meal however hypertriglyceridemic patients are typically advised to follow low fat diets the bioavailability of capre is not meaningfully affected by the fat content of a meal consumed prior to drug administration enabling patients with hypertriglyceridemia to remain on track with their physicianrecommended diet trial results addressing the major lipids in hypertriglyceridemia in both phase  clinical trials “trifecta” and “colt” capre was found to be safe and well tolerated at all doses tested with no serious adverse events that were considered treatment related under both trials capre significantly lowered triglycerides in patients with mild to severe hypertriglyceridemia but more importantly capre also has demonstrated no deleterious effect on levels of “bad” cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol or ldlc further the phase  data indicated that capre may potentially reduce ldlc ldlc is undesirable because it accumulates in the walls of blood vessels where it can cause blockages atherosclerosis  in these studies capre also reduced nonhdlc which includes all cholesterol contained in the bloodstream except hdlc and is considered to be a useful marker of cardiovascular disease the colt data showed a mean increase of  in hdlc with capre at  grams a day p further studies are required to demonstrate statistical significance with hdlc the trifecta trial confirmed and supported the positive phase  colt results on the safety and efficacy of capre for the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia the trifecta trial’s primary endpoint was met with patients on  gram or  grams of capre achieving a statistically significant mean placeboadjusted decrease in triglycerides from baseline in addition no deleterious effect on ldlc bad cholesterol and a reduction in nonhdlc were observed without safety concerns acasti presents at th world congress on heart disease july   topic phase ii open label trial results acasti presents at national lipid association scientific sessions may   topic phase ii open label colt trial results a novel composition and formulation capre® acasti’s prescription drug candidate is a highly purified omega phospholipid concentrate derived from krill oil  acasti’s growing global patent portfolio encompasses capre and its composition until expiration in  acasti currently holds  composition of matter and method of use patents in the us china japan and australia with an additional  patents pending in  countries capre regulatory strategy in  acasti completed a comparative bioavailability bridging study comparing capre to the marketed omega prescription drug lovaza as a means of establishing a scientific bridge between the two  the study successfully met its primary objective which is expected to support acasti’s strategy to pursue the us food and drug administration’s b regulatory pathway for approval this regulatory pathway allows the applicant to streamline the overall development program required to support a new drug application nda by relying on the safety data of an approved drug by referencing substantial clinical and nonclinical data already available with lovaza acasti intends to be able to streamline the overall capre development program required to support the nda submission the company aims to meet with the fda in early  to confirm this regulatory approach and to finalize the protocol for the phase  trial needed for nda approval the company’s next step is to complete all remaining clinical manufacturing and regulatory activities to be “phase ready” acasti’s openlabel randomized fourway crossover bioavailability study the bridging study compared capre given as a single dose of  grams in fasting and fed states with the approved hypertriglyceridemia drug lovaza omegaacid ethyl esters in  healthy volunteers the study met its primary objective and demonstrated that the levels of omega fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha following administration of capre did not exceed the levels following administration of lovaza in subjects who were fed a highfat meal these results are expected to support the basis for claiming a comparable safety profile of the two products subject to confirmation with the fda at the end of phase  meeting among subjects in the fasting state capre demonstrated better bioavailability than lovaza as measured by superior blood levels of epa and dha based on the results obtained in another pharmacokinetic study cap the bioavailability of capre is not meaningfully affected by the fat content of a meal consumed prior to drug administration we believe this could represent a significant clinical and marketing advantage over lovaza and feature of capre since the administration with a lowfat meal represents a more appropriate regimen for patients with hypertriglyceridemia who follow a physicianrecommended restricted diet other key elements of acasti’s strategy include pursuing development andor distribution partnerships to support the commercialization of capre in the united states and in other global markets acasti may pursue strategic opportunities including licensing or similar transactions joint ventures partnerships strategic alliances or alternative financing transactions to provide development capital market access and other strategic sources of capital for acasti however we cannot assure when or whether acasti will pursue any such strategic opportunities scroll to top contact – acasti

currently acasti has a leading prescription drug candidate capre® and a medical food product onemia® which is being marketed by neptune onemia® is acasti’s first product to be marketed to healthcare practitioners as a medical food onemia® is only administered under the supervision of a physician and is intended for the specific dietary management of illnesses associated with omega phospholipid deficiency related to cardiometabolic disorders onemia® consists of concentrated omega phospholipids and antioxidants purified from krill oil at a concentration which is considerably higher than that found in neptune krill oil nko® medical foods are a specific class of products under the us food and drug administration fda and are defined by them as “a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements based on recognized scientific principles are established by medical evaluation” onemia® is being positioned as a product of choice in a multimilliondollar market targeting the clinical dietary management of cardiometabolic disorders nonclinical studies conducted by acasti supported by clinical testing conducted on neptune krill oil nko® have shown onemia® to be safe and effective for the dietary management of omega phospholipids deficiency and the related abnormal lipid profiles and cardiometabolic disorders abnormal lipid profiles can lead to a number of conditions including hyperlipidemia which generally manifests as high ldl bad cholesterol and high triglycerides atherosclerosis the buildup of plaque on the inside of blood vessels diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and gastroenterology disorders in januray  acasti entered into a nonexclusive licensing agreement in which neptune will market onemia® on a best commercial efforts basis given neptunes sales and marketing leadership in the krilloil market acasti believes that neptune is best placed to market onemia®s agreement this will also allow acasti to focus its energy and resources on the development of capre® please visit onemias official web site  wwwonemiacom acasti has an exclusive licence from neptune to develop pharmaceutical products customized to manage cardiovascular disease capre® is currently acasti’s only prescription drug candidate that is being developed for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia a condition which is characterized by abnormally high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream capre® is patent protected and derived from krill oil for the prevention and treatment of certain cardiometabolic disorders more specifically hypertriglyceridemia the active ingredient of capre® is a mixture of concentrated omega fatty acids purified from krill oil and developed as an oral formulation capre® contains epa and dha bound to phospholipids as well as free epa and dha acasti’s nearterm strategy is to develop and commercialize capre® in the united states as a prescription drug with a claim for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and as a next step the treatment of mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia going forward acasti hopes capre® can be used as a therapy in conjunction with positive lifestyle changes and administered either alone or with other treatments such as statins statins are a class of drug used to reduce cholesterol levels and potentially for use by statinintolerant or statinresistant patients there are competing products in the marketplace to treat hypertriglyceridemia including products that have been manufactured from omega fish oil and products that if approved would compete with capre® however considerable medical needs remain in the multibillion dollar hypertriglyceridemia market market participants including the american heart association have estimated that onethird of the us population has elevated levels of triglycerides acasti believes that there will be increased growth in the prescription omega market based on the expected introduction and resulting increased promotion and awareness of new prescription omega products as well as the emergence of new clinical data regarding the efficacy of omega in the treatment and prevention of cardiometabolic disorders     acasti pharma inc private company information

of class a shares to nept nept currently owns  percent of acst best in class results from its phase ii open label study colt were released on august   the study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of capre in the treatment of mild to severe hypertriglyceridemia a condition in which triglyceride levels are elevated elevated triglyceride levels can lead to serious health issues such as heart attack and stroke an overview of the condition can be found here over  patients in the study received capre for  to  weeks daily doses of g and g were used and both were shown to be safe and effective an increased benefit was found for an increase in dosage and duration patients treated with g for  weeks showed a mean triglyceride decrease of  percent from baseline while patients treated with g for  weeks showed a mean triglyceride decrease of  percent each group showed an absolute mean improvement of  percent and  percent respectively as compared to standard of care drilling down on the g for  weeks group shows a mean ldl bad cholesterol decrease of  percent and nonhdl decrease of  percent the g for  weeks group showed an hdl good cholesterol increase of  percent over the standard of care another critical piece of the study is that  percent of the population had baseline triglycerides between  and  mgdl borderline to high people with triglycerides ≥ mgdl fall into the very high group market size and competition currently there are no fda approved omega prescription drugs for the direct treatment of people with triglycerides between  mgdl and  mgdl this is significant because this group makes up about  million people in the us alone global sales of prescription omega  drugs exceeded  billion in  forecasts of prescriptions written for omega  drugs in  are around  million and are expected to grow to  million by  the big players in the prescription grade omega market with drugs in the commercialization stage are lovaza vascepa and epanova these drugs are produced by glaxosmithkline plc nysegsk amarin corporation plc nasdaqamrn and astrazeneca plc nyseazn respectively see the table below comparing each drug to capre green is good and red is bad midpoints were used when only a range was reported in the results keep in mind that the results below for the commercialized drugs are from phase iii while capres is from an open label phase ii study regardless i believe this provides a reasonable comparison for the drugs most of capres results are from the  mgdl to  mgdl group while the other trials focused on the ≥ mgdl group the length of the trials are fairly similar ranging from  weeks to  weeks from the comparison below it is apparent that capre is on par with the current drugs on the market at the very least no serious health complications were noted during the colt trial lovaza trials vascepa trials epanova trials product differentiation capre contains about  percent phospholipids and  percent epadha lovaza and epanova contain both epa and dha while vascepa is only contains epa results of the eclipse study showed that epanova has a superior bioavailability compared to lovaza what differentiates capre from the other three drugs is that it has the potential to treat triglycerides ldl and hdl capre may be superior to lovaza due to its ability to lower ldls while lovaza increases ldls in addition the results of the colt study were mostly related to the  mgdl to  mgdl group while the commercialized drug results were mostly based on the ≥ mgdl group it has been shown that triglycerides are reduced at a greater percentage using omega drugs when at elevated levels as found in the very severe group this means that capres triglyceride reduction may have been even greater had their colt trial included more patients in the very severe group its worth noting that lovaza and the others can be prescribed for off label uses vascepa is in a phase iii study reduceit for use in the  mgdl to  mgdl group while on a statin and has an estimated completion date of november  the primary endpoint is to determine the effect of g per day for preventing the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event vascepa only has a  year market exclusivity but is suing the fda to get the  year status that comes with nce a discussion of the issues at hand can be found here this creates a risk for capre should the fda reject nce exclusivity however i do not feel this will happen since capre contains about  percent phospholipids and lower levels of epa acst has filed a composition and use patent application with the uspto and is still awaiting the allowance if granted the patent would be good through  capre is currently in another phase ii study trifecta this one is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study the purpose of this  week study is to determine whether daily doses of g or g of capre has an effect on fasting plasma triglycerides in patients with mild to high hypertriglyceridemia as compared to a placebo estimated enrollment for this study is  and the estimated completion date is june  on january   acst announced that the fda has granted it approval to initiate a pharmacokinetic trial of capre the pk trial is expected to start in q  and results are expected in q  acst is using quintiles for its pk trial and this will ensure that a highquality trial is conducted acst plans to seek fda approval to initiate a pivotal phase iii study of capre in the us i was unable to find an exact timeline for the initiation of phase iii assuming the trifecta and pk trial results are positive phase iii could be initiated by early  based on my estimates financials for the ninemonths ended november   acst reported revenues of  versus  for the corresponding period ended november   revenues for both years were generated from onemia as of november   acst had about  million in cash and shortterm investments and a current ratio of about  it has no longterm debt and most of its current liabilities are payable to nept its cash burn rate is about  per quarter but this will most likely increase due to its trifecta and pk trials and other operating activities on december   acst issued  million class a shares at  per share and  million warrants with an exercise price of  total proceeds of about  million were received each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share the company also has another  million warrants outstanding with an exercise price of  on february   acst sold more shares and warrants with an issuance price of  and exercise price of  total proceeds from this offering was about  million as of november   acst had about  million shares outstanding valuation precedent transaction analysis acst has a market capitalization of about  million at the time of writing this article in may  astrazeneca acquired omthera pharmaceuticals for  million and gained access to epanova omthera shareholders also received contingent value rights valued at about  million this brings the total potential acquisition price to  million epanova had completed two phase iii studies with positive results prior to the acquisition this comparison will become more important if positive results are reported from trifecta and capre enters a pivotal phase iii discounted cash flow analysis for  lovaza recognized sales of about  million while vascepa recognized sales of about  million analyst estimates of vascepa sales were based on the massive growth rate of lovaza during its commercial launch back in  a good discussion of this can be found here lovaza had firstmover advantage which was one of the keys to its explosive growth although capre has the potential to be a blockbuster drug if its trial results continue to show superior efficacy and safety this does not guarantee its commercial success capre still needs to make it through phase iii and obtain fda approval this has its risks which need to be factored into the discount rate the company will most likely need to raise additional capital in the future for its clinical development and operations and this will cause further dilution to shareholders assuming capre does obtain fda approval commercialization will be a challenge due to the competition in the marketplace and the potential for the expected market growth to not occur the growth could stall if doctors begin writing less omega drug prescriptions due to doubts about its positive effect on the heart a recent article on this can be found here the reduceit study results will hopefully shed some light on this debate lastly there are many overthecounter omega brands on the market and this could eat into capres future market share a partnership with a larger pharmaceutical company with sufficient financial resources and marketing expertise would be ideal for acst but its too early in the game to tell if this will happen assuming a commercial launch of capre in early  with annual sales of  million a yearoveryear sales growth rate of  percent a discount rate of  percent and total free cash flow of about  billion for the period of  to  this puts acst at  based on  million shares outstanding its worth noting that euro pacific capital has a  price target on the stock and this could be due to a lower discount rate andor a different free cash flow estimate technical analysis the stock seems to have been forming a rectangle bottom since november  this could be indicative of accumulation before the markup phase the stock seems to be stuck between a range of about  to  the warrants with an exercise price of  may act as resistance until the trifecta readout however a runup prior to the results is not out of the question the height of the potential rectangle bottom is about  and the measured move objective is  assuming the breakout level is  conclusion the recent selloff in the biotechnology industry has created some great buying opportunities i believe acst has great potential due to its drug capre the stock price could rise significantly if its trifecta results are positive if the results do not meet the primary endpoint the stock price could drop significantly based on the colt results i think this scenario is not as likely the omega prescription drug market is very promising but has some risk this is an important year for capre and other drugs in this market and it will be exciting to

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care
