hotchkis  wiley value opportunities fund q  commentaryfebruary    about lsedlg  wfc  cof  hwaix  market commentary the sp  index returned  in  its sixth consecutive positive year—the longest such streak since the mid to late s unlike the extended bull market of the s which was driven by irrational growth expectations and swelling pricetoearnings multiples the stock market’s rise over the past six years has been powered by broad corporate earnings growth moreover household debt has been reduced by about  and corporate debt has been more than halved—an unprecedented deleveraging cycle that has derisked the market considerably stock prices are up earnings are higher balance sheets are stronger interest rates are lower and inflation remains subdued the us economy has demonstrated clear progress though growth in europe asia and emerging markets has somewhat disappointed taking into account the confluence of these factors we find the broad equity market reasonably valued for the risks at hand it is neither especially compelling nor overextended we have identified valuation opportunities selectively as demonstrated by the portfolio’s discount to the market but we remain highly reluctant to assume undue risk the portfolio trades at x our estimate of normalsustainable earnings compared to the sp  index trading at x normal earnings and x next year’s consensus earnings we remain keenly focused not only on valuation support as a primary risk control but also on strong balance sheets sustainable cash flows and prudent use of capital warning gurufocus has detected  warning signs with lsedlg click here to check it out lsedlg year financial datathe intrinsic value of lsedlgpeter lynch chart of lsedlgcrude oil prices tumbled  during  precipitated by concerns about economic growth in developing economies ie shrinking demand without a corresponding slowdown in production from the world’s major oil producers ie excess supply commodity price changes should not affect total economic growth globally but net importers benefit at the expense of net exporters when crude oil prices plummet accordingly equities in the us western europe and developed asia performed significantly better than equities in oil producing countries such as russia and brazil also performance disparity was significant between sectors because the energy sector lagged by a sizable margin during the year sp  index energy stocks returned  as a group making it the only sector with a negative return in december the bureau of economic analysis revised real us gross domestic product growth to a  annual rate for the quarter ended  this was on the heels of a  real growth rate in the previous quarter and marked the fastest pace in more than a decade the primary driver was increased consumer spending but business investment exports and government spending also increased also in  the unemployment rate dipped below  for the first time in six years and consumer confidence hit a sevenyear high against this backdrop the us dollar appreciated relative to other major global currencies the dollar was up  versus the euro  versus the pound and  versus the yen an improved economy robust corporate earnings and lower financial leverage provide a solid foundation for the equity market though stock prices have increased commensurately amenable conditions can persist for long periods though we remain somewhat guarded in the current environment we have identified attractive valuation opportunities selectively while emphasizing appropriate risk controls and are optimistic regarding the portfolio’s resulting riskreturn profile attribution  the hotchkis  wiley value opportunities fund class i underperformed the sp  in  in broad terms the underperformance can be attributed to two factors  foreign currency exposure and  small cap exposure the pound euro and yen each declined relative to the us dollar over the year the portfolio’s gross exposure averaged a little more than  during the year between  and  of the currency exposure was hedged which helped but the net exposure outside the us was a detractor also the portfolio’s average small cap exposure was about  throughout the year this detracted from performance considerably as small caps underperformed large caps measured by the russell  and sp  indexes by the largest margin since  portfolio activity  the portfolio’s exposure to high yield bonds increased over the year as we identified several high yielding credits with what we believe were attractive riskreturn profiles the allocation increased from about  to nearly  energy or energy related bonds comprise a large portion of the increased high yield exposure we also added several risk arbitrage equity positions which account for nearly  of the portfolio as of yearend we had none at the beginning of the year our largest sector increase in the general stock portfolio was in healthcare as we added new positions in pharmaceuticals medical devices and pharmacy benefit management we decreased the weight in financials primarily by exitingtrimming the positions in direct line insurance lsedlg  wells fargo nysewfc   and capital one financial nysecof   of total portfolio as of december   mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible investing in nondiversified funds andor smaller andor mediumsized companies involves greater risks than those associated with investing in diversified funds andor large company stocks such as business risk significant stock price fluctuations sector concentration and illiquidity the fund is nondiversified meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund the fund may invest in etfs which are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds including the risks that the market price of an etf’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value nav an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade which may impact a fund’s ability to sell its shares the fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise this risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities investment by the fund in lowerrated and nonrated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higherrated securities the fund may invest in derivative securities which derive their performance from the performance of an underlying asset index interest rate or currency exchange rate derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks depending on the characteristics of the particular derivative it could become illiquid fund holdings andor sector allocations are subject to change and are
