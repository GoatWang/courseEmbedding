hereby there will be an additional underwriting commission paid to the underwriter in the amount of  per unit  on the amount below  invested by investors introduced by us which will not affect the amount in trust due to the obligation of our initial shareholders to purchase commission units no discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private units  the amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at  even if the overallotment is exercised in addition interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  over a month period assuming an interest rate of approximately  per year  these are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would be deducted from our excess working capital an affiliate of richard xu our executive chairman and chief executive officer has committed to purchase an aggregate of  private units at a price of  per unit  in the aggregate this affiliate has also agreed that if investors introduced by us to the underwriter do not purchase at least  of the

paid to any of our existing officers directors shareholders or any of their affiliates prior to or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of the business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after a business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately  in addition interest earned on the funds held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination we intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto to the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient richard xu and chen liu have agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of march   lodestar investment holdings i llc an affiliate of richard xu loaned to us an aggregate of  to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for sec registration fee finra filing fee the nonrefundable portion of the nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses in april  lodestar investment holdings i llc loaned us an additional  the loans are payable without interest on the earlier of i october   ii the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or iii the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering the loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds which includes amounts that may be released to us from the trust account to operate for the next  months assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time however if necessary in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering our initial shareholders officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of  per unit which for example would result in the holders being issued  ordinary shares if  of notes were so converted since the  rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of  ordinary shares upon the closing of our business combination our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete our initial business combination the loans would not be repaid a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on his her or its portion of the trust account to the extent not previously released to us only in the event of i our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required time period or ii if that public shareholder converts such shares in connection with a business combination which we consummate or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or prebusiness combination activity in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses • our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination may delay the completion of a transaction • our obligation to convert ordinary shares held by our public shareholders but not our initial shareholders or nontendering investors with respect to up to  ordinary shares purchased in this offering may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination • nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination • our outstanding rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent • our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to  of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates • our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private units and underlying securities and any securities issued to our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans and • the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase recapitalization reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to as a “target business” or entering into contractual arrangements that give us control over such a target business while our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world we initially intend to focus our search on target businesses located in the people’s republic of china as well as the hong kong special administrative region and the macau special administrative region but not taiwan which we refer collectively throughout this prospectus as “china” or the “prc” that operate in the ecommerce and consumer retail industry we believe that companies that operate in the ecommerce and consumer retail industry in china will perform favorably over the next decade due to the following reasons • rising spending power of chinese consumers • china’s online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated • an increase in categories of products and services online • increased usage of mobile devices • china’s offline retail market faces significant challenges • offline retailers are starting to use online marketplaces to grow their business • growth in china’s consumption • growth in the number of people in china that have access to the internet and • greater availability of goods online across consumption categories we do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf directly or indirectly contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions formal or otherwise with respect to such a transaction accordingly we may not be able to locate a suitable or attractive target business to consummate an initial business combination with we will have until  months from the consummation of this offering to consummate our initial business combination if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account pro rata to the holders of the ordinary shares which are being sold as part of the units in this public offering whether they are purchased in the public offering or in the aftermarket by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs pursuant to the nasdaq listing rules our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to  of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses the fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community such as actual and potential sales earnings cash flow andor book value the target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of  of the trust account balance we are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least  of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own we currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target whether through outright ownership or through contractual arrangements or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act the government of the prc has restricted or limited foreign ownership of certain kinds of assets and companies operating in a wide variety of industries including some online and mobile commerce businesses accordingly we may need to structure our transaction to acquire a target business using contractual arrangements through variable interest entities which are entities  owned by chinese citizens even if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the posttransaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital shares of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the  of net assets test if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us all of our officers and directors currently have certain preexisting fiduciary duties or contractual obligations additionally each of richard xu our executive chairman and chief executive officer peiling amy he our chief
