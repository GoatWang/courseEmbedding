preston d mcswain say it ain’t so joe – again “no largecap midcap or smallcap funds managed to remain in the top quartile at the end of the fiveyear measurement period” this is one of the findings out this week from sp  dow jones related to “the ability of topperforming funds to maintain their status” and persist as top performing funds for many of us who have been in the industry for many years this type of finding is hard to take as i wrote in a 0 piece titled say it ain’t so joe sometimes i feel like the little guy in the movie “field of dreams” until founding fiduciary wealth partners in  i spent my career promoting actively managed funds i believed in them i was quite good at selling them i received an award one year for selling record amounts of active equity for the firm i worked for at the time now i sometimes wonder “was i wrong all those years   how can this be” like the little boy who had learned of shoeless joe jackson’s involvement in throwing the  world series negative news about something we have believed in for many years is hard to take in the past active management was the only game on wall street and managers with hot hands were put on pedestals many of us grew up in an investment world that was dominated by reports of star active portfolio managers such as warren buffett or peter lynch like most anyone i believe that people who work harder should have an advantage as with many things however it is not all about working harder you need to work smarter not let emotion get the better of you and stay focused on the evidence about what works consistently over multiple longterm periods what does the evidence now consistently show “the best way to own common stocks is through index funds” – warren buffett berkshire hathaway  shareholder letter and “all the time and effort people devote to picking the right fund the hot hand the great manager have in most cases led to no advantage” – peter lynch beat the street  i have been drafting another piece which i will publish soon that might dispel some myths about index funds and counter the active managers who are sure to continue protesting loudly about how the promotion of index funds is worse than the “misuse of antibiotics” i’ll keep this short and simple this time however and just finish with a 0 quote from another wellrespected data analysis firm morningstar “in most cases the odds of picking a future longterm active management winner from the best performing quintile in each category aren’t materially different than selecting from the bottom quintile” yes it’s hard for many alphaoriented investment personalities such as me to swallow but the evidence in favor of index funds is real and consistent stay it ain’t so joe say it ain’t so   sp dow jones – does past performance matter – the persistence scorecard morningstar – performance persistence among mutual funds   preston mcswain is a managing partner and founder of fiduciary wealth partners an sec registered

over two decades of experience norb vonnegut has joined fiduciary wealth partners fwp as a partner “based on my experience writing about wealth management and working as a managing director at a leading advisory firm i know the industry well” said vonnegut “the most important thing i considered when joining a firm was the commitment to putting client interests first and acting as a true fiduciary fiduciary wealth partners’ commitment to these values and to transparency impressed me and i am proud to join them as a partner” vonnegut will focus on helping fwp share its message more broadly educating investors on the advantages of keeping investing simple and on the importance of disclosure of conflicts and transparency “with his years of experience commenting on the industry and watching trends affecting the future direction of wealth management we are thrilled that norb decided to partner with fiduciary wealth partners” said preston mcswain a founding partner of fwp  “he shares our fiduciary standards commitment to providing investors the approach and values behind our trademark transparency simplicity peace of mind ®” in addition to his experience as a financial adviser and columnist mr vonnegut is also a published author and recently completed his first nonfiction work a defensive handbook for investors which probes issues of trust transparency and indexing relative to active money management  he has appeared on bloomberg msnbc and has given a tedx talk about how to avoid financial predators norb is a graduate of harvard college and harvard business school and has spent considerable time serving on nonprofit investment committees to learn more about fiduciary wealth partners please visit our website by clicking here or call us at 000 march   by preston d mcswain our fiduciary commitment to put the best interests of clients first “put the investor first it’s not that complicated” says jack bogle the founder of vanguard and a leading fiduciary advocate bogle made these types of comments again speaking at a recent press conference hosted by the institute for the fiduciary standard during this event which we attended with bogle the institute named fiduciary wealth partners as a member of the founding class of firms that have agreed to conduct themselves according to its “best practices professional conduct standards” here’s why we think it matters to our clients and all investors the institute’s best practices clarify exactly what it means to “put the investor first” and how you can identify whether you’re working with a fiduciary who puts your best interests first at fiduciary wealth partners fwp we are proud to commit to the institute’s best practices for professional conduct we believe these thirdparty standards further define how we can deliver transparency simplicity and peace of mind® to our clients not all fiduciaries are created alike “put the investor first” is a principle it sounds good it’s clearly the right thing to do but it’s subject to interpretation the words might mean one thing to one firm and something completely different to another this is clear not all wealth managers deliberate about what it means to “put the investor first” nor do they routinely scrutinize their own behavior for delivery on the promise in a recent study the cfa institute interviewed more than 00 investment management leaders and surveyed approximately 0 investment professionals researchers found that only  of respondents report staying in the investment industry to help clients another  believe that acting in their clients’ best interests implies taking on career risk the implication is clear you might think you’re dealing with a fiduciary but the cfa’s findings suggest you could be working with an advisor who is not focused on your best interests please click here to read a story that our managing partner preston mcswain wrote on this subject that was published by the cfa institute best practices define what to expect from fiduciaries at fwp we constantly assess what actions are mission critical to putting investor interests first prior to committing to the institute’s best practices we had already pledged the following fiduciary practices to our clients we don’t accept any payments from any investment firm “pay to play” or have any fee sharing arrangements of any type with an outside firm we don’t have arbitration clauses in our agreements all performance is calculated by independent third parties we are not affiliated in any manner with a thirdparty investment firm brokerdealer or custodian no outside firm has any ownership interest in our firm we don’t accept gifts from any thirdparty vendor or provider of any product or service we have given up the securities licenses that would allow us to take commissions from the sale of an investment fund product or security related to this last point as preston mcswain the founder of fiduciary wealth partners says “if we are honest with ourselves it is the lack of opportunity that often keeps us out of trouble”and by not being registered with a brokerdealer fwp can’t accept commissions for the sale of a product or security to our clients b selling incentive fees or participate in “pay to sell” product offering schemes that are quite common on wall street we are proud of our fiduciary standards but we respect the fact that independent third parties sometimes identify specific behaviors that improve what we are already doing and clarify what it means to “put the investor” first with this new set of fiduciary standards fwp has formally updated our sec advisor adv form it serves notice that we will now be governed by and held accountable to the best practices that knut rostad the president of the institute for the fiduciary standard says “demonstrate that advisors deserve clients’ trust with guidance that is distinguished by clarity transparency and honesty in both word and deed” best practices show how you can identify fiduciaries the institute released its list of  best practices on march   and fwp was one of the first advisers in the nation to subscribe hopefully these standards supported by top industry leaders such as jack bogle will create a blueprint that investors can use to evaluate whether wealth managers are putting their interests first to see the full list of fiduciary best practices to which fwp has subscribed to further our commitment to transparency please click on the following link our fiduciary standards if you have any questions about fiduciary best practices or know of anyone who might have doubts about an investment advisor’s commitment to fiduciaries best practices please call us at  000 or email preston mcswain at prestonfwppartners perhaps fiduciary wealth partners can help if not or if we feel that you are currently in good fiduciary hands we’ll tell you more of our views on this subject can also be found by clicking on the following transparency  does the industry protest too much november  0 by preston d mcswain how should you invest now trump wins unexpectedly what are we reminded of from an investment standpoint the chart above that we posted after the brexit vote and will probably publish again someday we’re also reminded that uncertainty is relatively consistent and that consistently emotion leads us to make investment changes in the face of uncertainty at the wrong time before the market opened on the day after the election we had received at least 0 invitations to hear from leading wall street analysts and strategy professionals about what their crystal balls suggest investors should do now more continue to come in and yes the postelectionday stock market down 00 points before the open and rally to finish up approximately 0 points is creating graphs that look just like the emotion chart we are dialing into many of the calls because we want to understand and respect what are sure to be differing opinions what else are we doing striving to avoid making changes why not because we don’t believe we shouldn’t constantly be asking ourselves how we can be better but because being better often means resisting overly tactical moves and sticking to a longterm plan very consistently and again last night the following holds true analysts and strategists are never in doubt but often wrong individual and professional investors make investment changes at the wrong time we have written about this before so we are keeping this relatively short but please click on the following to read more of our thoughts on the points mentioned above what should investors do about xxxx changed the title because we are sure the message will be appropriate sometime again soon – includes the same cycle of emotions chart and links to data in other articles chicken fried  cold beer on a friday night adding a smile here for the day and includes a list of “don’t” bullets for wall street and investors to consider importantly know that we are here and available to lend an ear or answer any questions you may have please call us at 000 or email us personally at prestonfwppartners or jamesfwppartners all the best preston  jamie july  0 by preston d mcswain what should investors do now about brexit – focus on what you can control what should investors do now about brexit the uk vote to leave the eu we continue to suggest that they follow the advice we published the day the brexit vote was announced keep calm and carry on click the link to read our recommendations reflecting back on this week’s events however maybe we should have titled the piece focus on what you can control why first the vast majority of the haloed prognosticators you see on cnbc etc got the brexit vote wrong as i have written about many times in pieces such as groundhog day the accuracy or maybe i should say inaccuracy of wall street estimates consistently reminds me of the saying “never in doubt but often wrong”  to reinforce this point john authers of the financial times wrote the following today “populations across the world have lost faith in the expert guidance of professional economists” click here to read his full piece second you are likely to damage both your mental state and your portfolio if you make investment decisions based on all too common yoyo like financial headlines such as the following from this past week the brexit danger dow sp00 on pace for best week in 0 postbrexit reasons not to chase rallies post brexit they remind me of the titles of the articles below that appeared only two days apart earlier this year “wall street rallies as yellen’s comments suggest that the fed is unlikely to raise rates” “wall street falls as the strength of payroll data suggest that the fed is likely to raise rates” the moral of both those stories should have been remember “projections are based on estimates” yes estimates based on estimates and “assessments have a considerable amount of uncertainty” both are recent direct quotes from janet yellen chair of the federal reserve – for more see should you treat wall street forecasts like april fool’s day jokes so what should you be focused on that is within your control your longterm plan not the models or projections of others i know it’s hard to not get caught up in the emotion of the market but try to remember the old saying “investors create 0year floods every few years” yes it’s ok to smile when you think about the words “investors create” as was the case this week when brexitlike floods happen my firm gets calls asking for our opinion about where the market will go next we don’t have a crystal ball but we are always willing to make this prediction whenever you see large market swings you will see sensational headlines that are designed to catch eyeballs and sell ads but that are often not conducive to good investing wall street which loves volatility not missing out on the opportunity to sell a trade or product when emotions are high investors being sold shortterm ideas that harm longterm returns if and when these predictions come to pass you might be wise to remember the tag line of the drugrelated public service announcement from the 0s “just say no” to help below is a graph that illustrates what all investors feel from time to time professionals included to highlight this cycle this week more than one person called us to ask if they should sell last weekend and monday and tuesday  these calls were followed by calls and emails from some of the same people at the end of this week asking when they should buy  yes as many studies show and the graph above illustrates investors have the tendency to sell low and buy high we aren’t sure what the next few weeks or months will bring but along the lines of the picture above at some point more “alarmed” comments will be published again when this happens try to remember that even though it can seem boring if you resist emotion and stick to your longterm plan the slow and steady tortoise often comes out on top if you kept calm this week you would have been “relieved” to find that the value of your portfolio had likely gone up in addition you would have avoided “frightened” selling for a loss see the below graph of the last five days of price movements of the djia – the red circle represents the panic selling early this week   source wall street journal inline with this week’s focus on the uk as long as you have a welldiversified longterm plan that is designed to meet your goals keep in mind the following ageold investing quote from a well known british writer “my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate… therefore my merchandise makes me not sad”  william shakespeare merchant of venice for more on our thoughts including a more contemporary quote from my year old son following a 00 plus point market drop last year click on the following  it also includes evidence of just how unwise investors’ timing

earned it” warren buffett has unique personal ip that can be summed up in two words experience  respect he has seen it all  the good the bad and the ugly buffett is also a proven investment superstar who has not just talked the talk but has walked the walk  versus a theory or hypothetical model behind his words is a solid track record of success over many market cycles which even other investing outliers look up to and value this is why it’s so powerful when the person whom many consider to be one of the best active investment managers of both public and private equity of all time says the following with respect to how his family trust should be invested “put 0 of the cash in short‐term government bonds and 0 in a very low‐cost sp 00 index fund” because “the trust’s longterm results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors—whether pension funds institutions individuals—who employ high fee managers”  warren buffett    see can i do better for references to instructions buffett has given to the trustee of his family trust people do listen to warren buffett but in spite of his consistent recommendations click here for more of his advice to other superstars such as lebron james and the evidence click here for the facts on historical performance of investment funds much time and investors’ money continue to be spent on the search for shiny new complex and high fee holy grailpromising investment funds maybe the title of my next piece should be why don’t more people follow warren buffett’s advice     see below for one of the best investment ads of all time  now if only the evidence showed that wall street investment analysts’ recommendations were consistently accurate for more read ground hog day   preston mcswain is a managing partner

learn a few things from a country song those of you who know me well know that i am from alabama and that i still have some southern boy in me those of you who know a little country music may also recognize that the title of this post is based on a zac brown band song chicken fried the part of the song that inspired me to write this piece is “well it’s funny how it’s the little things in life that mean the most not where you live the car you drive or the price tag on your clothes there’s no dollar sign on a piece of mind this i’ve come to know” it goes with the following chorus about what really matters most in life “cold beer on a friday night a pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up well i’ve see the sun rise see the love in my woman’s eyes feel the touch of a precious child and know a mother’s love” beyond my fondness for good country music why is a wealth management guy quoting zac brown well if you stay with me on this i promise to tie it all together in the end i probably don’t have to remind many readers that unfortunately the market is off to a rocky start this year understandably some investors are concerned based on my past experience inside big investment firms how are some investment product managers and sales professionals likely feeling giddy as i have written about before wall street likes nothing more than a little fear and is off to the races marketing the latest impressively presented strategies designed to protect investors i am getting multiple emails a day from large investment houses and asset managers selling low volatility funds downside protection trades and absolute return funds the pitches all have implied promises of significant downside protection and some are even being sold based on attractive hypothetical returns yes was smiling when i wrote “hypothetical” the vast majority have little transparency however and you guessed it high fees that drive high profit margins i am not suggesting that all of the presentations are improper what i am saying is that our industry tends to make things too complex and does not give investors enough information about how products are created translation the real ingredients and about how they work especially when you need them the most example many broke down during the last financial crisis to be fair to the industry many of these strategies which are literally created by rocket scientists are based on complex investment and economic theories what is the key word in this sentence theories the products tend to be designed based on models that strive to price how multiple investments which themselves are priced based on multiple factors such as earnings estimates interest rate and currency projections and emotion will perform in various market cycles whew yes that was a mouthful what could possibly go wrong with complex models that rely on key words such as “estimates” “projections” “emotion” “likely” and “multiple factors” among the things that make me pause is that when pressed over “a cold beer on a friday night” my exrocket scientist investment friends from mit admit that their theories can and likely will break down from time to time based on market dislocations that can’t be fully factored into their models getting back to zac my hope is that this is all starting to spark a few questions about what’s really important and what really adds value when i founded my firm almost four years ago i spent a lot time asking questions about what adds the most value to clients during conversations with many wealthy individuals and investment professionals i was routinely reminded of the following comment from a longtime client “preston i hired you to help our family develop and implement an investment plan i am very happy with the management of our investments but do you know what i have come to realize that i really pay you for transparency simplicity and peace of mind” yes some might think i’m a broken record on this but as an adviser to president kennedy is rumored to have told him when he thought he was saying the same things over and over again “when you are at the point that you think you are going to get sick if you say it one more time you have finally reached the point when many people hear it for the first time” some folks seem to be hearing what the evidence consistently says keepitsimple index strategies can perform just as well if not better than complex approaches investors are following the advice of warren buffet and david swenson the chief investment officer of yale and putting record amounts into index funds see links to articles on buffet and swenson at the bottom of this post it seems that our industry still has some listening to do however as it continues to spend an enormous share of its time and money promoting complex products such as multifactor models that are designed to protect against market downturns and defaults if this doesn’t sound familiar go see the movie or read the book the big short to hopefully help the following are a few “don’t” bullets points for wall street to consider don’t make investing a competitive sport each individual is different and can have unique goals winning in investing is reaching client specific goals not beating the other guy who might have different objectives or appetite for risk don’t sell crystal balls or be a sheep as we all know but don’t want to admit wall street predictions are often wrong see our recent groundhog day or talking heads blogs resist the urge to run with the herd and easily sell what has been hot in the past or whatever is being currently promoted as the next great new new thing don’t avoid conversations about the bad or ugly fully disclose the good the bad and the ugly if clients understand the pros and cons of a strategy before implementing it they will be less likely to change course at the wrong time when the going gets rough which it will from time to time don’t forget taxes especially with hedge funds remember that a very large portion of hedge fund returns tend to come back to clients in the form of shortterm capital gains if your client is in the highest tax bracket please adjust your return projections down by approximately 0 before making your pitch don’t underestimate the advantage of liquidity individual clients are not endowments and generally have periodic liquidity needs for large purchases gifts and regular income place a premium on fully liquid investments remember that during the financial crisis many endowments found out the importance of liquidity the hard way when they did not have access to funds that they needed don’t sell anything that you don’t fully understand do we really understand how complex strategies will perform over various market cycles no additional comments really needed as you can sense i am little cynical about how wall street sells the fear of missing out by helping to create what data suggest are relatively unproductive competitions to find and sell alpha rather than taking the easy way out and simply selling relative performance and relative risk metrics let’s spend more time listening to what clients want to achieve and implementing strategies that are designed based on their goals not industry models related to this i am not a big fan of active management but as i recently wrote in what’s in a name if investing in an active strategy or working with a large brand makes a client feel more comfortable and will allow him or her to stick to a plan more easily then regardless of the relative performance versus an index these might be the correct choices at fiduciary wealth partners we believe that by focusing on transparency and simplicity our clients will benefit by being more comfortable with their investments which in turn will increase the likelihood that they’ll stick to longterm plans during good times and bad what many studies show is the key to longterm investing success hopefully this will also increase peace of mind and allow all to enjoy a little more “cold beer on a friday night a pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up well i’ve see the run rise see the love in my woman’s eyes feel the touch of a precious child and know a mother’s love”     both warren buffett and david swenson have repeatedly discussed the evidence in favor of index funds and consistently recommended index investing to individual investors  see the following links for more information warren buffett to his heirs put my estate in index funds warren buffett’s advice to lebron james index

following twitter linked in aboutme personal blog   february  0 by preston d mcswain don’t let your portfolio get sacked are you ready for the big game super bowl 0 the seasoned star peyton manning in what could be his final game versus the new star cam newton the only improvement from my new england perspective would be watching our patriots this sunday but i am sure i will enjoy the excitment on the field and off with the tv commercials and halftime show beyond the entertainment of the super bowl the nfl runs a business that generates exceptional returns if marketing is your game you could do a lot worse than to follow the lead of the nfl in investing we can also learn a lot from some nfl stars how not to invest star players run up impressive records on the field but many stories exist of even combined heisman trophy college national champion and super bowl stars like tony dorsett failing in finance cam if you win sunday read here and don’t let this be you some might think spending is the problem and in some cases you would be correct more often than not however professional athletes make the same mistakes as many other investors a good article on this was published in forbes titled how to lose 0 million in the piece a top sports agent made the following quote “what really gets these guys are not the cars jewelry or even houses it is the big three – divorce poor tax planning and bad investments” i won’t make any comments on family issues and i am not an accountant but i will make a few quick comments on investing in our last post groundhog day i talked about the halo effect which is a documented psychological bias we have to place confidence in people who are better known and deemed to be more intelligent better looking or more respected what marketing machine knows this well wall street evidence consistenly shows that low cost boring simple investments such as index funds often outperform more complex strategies but our defenses are constantly rushed with cnbc spots presented by professionals with halos in the morning someone might say “buy” but in the afternoon someone might say “sell” it is no wonder studies show that the average investor significantly underperforms the market due to emotional selling or buying at the wrong time according to research from morningstar the 0year return of the average balanced fund mix of stocks and bonds for the period ending  was almost  what was the average return of investors in balanced funds over this same time period approximately  which represents a gap of  on average per year for 0 years the gap for investors in sector funds which tend to attract more active traders was even higher at over  on average per year for 0 years click here for the full report and see the below chart so why so much focus on new investing plays just as exciting calls on the field drive sales of tv ads and profits for the nfl transactions and new products quarterbacked by haloed investment managers drive wall street profits i am not a fan of market predictions but i did recently go on the record with the following if you see the market continue to have a difficult time you will see more sensational headlines that are designed to sell ads but not conducive to good investing wall street which loves volatility not missing out on the opportunity to sell a trade or a product when anxiety is high sales pitches for expensive downside protection products and hedging strategies as i wrote about in your brain on the market if an investment coach is constantly recommending new schemes especially during volatile times “just say no” next as your own best general manager consider firing the coach to help you defend again aggressive offensive moves consider the following quote “preston what you need to understand is that i get paid to publish ideas that we can sell for a profit if i don’t the transactional brokers and management complain i then lose my job i learned a long time ago that it pays to feed the street” i heard this one night over dinner from the global chief investment officer of a large international wealth management firm i got to know this person well over the years and even though it was his job to help pitch active investment strategies ironically he often said his belief in investing skill was very low what did he quietly admit was often the best choice for investors index funds crazy you might say top investors don’t invest passively they are active stars who have access to the best talent and top mba draft picks with their years of training and resources surely they believe they can consistently post record stats well it has been my experience that many in the industry especially off the record after an adult beverage consistently say the following no what have a few investing superstars said on the record first consider david swenson chief investment officer of yale’s endowment yale and other ivy league schools might not produce as many nfl stars as my favorite sec schools but they do have some of the top endowment returns in the nation and yale consistently leads the division what does swenson say in his book on personal investing “a serious fiduciary with responsibility for taxable assets recognizes that only extraordinary circumstances justify deviation from a simple strategy…” you can read more on this in a piece that i wrote titled what would yale do if it was taxable yes as swenson and the nfl agent mention don’t forget to factor in taxes second how about warren buffett recently he gave the following advice on cnbc to the nba star lebron james “everybody’s got an idea… but usually simplest is the best” buffett went on to say that athletes are often approached with investment ideas but that lebron should “just make monthly investments in a lowcost index fund” click here to read the full story as an fyi he also wrote in a 0 berkshire annual letter to shareholders that the trustee of his estate should do the following for the benefit of his heirs “put 0 of the cash in shortterm government bonds and 0 in a very lowcost sp 00 index fund i suggest vanguard’s i believe the trust’s longterm results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors — whether pension funds institutions or individuals…” so before rushing onto the investing field consider taking a timeout don’t get by getting caught up in super bowl type investing hype and don’t make investing a competition is winning really defined by outperforming the other guy or is it about reaching goals on behalf of your family to avoid getting sacked by wall street’s marketing blitzes stick to your longterm game plan and consider following the advice of investing superstars such as buffet and swenson as they have said the evidence is clear on how to consistenly produce goal winning investment scores keep it simple and consider more index funds   preston mcswain is a managing partner and founder of fiduciary

on social media please visit the following twitter linked in aboutme personal blog february  0 by preston d mcswain groundhog day crowds gather early in the morning to watch for what the future will bring the media is on hand for the latest predictions and they run stories with sensational headlines to engage their audience men in coat and tie confer hoist prominent prognosticators on high and loudly sing praises about their ability to predict the future beyond the punxsutawney phil ceremony illustrated in the picture above what was i just describing on this groundhog day wall street and the endless daily stream of chatter about morning futures and estimates about the direction of the financial markets unfortunately research suggests that the wizards of wall street often have about as much predictive power as the wizard of oz and as much success in predicting the future as groundhogs just as it is might be hard to resist clicking on stories about punxsutawney phil and his predictions of spring it is hard to not get caught up in the emotion and allure of economic and market predictions as patrick o’shaughnessy recently wrote in his blog the investor’s field guide “our brains evolved to recognize patterns which creates the side effect that we are pattern junkies” as he writes “this patternaddiction makes us obsessed with the future” which is only “enhanced by the psychological bias known as the halo effect the better known more intelligent better looking or more respected an expert forecaster is the greater the confidence we have in their predictions” as i have written about before even federal reserve governors and their economists are poor soothsayers see the bottom of this article for related posts and research below is a quote from a report published in february of 0 by the federal reserve bank of san francisco based on a study of the federal reserve open market committee’s summary of economic projections sep “over the past seven years many growth forecasts including the sep’s… have been too optimistic in particular the sep forecast  did not anticipate the great recession that started in december 00  underestimated the severity of the downturn once it began and  consistently overpredicted the speed of the recovery that started in june 00” some might say “well this not unexpected the best minds are not in the public sector but in the private sector inside the best investment banks” my halo bias wants to believe this but independent analysis of investment analysts’ estimates and projections paints a consistent picture  they are also often wrong at the wrong time as an example mckinsey  company produced a study in 00 about the accuracy of earnings estimates which was then updated in 00  the following quote summarizes their findings “analysts we found were typically overoptimistic slow to revise their forecasts to reflect new economic conditions and prone to making increasingly inaccurate forecasts when economic growth declined  on average analysts’ forecasts have been almost 00 percent too high” the chart below is from the most recent 00 mckinsey  co research paper the light green line represents wall street earnings forecasts the blue line reflects what actually happened like bill murray could not believe during his groundhog day experience surely we learned something during the last financial crisis and are not repeating things over and over the same way well just as recent experience has shown that political predictions are difficult research on the accuracy of investment estimates continues to disappoint cxo advisory recently published a report based on over 00 predictions made by  investment gurus covering the time period  –  what did they find the accuracy of wellknown investment strategy professionals to include jeremy grantham and abby joseph cohen was only 4 or worse than a coin toss see the following for the complete study – guru grades evidence suggests that market predictions aren’t worth much but this doesn’t mean you should go into an investment hole during difficult wintry market conditions if you have spent time developing a longterm plan that is based on your goals and not the models of others stay on course or as we wrote about before just keep a steady hand on the tiller so if you see rough market shadows that make you feel like a groundhog remember history shows that market troubles eventually thaw and that steady longterm investors are consistently rewarded and hey if you want confirmation that i am correct just read the stories out today about punxsutawney phil he did not see his shadow so the good times of spring are definitely just a few weeks away   more of preston’s posts and research related to this article can be found at the

clients professional colleagues and the community to see more of his posts and follow him on social media please visit the following twitter linked in aboutme personal blog january  0 by preston d mcswain talking heads the picture in this post is from an album cover that was reportedly prepared for the band the talking heads the theme of the blog is based on their album speaking in tongues and its hit single burning down the house for an 0s throw back moment consider clicking on the previous link earlier this month the following headline came in on my email “delusional fed could trigger  emerging market equity correction” i will avoid pointing out the well known investment professional who is reported to have made this quote but as i just wrote in my last blog titled your brain on the market headlines like this from wall street talking heads don’t help investors make constructive decisions  often they only create unneeded emotion and fuel irrational behavior that harms longterm returns as we have written about many times before at the very least prognostications like this tend to be inaccurate consider clicking on the following if we had a chief economist we would have to pay them at worst they are self serving how when i was a managing director at a large asset management firm i sat in on media training with our senior portfolio managers  what was the most important message pms were told to reinforce in interviews “while in front of the camera be sure to use the opportunity to talk up positions that you just bought to get the herd interested in buying them” potentially along the lines of today’s “delusional” comment pms were also told to talk down positions that they did not hold which were part of their index or were large holdings of their competitors  i actually witnessed portfolio management teams watch cnbc interviews and then cheer as they saw large numbers of buy or sell trades come across the ticker based on their colleague’s comments related to this consider the following two true stories from our don’t be a sheep article  – the “honest” global chief investment officer once i was having dinner with the global chief investment officer of the firm for which i worked at the time i was asking him why his monthly commentary and the first few sections of his team’s glossy monthly wealth management publication were becoming more and more shortterm trade consider the advantages of shorting currencies etc and active manager oriented especially based on the fact that he spoke often about how he had most of his personal money index funds  after a little wine he admitted that most of the pieces would likely not add any value and that some such as hedging recommendations and currency calls were quite risky  he then said “preston what you need to understand is that i get paid to publish ideas that we can sell for a profit  if i don’t the transactional brokers and management complain  i then lose my job  i learned a long time ago that it pays to feed the street”  – the “honest” ceo and global head of alternative asset management in the process of trying to get good insight into a competitor’s hedge fund portfolio for a prospect presentation i went to the ceo of my thencompany previously he had been the global head of alternative asset management for the firm that had created the hedge fund portfolio i was analyzing perfect i thought he led the group that created all of the products  after i gave him a brief overview he smiled and said “preston you’re thinking too much  you are correct the performance of the portfolios has been bad  we had a great brand though an even better ivy league mba sales team and we knew it  so we looked at products one way if we could sell them they were good” i could go on and on about this but reaching back again to our last post don’t let your brain get flamed up by stock market commentators or marketing presentations  remember market flames fueled by sensational quotes and headlines can burn down your investment portfolio   preston d mcswain is a managing partner and founder of fiduciary wealth partners an sec registered investment advisor committed to forming
