private pooled investment vehicles the funds currently have four active investment strategies the touradji global resources investment strategy seeks to maximize compounded annual total returns and minimize the volatility of returns through a portfolio of investments across the global equity and commodity markets with smaller and shorterterm trades that revolve around relativevalue opportunities the strategy seeks to achieve portfolio returns which are noncorrelated with equities fixed income commodity or hedge fund indicesthe touradji diversified investment strategy is similar to the global resource strategy sometimes trading pari passu on commodity trades however over time it is touradji’s expectation that the strategy will diversify its portfolio relative to that of the global resources strategythe touradji index i plus investment strategy primarily trades in commodity futures with an objective of outperforming a commodity benchmark while maintaining reasonable volatility and leveragethe touradji merger arbitrage investment strategy seeks to produce consistent returns on a riskadjusted basis that offer low correlation to traditional equity and fixed income portfolios by simultaneously buying and selling stock of companies of announced mergers or leveraged lbos the strategy evaluates the risk of a merger or lbo closing not closing on time or not closing at all this uncertainty creates the arbitrage opportunity by bringing a discount to the target company’s equity price versus the price that the combined company would have when the deal closes of the major sources of risk deal collapse is the greatest but can be mitigated through diversification and hedging with options political donations k  democratic senatorial campaign committee the democratic
