or  per share inclusive of  or  per share due to a reduced tax expense in accordance with newly adopted accounting guidance on stock option exercises compared to net income of  or  per share in the same quarter last year our revenue miles declined by  or  to  versus the same quarter last year  total revenues for the quarter were  down  from the same quarter last year  transportation revenues excluding fuel surcharges were  down   our transportation revenue per mile increased by  over the same quarter last year  fuel surcharge revenues were up  to  due to higher diesel prices and the positive benefits of renegotiating fuel surcharge tables with several key customers last year our lower revenues in the quarter resulted from a net reduction of business levels across our existing customer base mainly stemming from rates in competitive bid processes and the move of a particular customer to a privately owned fleet  additionally the lower driver count and difficulty hiring are hindering us from adding back potential new business in certain markets where business is available we managed to keep our overall variable costs inline with the declines in miles and revenues  compensation and benefits decreased  due to fewer miles driven but was negatively impacted by a onetime accrual of  resulting from the award of two additional vacation days for our drivers  net fuel expense ie gross fuel expenses less fuel surcharges decreased by  due to fewer miles driven and higher fuel surcharges   insurance and losses were down by  versus the same quarter last year due mainly to favorable adjustments to risk partially offset by higher health claims  sga was flat as we remain staffed to grow our revenues and driver count as a result operating profit this quarter was down  to  negatively impacted by the onetime  vacation accrual compared to  in the same quarter last year  operating ratio was  this quarter versus  in the same quarter last year first nine months results for fiscal year  the company reported net income of  or  per share inclusive of  or  per share due to a reduced tax expense in accordance with newly adopted accounting guidance on stock option exercises compared to net income of  or  per share in the same period last year  the prior year included  or  per share of net income from the settlement of a claim with bp in connection with the  deepwater horizon event our revenue miles declined by  or  to  versus the same period last year due to an overall net loss of business due to i rates ii privatization of a customer fleet and iii the lower demand for gasoline in the earlier part of the fiscal year which was not fully offset by the addition of new business with other customers  total revenues were  down  from last year  transportation revenues excluding fuel surcharges were down  to  as a result of the lower revenue miles  however our transportation revenue per mile increased by  over the same period last year  fuel surcharge revenues were up  to  due to higher diesel prices and the positive benefits of renegotiating fuel surcharge tables with several key customers last year our variable costs were inline with the decrease in miles and revenues  compensation and benefits decreased  due to fewer miles driven  net fuel expense ie gross fuel expenses less fuel surcharges decreased by  due to fewer miles driven and higher fuel surcharges insurance and losses were up  versus the same period last year due mainly to increased health claims  depreciation increased  but was mostly offset by lower repair and equipment leasing costs as we have continued to replace leased equipment from a prior acquisition with new equipment  sga was flat as we remain staffed to grow our revenues and driver count  corporate expense was  lower than last year mainly due to a  reduction in legal fees  as a result operating profit was down  to  compared to  last year  operating ratio was  versus  last year summary and outlook the full impacts of the lost business from some large customer bids were substantially realized this quarter and in the first nine months of this fiscal year  additionally following a recent merger another large customer took significant steps to move some of its carrier requirements into the merged entitys private fleet resulting in lost business for us in certain markets  it typically takes some time to fully replace business losses of this nature we have added several significant pieces of business throughout the fiscal year but not nearly enough to offset the losses we have seen volumes picking up during the seasonally busier summer months and a return to more normalized gasoline demand during the rd quarter  we continued to see improvement in our per mile transportation revenue as well as our net fuel expense following the implementation of more neutral fuel surcharge tables last year  the driver hiring market remains very tight  during the quarter we experienced a reduction of our average driver force down to  versus  in the prior year quarter a  decline  we took several steps during this quarter to drive future growth in our driver count  in june we announced a driver pay increase effective june   increasing base pay by  and awarding  additional vacation days  we have also begun targeting owner operators in our marketing efforts  in the month of june we saw a significant improvement in our driver turnover rate which improved thirteen percentage points versus the average over the past four months  additionally our average number of drivers in training increased by  this quarter versus the prior quarter and  versus the same quarter last year  we are focused on maintaining these trends as we work to grow our driver count and revenues we are currently very focused on improving our technology  management believes that investing in our technology gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from our competition both with our employees and our customers  during this calendar year we are planning to upgrade our entire network infrastructure to provide more speed and reliability to the field and our customers  we are also implementing several new software upgrades which we believe will enhance the employee experience improve customer satisfaction and ultimately allow us to reduce expenses and improve our bottom line results  during the quarter we terminated the pensacola fl sales contract entered into last quarter and immediately went under contract with a new buyer at the same m sales price  the contract is subject to numerous contingencies  we made significant progress on the sale of our tampa terminal facility m sales price and are in the process of granting an extension to allow the developer the time it needs to get all plans and approvals finalized with the city of tampa  we operate in many of the best markets in the country and are known in those markets and beyond as a top rated carrier in both safety and customer satisfaction  we are committed to continuing our focus on safety driver retention and customer satisfaction and are confident that execution of that focus will enable us to improve our profitability  we will benefit from and plan to maintain a strong balance sheet as we work to achieve our targeted operating ratio in the low nineties and double digit returns on after tax capital employed
