actions – purchase – sale  – number of transactions  january   am   comments share bigfoot project investments inc is about to add some mystery to the us stock market by becoming a publicly traded company after years of smalltime operations the company owned by carmine biscardi will follow in the footsteps of twitter inc nyse twtr by filing an ipo under the  jumpstart our business startups act the law allows emerging growth firms with less than  billion in annual revenue to host an initial public offering bigfoot project more than qualifies with just  worth of sales and assets mostly garnered by making movies selling dvds big money for bigfoot in its filing with the sec bigfoot project said it hopes to raise  million which the business will used to expand its movie making business and to “capture the creature known as bigfoot” several other bigfoot themed businesses have been able to raise substantial amounts of money from supporters of the search but the bigfoot project will be the first to aim for such a large sum bigfoot or big flop the venture is unlikely to garner much cash though many bigfoot enthusiasts say the biscardi’s company makes a mockery of what they consider to be a serious pursuit related link brands of pot emerge as the industry grows in the past biscardi has been chastised by his peers after his sightings didn’t pan out with some calling his company a mere publicity stunt investors who don’t believe bigfoot exists are also expected to shy away as without the possibility of the creature’s capture on the table the company is generating most of its revenue from dvd sales still some diehard believers in the elusive sasquatch may be willing to cough up the cash in hopes that biscardi will finally capture bigfoot postedin  jumpstart our

recurring or guaranteed source of revenues and cannot predict when if ever we will become profitable there is significant uncertainty projecting future profitability due to our minimal operating

negative cash flows from operations pending receipt of listings or some form of advertising revenues we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through additional common stock offerings to the extent available or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital we anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next twelve months our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such risks for us include but are not limited to an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth to address these risks we must among other things obtain a customer base implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy continually develop and upgrade our website provide national and regional industry participants with an effective efficient and accessible website on which to promote their products and services through the

cash flow from operations will not meet our present and nearterm cash needs and thus we will require additional cash resources including the sale of equity or debt securities to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next  months we will require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions implementation of our strategy to expand our sales and marketing initiatives increase brand awareness or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our own financial resources and then current cashflows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities the sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects  offbalance sheet arrangements we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are
