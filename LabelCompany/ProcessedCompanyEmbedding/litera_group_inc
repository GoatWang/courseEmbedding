fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of  or more litera group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on june   we were formed for the purpose of providing products and services within the film and theater production industry our founder mr wade gardner was appointed ceo president secretary cfo treasurer and director of the company the board voted to seek capital to carry out our business plan we received our initial funding of  through the sale of common stock to mr gardner who purchased  shares of our common stock on june   our principal executive offices are located at  buckingham pkwy culver city ca  our telephone number is   and our fax number is   litera is a developmental stage corporation that is dedicated to the creation and commercialization of literary and dramatic products and services with the aim of achieving profitability and sustaining growth of our business our implemented plan of operation is the development of screenplays stage plays comedy sketch and skit scripts short film scripts and other literary and dramatic works as well as offer abridgment and adaptation services within the theater and film production community the key to our success lies in the companys ability to identify a niche in the entertainment production market and fill the unsatisfied demand litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for fresh entertainment material to produce and distribute to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others this is the market niche that litera has focused on since our inception we have commenced our business operations including developing products preliminary marketing of the completed work as well as closing the first sixteen sales of our projects for an aggregate of  the company also has seven more finished products available for sale as well as four more projects in advanced development status we negotiate contract details for our products and services as an option or an outright sale basis currently the company secured all the resources and skills needed to create and market our products and services internally by utilizing our sole officer and directors creative writing abilities and his background within the film and theater entertainment in the future litera may pursue additional avenues outside its own walls and look to outsource certain aspects of services and product development and engage playwrightsscreenwriters for this purpose we anticipate that as the company grows over the next sixteen months pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the film and theater production industry and by the use of creative and marketing consultants which will allow litera to expand its management team and add to the board of directors our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities and the production and sale of our initial projects as follows  incorporation of the company  initial funding from our founder  carrying out of our business plan  initial procurement of prospective clientele for our products and services  product development and securing our first sixteen sales table of contents as an emerging company we continually analyze our business plan and operations in the light of current trends within the theater and film entertainment market conditions and developments we intend to become a selfsustained operational entity in order to generate revenues the management will aim to maximize the companys business value by creating competitive products and services addressing market and competition utilizing specific marketing strategies and establishing growth strategy for our company our principal products and services the company develops literary and dramatic works such as screenplays stage plays comedy sketch and skit scripts short film scripts etc for theaterfilm production on our clients request we will also provide abridgment and adaptation services on any products they are interested in abridgment is a condensing of a creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the original adaptation is conversion of an original work to another genre or medium eg a short film script into a stage play etc the process for creating a literary or dramatic work can be an arduous one for each project we conduct a needs assessment to determine the trends in certain categories of theater and film entertainment that enjoy popularity at the time the theater and cinema culture is cyclical in nature every once in a while a certain vision topic or genre becomes popular and producers release films and performances that adhere to this style or genre until the current interest and demand fizzle down other genres then take over and the process runs full cycle again for purposes of demand and marketability choosing a trendgenre that is currently on the edge of popularity is vital and this is why a proper needs assessment is essential we consider it the most important aspect of the entire process next we determine the feasibility of making our product a success we consider our product a success when it garnishes interest from prospective buyers and results in a sale or option contract during our feasibility analysis we explore and analyze similar films and performances in a chosen category that were proven successful over time to identify the creative and commercial attributes that made them work in order to utilize them for our projects we then identify the audience who we intend to reach through our product knowing the audience is important because it determines the content that will appear in the writing as it may vary greatly depending on the intended audience targeting the product at specific audience increases the chances of the product sparking interest from potential buyers so we must determine the market we intend our product for and cater to this audiences expectations throughout our writing further we move to concept development we identify an idea or a story within a genre that is popular or gaining in popularity based on our needs assessment analysis this is considered a products early development where a story outline is created once the story outline takes shape writing or actual creative development begins it is the most timeconsuming part of the process during which a workable script is crafted from a story outline this crucial phase includes developing the format narrative plot characters story lines and dialogue introducing conflict climax and resolution writing out scenebyscene physical interaction utilizing symbolism etc the drafts are then rewritten and polished numerous times until we believe they are ready to be marketed for sale at which time a logline and synopsis to convey both the content and the tone of the completed work are prepared for prospective clients review and consideration litera makes sure to prepare these carefully thought out and compelling to engage and excite a prospective client about the potential of the project all phases of our product development marketing and sales are conducted exclusively by mr gardner who devotes full time to the companys operations todate no capital has been expensed for development of our works litera develops products on spec ie noncommissioned and advertises them directly to our target market mr gardner uses his numerous industry contacts and studio introductions that he has developed over course of his career in entertainment business as the starting point in our clientele building depending on the complexity of the project it takes mr gardner about  weeks to produce a product ready for marketing table of contents target market and our niche within it is essential for the companys success to identify a niche in the entertainment market and fill the unsatisfied demand to select a niche in the entertainment market that litera could cater to the company researched core groups of professionals within the large demographic entertainment community who have similar needs and interests that could be targeted with excellent results all the research data was derived from available industry and marketing information accumulated by our sole officer and director and required no expenses we were able to establish that having weathered financial storms in the past decade the dynamics within the entertainment industry encountered changes which resulted in an acute shortage of development capital for new projects both in film and theater while major studios and production companies maintain control of the highend of the market and the big movies and shows the independent film and theatrical producers have proven themselves to be more efficient making low budget films and theater shows to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for new exciting projects to produce and distribute this is the market niche that litera has selected and will focus on competition our competitive strategy and methods of competition the film and theater production industry is highly competitive and our company faces competition ranging from large and well established film and theater production companies to thousands of small firms engaged in developing and producing play and screenplay options and other material in a similar manner as litera and seeking to enter the industry our competitive strategy is based on the facts that while litera is at a significant disadvantage to more established competitors due to our lack of financial resources scarcity of relationships within the film and theater production community and absence of major marketing tools the barriers to entry into the industry are nevertheless relatively low it takes skills knowledge and contacts to develop and sell products and services similar to ours the company believes that mr gardners preexisting industry connections his experience and background may allow us to tap into the theater and film production industry with a certain level of credibility we will aim to produce creatively unique projects to gain the competitive edge we need while watching closely for emerging trends in theater and cinema and demands of the audience the companys primary method of competition is to market specifically to independent and experimental film makers and small theater production companies to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work and therefore they rely on others to supply them with wellwritten material we believe that since we have chosen this specific niche market we will be able to target the right audience and cater to its demands marketing marketing objectives and strategies litera markets its products and services directly to the theater and film production community focusing specifically on independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios our marketing objectives are as follows � establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market � creating and maintaining a media list of theater and film entertainment pr agencies and advertising firms contacts � building a network of theater and film industry professional relationships and referrals table of contents to promote and market our products and services we may incorporate the following strategies � establishing online presence by designing a corporate website reflecting products and scope of services offered we will also engage in a search engine optimization campaign to improve visibility of our website and assist us with awareness for our products and services optimizing a website may involve editing its content and html and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines � approaching our industry target market by email the most basic method of contacting is a carefully thought out query letter sent via email which consists of a oneparagraph synopsis of a project a bio a logline in standard business format focusing specifically on our selected target market community who have similar needs and interests may yield excellent results � engaging a pr campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business � participating in writers conferences and pitch fests as well as submitting completed scripts for selection to film and theater festivals while winning a contest is obviously a good way to add value to the product even entering in such competitions will result in getting exposure for our company and in some cases in reviews currently mr gardner promotes our products through many channels including networking at local film and theater festivals and internet sources as well as expanding his personal professional relationships with small and experimental studios and independent producers while mr gardner has limited experience in developing and expanding a client base and marketing products to them we anticipate that as the company grows over the next sixteen months pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the theater and film production industry and by the use of technical and marketing consultants which will allow qualified individuals to join mr gardner on our management team and board of directors currently litera does not have any existing relationships with pr agents publicists producers or producers agents research and development the company has not expended funds for research and development costs since inception other than utilizing mr gardners experiences and available industry and marketing information litera has not undertaken any research and development activities regarding our target market and marketability of our products theatrical and film production industry the major business centers of film and theatrical production are concentrated in the united states europe india and china the theatrical and film production industry consists of the technological and commercial institutions that are involved in creation of a film or stage performance such as production companies studios cinematography choreography production screenplaywriting preproduction post production film and theater festivals actors dancers singers film and theatrical producers directors and other personnel due to the great expense required to produce a movie or a stage play the making of a film or a performance usually has to be done in conjunction with an already established production company however the production of independent films and small scale stage performances has begun to evolve with the advent of more affordable equipment and more sophisticated consumer technology as well as the increasing visibility of independent festivals such as sundance film festival or contemporary american theater festival independent projects are often described as less commerciallydriven art forms which differ significantly from the norms of plotdriven mainstream classical hollywood cinema or broadway theater catering specifically to the needs of independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios is the focus of the companys business table of contents our significant employee we currently have one employee mr gardner who is our founder and serves as our sole officer and director mr gardner currently devotes full time to our business and is responsible for our daily operations including product development sales and marketing fund raising implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of mr gardner this individual would be difficult or impossible to replace the loss of this key contributor or his failure to perform could materially and adversely affect our

in these estimates could occur in the future changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require us to apply significant judgment in their application

concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plan is to obtain such resources for the company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   basis of presentation   the companys financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the companys fiscal year

reasonably assured   if any of the above conditions are not met the company will defer revenue until all conditions are met   income taxes   the company provides for income taxes using an asset and liability approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized   per share data   in accordance with asc  earnings per share the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive at september   the company had no stock equivalents that were antidilutive and excluded in the loss per share computation   fair value of financial instruments   fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments as these estimates are subjective in nature involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment they cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the shortterm nature of these instruments management is of the opinion that the company is not exposed to significant market or credit risks arising from these financial instruments      table of contents   litera group inc notes to the  condensed financial statements september     note   summary of significant accounting principles continued

companys common stock for common share issuances   long lived assets   the company follows the provisions of asc  for its longlived assets the companys longlived assets which include rightsownership of undeveloped film scripts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable   the company assesses the recoverability of its longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related longlived asset or group of longlived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets fair value is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable if longlived assets are determined to be recoverable but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated the net book values of the longlived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives   recent accounting pronouncements   the

reporting   litera group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on june   we were formed for the purpose of providing products and services within the film and theater production industry our founder mr wade gardner was appointed ceo president secretary cfo treasurer and director of the company the board voted to seek capital to carry out our business plan we received our initial funding of  through the sale of common stock to mr gardner who purchased  shares of our common stock on june   our principal executive offices are located at  buckingham pkwy culver city ca  our telephone number is   and our fax number is     litera is a developmental stage corporation that is dedicated to the creation and commercialization of literary and dramatic products and services with the aim of achieving profitability and sustaining growth of our business our implemented plan of operation is the development of screenplays stage plays comedy sketch and skit scripts short film scripts and other literary and dramatic works as well as offer abridgment and adaptation services within the theater and film production community   the key to our success lies in the company’s ability to identify a niche in the entertainment production market and fill the unsatisfied demand litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for fresh entertainment material to produce and distribute to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others this is the market niche that litera has focused on   since our inception we have commenced our business operations including developing products preliminary marketing of the completed work as well as closing the first nineteen sales of our projects for an aggregate of  the company also has two more finished products available for sale as well as one more project in advanced development status we negotiate contract details for our products and services as an option or an outright sale basis currently the company secured all the resources and skills needed to create and market our products and services internally by utilizing our sole officer and director’s creative writing abilities and his background within the film and theater entertainment in the future litera may pursue additional avenues outside its own walls and look to outsource certain aspects of services and product development and engage playwrightsscreenwriters for this purpose we anticipate that as the company grows over the next twelve months pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the film and theater production industry and by the use of creative and marketing consultants which will allow litera to expand its management team and add to the board of directors   our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities and the production and sale of our initial projects as follows      incorporation of the company          initial funding from our founder          carrying out of our business plan          initial procurement of prospective clientele for our products and services          product development and securing our first sales      table of contents   as an emerging company we continually analyze our business plan and operations in the light of current trends within the theater and film entertainment market conditions and developments we intend to become a selfsustained operational entity in order to generate revenues the management will aim to maximize the company’s business value by creating competitive products and services addressing market and competition utilizing specific marketing strategies and establishing growth strategy for our company   our principal products and services   the company develops literary and dramatic works such as screenplays stage plays comedy sketch and skit scripts short film scripts etc for theaterfilm production on our clients request we will also provide abridgment and adaptation services on any products they are interested in abridgment is a condensing of a creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the original adaptation is conversion of an original work to another genre or medium eg a short film script into a stage play etc   the process for creating a literary or dramatic work can be an arduous one for each project we conduct a needs assessment to determine the trends in certain categories of theater and film entertainment that enjoy popularity at the time the theater and cinema culture is cyclical in nature every once in a while a certain vision topic or genre becomes popular and producers release films and performances that adhere to this style or genre until the current interest and demand fizzle down other genres then take over and the process runs full cycle again for purposes of demand and marketability choosing a trendgenre that is currently on the edge of popularity is vital and this is why a proper needs assessment is essential we consider it the most important aspect of the entire process   next we determine the feasibility of making our product a success we consider our product a success when it garnishes interest from prospective buyers and results in a sale or option contract during our feasibility analysis we explore and analyze similar films and performances in a chosen category that were proven successful over time to identify the creative and commercial attributes that made them work in order to utilize them for our projects   we then identify the audience who we intend to reach through our product knowing the audience is important because it determines the content that will appear in the writing as it may vary greatly depending on the intended audience targeting the product at specific audience increases the chances of the product sparking interest from potential buyers so we must determine the market we intend our product for and cater to this audience’s expectations throughout our writing   further we move to concept development we identify an idea or a story within a genre that is popular or gaining in popularity based on our needs assessment analysis this is considered a product’s early development where a story outline is created once the story outline takes shape writing or actual creative development begins it is the most timeconsuming part of the process during which a workable script is crafted from a story outline this crucial phase includes developing the format narrative plot characters story lines and dialogue introducing conflict climax and resolution writing out scenebyscene physical interaction utilizing symbolism etc the drafts are then rewritten and polished numerous times until we believe they are ready to be marketed for sale at which time a logline and synopsis to convey both the content and the tone of the completed work are prepared for prospective clients review and consideration litera makes sure to prepare these carefully thought out and compelling to engage and excite a prospective client about the potential of the project   all phases of our product development marketing and sales are conducted exclusively by mr gardner who devotes full time to the company’s operations todate no capital has been expensed for development of our works litera develops products on spec ie noncommissioned and advertises them directly to our target market mr gardner uses his numerous industry contacts and studio introductions that he has developed over course of his career in entertainment business as the starting point in our clientele building depending on the complexity of the project it takes mr gardner about  weeks to produce a product ready for marketing   target market and our niche within   it is essential for the company’s success to identify a niche in the entertainment market and fill the unsatisfied demand to select a niche in the entertainment market that litera could cater to the company researched core groups of professionals within the large demographic entertainment community who have similar needs and interests that could be targeted with excellent results all the research data was derived from available industry and marketing information accumulated by our sole officer and director and required no expenses we were able to establish that having weathered financial storms in the past decade the dynamics within the entertainment industry encountered changes which resulted in an acute shortage of development capital for new projects both in film and theater while major studios and production companies maintain control of the highend of the market and the big movies and shows the independent film and theatrical producers have proven themselves to be more efficient making low budget films and theater shows to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work but instead procure completed aspiring projects to produce or distribute from others litera will target independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios that constantly scout for new exciting projects to produce and distribute this is the market niche that litera has selected and will focus on      table of contents   competition our competitive strategy and methods of competition   the film and theater production industry is highly competitive and our company faces competition ranging from large and well established film and theater production companies to thousands of small firms engaged in developing and producing play and screenplay options and other material in a similar manner as litera and seeking to enter the industry   our competitive strategy is based on the facts that while litera is at a significant disadvantage to more established competitors due to our lack of financial resources scarcity of relationships within the film and theater production community and absence of major marketing tools the barriers to entry into the industry are nevertheless relatively low it takes skills knowledge and contacts to develop and sell products and services similar to ours the company believes that mr gardners preexisting industry connections his experience and background may allow us to tap into the theater and film production industry with a certain level of credibility we will aim to produce creatively unique projects to gain the competitive edge we need while watching closely for emerging trends in theater and cinema and demands of the audience   the company’s primary method of competition is to market specifically to independent and experimental film makers and small theater production companies to save time and money indie producers and small studios do not outlay expenses associated with creation of a literary or dramatic work and therefore they rely on others to supply them with wellwritten material we believe that since we have chosen this specific niche market we will be able to target the right audience and cater to its demands   marketing marketing objectives and strategies   litera markets its products and services directly to the theater and film production community focusing specifically on independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios   our marketing objectives are as follows   · establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market     · creating and maintaining a media list of theater and film entertainment pr agencies and advertising firms contacts     · building a network of theater and film industry professional relationships and referrals   to promote and market our products and services we may incorporate the following strategies   · establishing online presence by designing a corporate website reflecting products and scope of services offered we will also engage in a search engine optimization campaign to improve visibility of our website and assist us with awareness for our products and services optimizing a website may involve editing its content and html and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines     · approaching our industry target market by email the most basic method of contacting is a carefully thought out query letter sent via email which consists of a oneparagraph synopsis of a project a bio a logline in standard business format focusing specifically on our selected target market community who have similar needs and interests may yield excellent results     · engaging a pr campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business     · participating in writers’ conferences and pitch fests as well as submitting completed scripts for selection to film and theater festivals while winning a contest is obviously a good way to add value to the product even entering in such competitions will result in getting exposure for our company and in some cases in reviews   currently mr gardner promotes our products through many channels including networking at local film and theater festivals and internet sources as well as expanding his personal professional relationships with small and experimental studios and independent producers while mr gardner has limited experience in developing and expanding a client base and marketing products to them we anticipate that as the company grows over the next sixteen months pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the theater and film production industry and by the use of technical and marketing consultants which will allow qualified individuals to join mr gardner on our management team and board of directors   currently litera does not have any existing relationships with pr agents publicists producers or producer’s agents      table of contents   research and development   the company has not expended funds for research and development costs since inception other than utilizing mr gardner’s experiences and available industry and marketing information litera has not undertaken any research and development activities regarding our target market and marketability of our products   theatrical and film production industry   the major business centers of film and theatrical production are concentrated in the united states europe india and china the theatrical and film production industry consists of the technological and commercial institutions that are involved in creation of a film or stage performance such as production companies studios cinematography choreography production screenplaywriting preproduction post production film and theater festivals actors dancers singers film and theatrical producers directors and other personnel due to the great expense required to produce a movie or a stage play the making of a film or a performance usually has to be done in conjunction with an already established production company however the production of independent films and small scale stage performances has begun to evolve with the advent of more affordable equipment and more sophisticated consumer technology as well as the increasing visibility of independent festivals such as sundance film festival or contemporary american theater festival independent projects are often described as less commerciallydriven art forms which differ significantly from the norms of plotdriven mainstream classical hollywood cinema or broadway theater catering specifically to the needs of independent film and theatrical producers and small and experimental production studios is the focus of the company’s business   our significant employee   we currently have one employee mr gardner who is our founder and serves as our sole officer and director mr gardner currently devotes full time to our business and is responsible for our daily operations including product development sales and marketing fund raising implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan   our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of mr gardner this individual would be difficult or impossible to replace the loss of this key contributor or his failure to perform could materially and adversely affect our company’s operations while we may obtain key man insurance such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event this executive officer is lost   currently our officer and director receives no compensation for his services during the development stage of our business operations he is reimbursed for any outofpocket expenses he may incur on our behalf in the future we may approve payment of salaries for officers and directors but currently no such plans have been approved we anticipate adding two  employees over the next twelve  months one of which will be a screenplay writer we do not have any employment agreements in place with our officer and director we also do not currently have any benefits such as health or life insurance available to our employee   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we monitor our estimates on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate   certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require us to apply significant judgment in their application as a result these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying these policies we use our judgment in making certain assumption and estimates our critical accounting policies are outlined in note  in the notes to the financial statements      table of contents   results of operations for the three months ended september   and    we had  in revenues in the three months ended september   compared to  for the three months ended september   the decrease in revenue is a result of the sale of less literary and dramatic products we anticipate a continued trend of literary and dramatic product sales revenue as we continue to develop such products our operating expenses were  which consisted of professional fees of  and general and administrative expenses of  for the three months ended september   for the three months ended september   our operating expenses were  which consisted of professional fees of  and general and administrative expenses of  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses our net income was  for the three months ended september   and was  for the three months ended september   the decrease was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses   results of operations for the nine months ended september   and    we had  in revenues in the nine months ended september   and  in revenue from inception through september   our revenue increase is a result of the sale of more literary and dramatic products we anticipate a continued trend of literary and dramatic product sales revenue as we continue to develop such products our operating expenses were  which consisted of professional fees of  and general and administrative expenses of  for the nine months ended september   from inception through september   our operating expenses were  which consisted of professional fees of  and general and administrative expenses of  the increase in operating expenses are primarily due to increases in both professional fees as well as general and administrative costs our net income was  for the three months ended september   and was  from inception through september   the decrease was due to increased expenses   liquidity and capital resources   the companys cash position was  at september   as of september   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  respectively as of september   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  this resulted in a working capital of  at september   and a working capital of  at september     net cash used in operating activities amounted to  for the nine months ended september   this is primarily due to general operating expenses   net cash used in investing activities amounted to  for the nine months ended september     net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  for the nine months ended september     the company does not have sufficient capital to meet its current cash needs which include the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the company intends to seek additional capital through the sale literary and dramatic products financing options may be available to the company either via a private placement or through the public sale of stock there is no assurance however that the available funds will be available or adequate its need for additional financing is likely to persist   going concern   our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as of september   we have not generated significant revenues since inception we expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash our operations and any future financing however there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we will be required to obtain additional capital in the future to continue our operations and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital through equity or debt financing or any combination thereof or on satisfactory terms or at all additionally no assurance can be given that any such financing if obtained will be adequate to meet our capital needs if adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms our operations would be materially negatively impacted therefore our auditor has substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to complete additional offerings is dependent on the state of the debt andor equity markets at the time of any proposed offering and such market’s reception of the company and the offering terms there is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us and if available on terms and conditions that are acceptable   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements

litera’s management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within litera have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject
