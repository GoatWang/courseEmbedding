building something meaningful has long been my unreachable itch and is something i have been making conscious efforts to try to scratch meaningful although easy to expect is difficult to realise it implies there is an intrinsic idea that will transpire into a tool that other people will actually use actual people not friends colleagues clients or pets real people you may well be the shithot designer or developer on the scene that everyone is talking about but if you have arrived to where you are now without producing something meaningful and only you can ask yourself that question now is the time to stop what youre doing and channel how good you are into ticking that desirable life box research  develop user inerface  photography flayers  marketing   graphic design my imagination has always been an incredible driving force in my life and has done and still does have influence on almost everything i do it has always been the most natural and easiest way for me to express myself putting pencil brush or clay on a blank canvas and bringing something i or somebody has envisioned to life for others to enjoy and marvel at when reading a book i immerse myself into the characters and environments often sketching out a great scene with great emotion and gestures i often get people approach me to design them a logo tattoos or paint something for room decoration offers i always jump at it wasn’t until recently however that i have thought about pursuing art as a career it’s been a dream my whole life a dream that i never thought could really come true for me to be able to have a career in art is like winning the lottery but with support from people around me admiring my sketches sculpting’s and random musings and a fresh and yet more mature perspective on life i believe it’s about time i took a “leap of faith” looking forward i am excited and have an incredible drive to see where the future may take me flayers  branding marketing  develop user inerface  photography   branding beyond just a memorable logo good branding increases the value of a company provides employees with direction and motivation and makes acquiring new customers easier so what exactly is a brand the short answer is everything a brand represents the sum of people’s perception of a company’s customer service reputation advertising and logo when all of these parts of the business are working well the overall brand tends to be healthy on the flip side we all probably know a company that offers excellent products or services but has a tarnished brand due to poor customer service develop  marketing user inerface  photography flayers  research   web design designers need to know about aspects of a website that can and cant be achieved through development and why designers need to be able to produce and present prototypes that can be iterated and tweaked within the browser eradicating the waste of time that is producing high fidelity comps if designers need to go right developers need to budge left too developers need to consult with designers in regards to how a website design might adjust depending on the screen size how many designers design an individual comp for a mobile or tablet viewport i would be shocked if any  this task is notoriously left to the developer developers also need to adapt their code to suit the content a client has provided four weeks late and iterate quickly to accommodate such a change it just makes so much more sense to me for this process to just be the responsibility of one person and a browser ready to
