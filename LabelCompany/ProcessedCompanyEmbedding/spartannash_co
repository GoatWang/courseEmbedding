amazoncom inc is contracting with spartannash co to supply products to the ecommerce giants distribution centers dave staples spartannash chief operating officer spoke about the arrangement with investors during a recent conference call to discuss the companys fiscal  first quarter earnings we are excited about our relationship with amazon staples said while still a relatively new account the volume has been greater than we expected and we believe that it has significant growth potential spartannash operates about  stores across  states north dakota south dakota nebraska colorado minnesota iowa wisconsin michigan indiana and ohio but the majority of the byron townshipheadquartered corporations nearly  billion business is supplying independent grocers and small chains this relationship is a great example of our commitment to pursuing solutions for difficult logistic issues and we continue to look at opportunities to grow sales with other nontraditional customers staples said the work for amazon includes supplying products to the companys distribution centers for them to sell staples said work for the seattle online giant fits into the companys normal distribution model although the mix of products are different from what is supplied to other wholesale customers he said spartannash is primarily supporting amazons prime nows sameday deliveries but is beginning to expand into amazons recently announced fresh service that will deliver perishables to customers doors the products currently supplied by spartannash fall under the dry and chill category staples said i think our reputation with them has expanded and thats how the fresh group has gotten interested staples said spartannash ceo dennis eidson mentioned the arrangement during the previous earnings call in february a company spokeswoman declined to provide any additional information at the time during the call the company leaders also announced plans to rebanner eight omaha area stores to family fare

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

this item       votes byron center — despite a first quarter revenue decline executives at grocery retailer and food distributor spartannash co say they’re hungry for new business opportunities and possibly acquisitions speaking with analysts on a quarterly conference call thursday executives at the byron centerbased company said they were “generally pleased” with the first quarter performance and believe there’s significant opportunity to continue growing the business as deals heat up in the industry “i think ma was healthy over the last couple of years and i think it remained healthy going into this year and there is opportunity that we will continue to explore” said christopher meyers spartannash’s executive vice president and cfo “but we want to make sure that whatever we do is a good deal” additionally spartannash nasdaq sptn says it’s in the early stages of a new distribution partnership with online retailer amazoncom inc executive vice president and cfo david staples told analysts that selling products to amazon is a natural expansion for spartannash which already sells food through a variety of channels such as retail stores and to the military “we are distributing products to amazon’s distribution centers for them to sell” staples said “so they fit into that normal model … we are servicing the prime now predominantly but also beginning to grow into the food and staple delivery option fresh a little bit” staples described the work with amazon as “a great relationship” while spartannash executives remain bullish on further opportunities analysts on the call pointed out that the major driver for the company in the first quarter came from the distribution segment ceo dennis eidson said he doesn’t minimize the company’s lack of topline growth but the focus remains on integrating spartannash’s various business units and concentrating on logistics issues “we’ve really put a lot of effort into this network” eidson said “and when i talk about the network were really talking about a combination of our food distribution and military network to really begin to look at it more as one overall network dedicated to continuing to offer solutions to very complicated logistics issues and we’ve elevated our thinking along those lines and we’ve really pushed the business hard along those lines” additionally executives at the company see further growth opportunities as spartannash continues its expansion into the omaha neb market over the rest of the year spartannash reported  billion in first quarter sales down from  billion in the same period in  adjusted earnings were  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the same period a year ago as the company looks forward for the rest of the year executives say that despite some uncertainty when it comes to regional challenges and overall macroeconomic hurdles the outlook for the remainder of  is largely positive we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year given the deflationary environment and economic pressures in certain regions” eidson said in a statement “we continue to focus on our western retail operations and will fully launch our family fare brand in omaha during the second half of the year this will include enhancing our merchandising pricing and promotional strategies including expanding our organic and private label product offerings and driving greater customer engagement through our loyalty program” read  times tweet published in in the news tagged under spartannash co christopher meyers amazoncom inc david staples

merger synergy company exceeds earnings guidance samestore sales flat august    pm spartannash cos consolidated net sales for the second quarter ending july  increased  percent to  billion compared to  million last year primarily due to  billion in sales generated as a result of last novembers merger of spartan stores with nash finch co reported operating earnings increased  percent to  million compared to  million for the prior year quarter primarily due to contributions from the merger with nash finch these benefits were partially offset by the impact of low inflation increased integration restructuring and asset impairment charges additional lifo expense and a pension settlement accounting charge “we are pleased to have exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance for the second quarter” said dennis eidson spartannash president and ceo “the earnings upside was driven primarily by continued favorable synergy realization and our retail segment while the quarter started off slowly due to the later timing of easter sales trends improved as the quarter progressed and the retail division achieved positive comparable store sales over the back half of the second quarter despite some softening in the consumer environment we have also made significant progress with our merger integration efforts and remain committed to providing excellent service and value to all of our retail food distribution and military customers” running the numbers adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were  million or  cents per diluted share compared to  million or  cents per diluted share last year gross profit margin for q was  percent compared to  percent in the prior year the change in gross profit margin rate primarily reflects the change in the segment mix of operations due to the merger and the impact of continued low inflation net sales for the food distribution segment increased  percent to  million in q from  million for the yearago period the increase in sales was due to  million in sales from nash finch partially offset by the negative effect of the change in timing of the easter holiday and the reduction in the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap net sales for the retail segment increased  percent to  million in q from  million a year ago primarily due to  million in sales generated as a result of the merger and new and remodeled stores comparable store sales excluding fuel were flat to the prior year primarily due to the later timing of easter which adversely affected the results by approximately  basis points and the impact of the cutbacks in snap benefits in addition retail sales reflect  million in fewer sales due to the store closures during the second quarter the company completed three major remodels and began construction on two new stores additionally two supermarkets were sold to distribution customers and one underperforming supermarket was closed spartannash ended the quarter with
