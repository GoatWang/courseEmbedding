read it carefully before you invest or send money letter from the funds president dear shareholder the past twoplus years have been a very challenging time for the global stock markets slowing economic growth and weaker corporate earnings have produced a difficult investment environment around the world as  progresses however the picture is becoming brighter as global economic growth appears to be picking up steam this has proven beneficial for investors in funds that invest in international equities as the asset class has enjoyed a modest comeback since september  as the rebound in the global economy unfolds we urge investors to remain patient since the process of recovery is likely to be slow and uneven in many parts of the world against this backdrop it is reasonable to expect that stock prices will remain highly sensitive to shortterm news developments making days where the markets rise or fall  percent fairly commonplace it is at these times  when stock prices are gyrating wildly and the market outlook is changing by the day  that it becomes more important than ever to keep your longterm goals in mind and to remain focused on stocks longterm potential rather than their daily fluctuations sincerely william f glavin jr president scudder global discovery fund aarp investment program scudder class s web site aarpscuddercom myscuddercom tollfree  scudder

for the funds most uptodate performance portfolio management review in the following interview lead portfolio manager gerry moran discusses scudder global discovery funds strategy and the market environment during the sixmonth period ended april   q please provide a brief overview of global equity markets for the semiannual period ending april   a global markets rebounded in october and november following their sharp declines in the wake of the september  attacks in the united states december was more mixed and  has thus far been greeted with several critical events • the collapse of enron in the united states and the subsequent attention to accounting concerns around the world • a strongerthanexpected pickup in the us economy sparked by the american consumer but generally not supported by corporate profits • military activity in afghanistan • increasing violence in the middle east and the related focus on oil prices in january many investors in the united states and europe took profits after the runup in late  since then markets have stabilized somewhat in response to improving economic indicators as well as more optimistic business and consumer sentiment given this improving scenario fueled so strongly by the consumer its no surprise which industries performed the best for the period under review consumer durables apparel companies and other luxury goods manufacturers all had a nice rebound on prospects for economic growth as did automobiles capital goods transportation and materials businesses food beverage and tobacco companies also did well on the flip side telecommunications led the list of laggards for the sixmonth period followed closely by technology hardware and equipment insurance media pharmaceuticals and food and drug retailing also struggled q what was the performance of scudder global discovery fund against this sixmonth backdrop a against what we believe is a clearly improving economic environment the salomon smith barney world equity emi gained  percent for the semiannual period ending april   while scudder global discovery fund posted  percent class s shares the ssb world equity emi benchmark is an unmanaged capitalizationweighted measure of smallcapitalization stocks in  countries around the world the funds growth bias currently gravitates against our efforts to remain on par with the funds benchmark value outpaced growth by nearly six percentage points during the period a trend that was particularly evident over the past two months we had hoped to shield the portfolio from the economically sensitive areas of the economy by focusing on health care however biotechnology stocks were very weak during the period under review and even those businesses that produce consumables used in medical and other types of testing were hurt by the sectors downturn theres a clear dichotomy in the health care industry though because while the funds biotechrelated holdings hurt us the funds stake in hospitals health care equipment and pharmacy management businesses all contributed significantly to performance in fact nearly half of the portfolios top  holdings at the end of the period were in health care the other half of the top holdings fall among financials including irish life  permanent anglo irish bank legg mason and deutsche boerse these all gave a nice boost to the funds returns for the semiannual period q youve indicated that the value bias of the markets has held the fund back for a while when do you foresee these circumstances changing and have there been any adjustments to the portfolio to accommodate the markets bias a all the attention to value stocks will eventually drive up their prices then of course they cease to be value stocks by definition value being akin to a stock on sale capital spending will need to revive and unemployment will need to stabilize in order for us to have a sustainable economic recovery in which growth stocks could perform well there are also other considerations with respect to catalysts for this funds performance though most significantly the united states may cease to be the engine for global growth in this case we would expect to see our holdings in europe and japan do better than those in the united states in the s the strength of the us markets worked against the fund because of its substantial holdings in these markets i believe the next  years could be quite different whats more in my view a decline in the strength of the dollar will immediately be translated into a positive for this portfolio and all global funds its important to note that during time periods when markets were more hospitable to growthbiased small companies our stock selection stands out this is evidenced in the funds longerterm performance which includes more hospitable environments as of april   scudder global discovery fund class s shares has outperformed its benchmark and the average of its lipper peers for the three five and year periods please see page click here for details on lipper rankings  scudder global discovery fund class s shares ranked    and  for the year year year and year periods ended  there were    and  funds respectively in lippers global smallcap funds category ranking is based on the funds total return during the periods cited performance includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and is no guarantee of future results source lipper inc as of  for now however to position the portfolio in the current environment we have made some changes to the weightings in the funds structure which is centered on four building blocks • stable growth stocks  to  percent of the portfolio  percent as of april   • stocks with growthatreasonablevalue prices  to  percent of the portfolio  percent as of april   • specialized growth stocks  to  percent of the portfolio  percent as of april   • highgrowth stocks  to  percent of the portfolio  percent as of april    an example of a specialized stock could be a pharmaceutical that focuses on one or two very specific kinds of products such as prosthetics or a specific family of medications we have positioned the portfolio so that the highergrowth stocks specialized and high growth are at the lower end of their ranges while stable growth and growthatvalue stocks are slightly more heavily weighted in theory these latter stocks can perform marginally better in a valuebiased environment q the fund recently experienced a change in its investment advisor how has this change affected the management of this portfolio a since the last annual report there has been a portfolio management change that is associated with the change in investment advisor sewall hodges who had previously served as portfolio manager on this fund is once again part of the team replacing steve stokes twothirds of sewalls career has been devoted to following companies on a global basis sewall joined the firm in  with  years of investment research portfolio

based on portfolio management’s belief that over time stocks which display more favorable financial metrics for example the croci® economic pe ratio as generated by this process may outperform stocks which display less favorable metrics this premise may not prove to be correct and prospective investors should evaluate this assumption prior to investing in the fund the fund’s use of forward currency contracts may not be successful in hedging currency exchange rates changes and could eliminate some or all of the benefit of an increase in the value of a foreign currency versus the us
