images by dan emmett by dan emmett march   dan emmett a former marine corps captain retired secret service agent and former cia intelligence officer is the author of “within arm’s length a secret service agent’s definitive inside account of protecting the president” forthcoming in june these are disturbing days for the agency charged with protecting the president of the united states from prostitutes in colombia to drunkenness in amsterdam it is no wonder that so many members of congress — as well as former agents — have lost patience with a secret service that can’t seem to stay out of the news with embarrassing and highprofile cases of misconduct i was a secret service agent for  years spent two tours of duty on the presidential protective division and four years on the counter assault team cat and was part of trips for three presidents i retired  years ago and have no dog in today’s agency fights i do not believe that alcohol abuse is a cultural problem within the secret service in fact many agents do not drink at all and those who do tend to consume in moderation the problem in the agency is not alcohol or debauchery but weak leadership there are too many incompetent managers who want the title pay and perks of management while performing no duties of leadership the problem is not bad secret service agents but bad leaders of secret service agents the united states secret service was created in  and began protecting the president in  during  years of presidential protection the agency accompanied presidents on hundreds of thousands of domestic and overseas trips without bringing any unwanted attention upon itself that is because in my experience agents tend to be intelligent welltrained and fiercely patriotic americans — nearly fanatical in their devotion to the mission at hand yet history shows that even the best units perform poorly with poor leaders and the secret service is a prime example the most disturbing common thread among the recent episodes of misconduct is that supervisors or team leaders have been involved while it is unacceptable for any agent to commit infractions such as those in amsterdam and colombia it is utterly inexcusable for those in charge to be involved if managers show continued lapses in judgment how and why would anyone expect the rank and file to behave better the secret service may not admit it but its promotion system is primarily designed to move the bestliked people not necessarily the bestqualified into managerial positions much like in a college fraternity a small group of senior agents votes on who will be promoted these decisions are based as much on office politics popularity and political correctness as the abilities of those being considered for upward mobility while this practice is widespread in many professions it is unacceptable in an agency whose primary function is to keep the president of the united states alive and safe competence should be the overriding concern in all government agencies but especially so in an organization whose agents stand next to the president and other top officials with loaded firearms the agency doesn’t prioritize competence among its managers yet it somehow stands baffled about why it cannot control the behavior of its agents forcing the director to return to capitol hill again and again to apologize for their conduct the apologies may temporarily appease critics but they do nothing to address the catastrophic failure of leadership within the organization when i became a secret service agent in  we were generally well led most of our top and midlevel supervisors were armed forces veterans they managed and led by the ethos of military leadership which dictates accomplishing the mission while taking care of those entrusted to them they expected much from their subordinates but knew that they must set the example we would follow the secret service of today is awash in managers not leaders many supervisors have little tangible or leadership experience yet they are designated as managers on the basis of their titles and long lists of schools attended alas leadership cannot be taught in a classroom alone in the military people must first pass officer candidate school before assuming leadership roles in the federal government more often than not people are promoted first and then trained to be leaders — the concept is entirely backward in december the department of homeland security’s inspector general issued a report finding no evidence that “misconduct is widespread” in the secret service though it was dismissed as a whitewash by some critics i view the findings to be quite correct the problem of leadership however stems in part from the department’s oversight of the secret service from its creation until shortly after the sept   attacks the secret service fell under the treasury department where it operated efficiently and largely unencumbered however after osama bin laden attacked america the secret service became part of the department of homeland security — a massive and nightmarish new federal bureaucracy in this environment many young and illprepared agents were promoted to positions of management far too early in their careers to supervise a significant number of new positions today many of those agents who were promoted too soon are at the highest levels of the secret service

in may the leaders discussed additional sanctions to punish russia for its incursion into ukraine charles dharapakap buy photo wait  second to continue whenever an elite organization expands too rapidly care must be taken not to compromise standards unfortunately this was not always done during the large expansion of the secret service that followed sept  the tragedy of this horrid and ineffective system is that many highly qualified agents who would be superb leaders are passed over for promotion they are not in “the club” the result is evident in today’s embarrassing headlines can this train wreck be put back on track can the secret service regain its respect i believe it can but congressional overseers need to agree that there is a massive leadership problem in the agency and start a general purge of some toplevel managers through forced retirement then the secret service should begin a leadership school for entrylevel managers preferably conducted by the military while major corporations and the federal government have become huge proponents of every type of management and business school imaginable and have spent millions of dollars sending their neophyte managers to them the military best understands leadership in its most basic form — and that is what the secret service is missing finally the next director should come from outside the agency rather than rising up through the rank and file when drastic changes are needed it is difficult for someone who is friends with almost everyone in headquarters to make objective decisions in this case the agency needs someone with no allegiances to toplevel managers the best leaders willingly take responsibility for the actions of their people when i was a yearold second lieutenant with the st marine division my first company commander informed me that he would hold me responsible for everything my men did or failed to do his hard lesson it is the commander who bears the ultimate responsibility for subordinates’ actions this lesson seems to be unique to the military though it should apply nonuniformed government workers too if highranking officials were terminated or disciplined for the infractions of their wayward subordinates rather than the wrongdoers themselves receiving all the punishment perhaps there would be fewer incidents such as the ones haunting the secret service of late

bpfox click to enlarge health warrior health warrior helped the tarahumara reclaim a droughtridden farm to produce its first crop of commercial chia seeds each tiny one is planted by hand it’s a daunting trip to the bottom of mexico’s barrancas del cobre the copper canyons of the sierra madre the cliffs are high — higher than the grand canyon’s — and the winding roads to the bottom are narrow with a sheer precipice that hugs the tires of a rugged suv all the way down “lots of bad things happen down there and probably will” christopher mcdougall writes in his book “born to run” “survive the maneating jaguars deadly snakes and blistering heat and you’ve still got to deal with ‘canyon fever’ a potentially fatal freakout brought on by the barrancas’ desolate eeriness” click to enlarge health warrior mexico’s vast barrancas del cobre are larger than the grand canyon but it isn’t all freaky emptiness — people live there the tarahumara are an indigenous people whose members retreated to this unforgiving part of mexico when the spanish conquistadors arrived they have limited contact with the outside world and the tribe ekes out a living through subsistence farming still that’s not what fascinates most people about the tarahumara they are despite or perhaps because of the formidable terrain the best longdistance runners in the world and there’s an unexpected connection between this remote running tribe that lives deep in the canyons of mexico — and richmond chia seeds more specifically the company that popularized them in the united states — scott’s additionbased health warrior — directly links them to this city mcdougall’s bestselling book inspired the company’s founders shane emmett dan gluck and nick morris to swerve unexpectedly into entrepreneurship click to enlarge scott elmquist the chia bars produced by health warrior are selling by the millions after reading “born to run” morris began experimenting with the tiny seeds that the tarahumara mix with water — called iskiate by the tribe or chia fresca in central america — to help keep them going on their long grueling runs in his s morris says his diet “had gone to crap” but after he began consuming chia he says “i started feeling better i started losing weight and having more energy” the nutrientdense seeds are loaded with fiber protein antioxidants and omega fatty acids but they were difficult to find morris asked his friend dan gluck what he thought about them gluck a dedicated long distance runner who still competes in ironman competitions and marathons across the country says he became like morris obsessed with chia “i really started noticing a difference in my overall level of energy” gluck says “it was then that i started telling other friends about them — with no intention of starting a business” in  both men were working together at a hedge fund in new york but there was a key difference between the two gluck was an investor in the coconut water company zico — and he started drawing parallels “zico took a product that was genuinely healthy indigenous to another country — and popular in another country — but unknown here in the states” gluck says he saw an opportunity to bring chia seeds to a wider audience click to enlarge dan gluck cofounder dan gluck finds the strength to plug health warrior during the grueling obstacle course of the spartan race but neither gluck nor morris wanted to ditch their day jobs and work fulltime to launch a new business they were spending nights researching chia and looking for suppliers and they needed help enter shane emmett — “the greatest human being in the world” morris says emmett a former lawyer for barack obama’s campaign was finishing up a stint working for thengovernor tim kaine emmett was at loose ends the call from gluck his former college roommate came at the perfect time “i didn’t want to go work for a real law firm” emmett says “working for kaine was the most interesting legal job i’d ever have” like morris emmett was getting older and wasn’t in the best of shape he’d reached a point that most of us do when we hit our s — the realization that we aren’t immortal that health matters all three men had been athletes in college but only gluck was still active more importantly emmett also was ready for a new cause “in typical shane fashion” morris says “a day later we’ve got a page report of how great chia is and what an opportunity this is” a foodindustry startup is expensive so the partners decided to start selling their product on amazon the three found a source in south america that could provide the kind of chia seeds they were looking for a clean product for one thing tiny sticks and rocks usually came along with seeds at the time they also found one that could be tracked from the farm to the distributor and matched the nutritional profile claimed and fortunately chia is a hardy plant so it’s unusual for farmers to use pesticides on their crops even irrigation is mostly unnecessary there wasn’t a lot happening with the seeds online the three were working out of their homes and had garages piled with product emmett says he had  pounds of chia seeds stored in his condo’s hallway at one point a cofounder of bear naked granola kelly flatly gave them some advice get health warrior into independent natural food stores click to enlarge health warrior health warrior’s cofounder nick morris and its chief financial officer austin harris meet with arnulfo qimare the tarahumara runner made famous in “born to run” on a visit last year to the barrancas qimare competed in the  boston marathon wearing handmade huaraches and traditional garb emmett enlisted his brother casey who lived in new york and the two began trying to convince store owners to give them shelf space they figured out which were the topselling stores in the country — surprisingly richmond’s ellwood thompson’s local market held the no  spot the rest unsurprisingly were scattered throughout manhattan and brooklyn the brothers convinced stores to take the product on consignment with ellwood thompson owner rick hood as their first supporter it was a hard sell to customers at demos they offered samples of the seeds mixed in water “honestly” casey says “it grosses people out” it’s a drink that’s been compared to frog spawn — chia seeds soak up the water around them and form a gray gel leaving the little black seed right in the middle suspended in the drink although chia is almost tasteless the texture that it creates is an unusual one — slick with a little pop when you crunch it between your teeth making it tougher no one knew anything about the seeds for most people the terracotta chia pets hawked on television was the only frame of reference “if we sold  bags in a week” casey says “we were psyched” it wasn’t long before emmett gluck and morris realized that they needed to sell the seeds in a more palatable form but they wanted a specific product one that was a legitimately healthy snack — packed with nutrients lowcalorie and low in sugar — that tasted great most of the health bars on the shelves — clif bar and lunabar leading the way — largely were things full of sugar that could be called cookies with added nutrients “my theory” emmett says “is that sugar is a lot cheaper than using chia seeds or pumpkin seeds or almonds” if you pump up the sugar you can pump up the profits once they had a bar they liked things began puttering along with the retail business and then all hell broke loose click to enlarge scott elmquist the company’s chief executive shane emmett has no plans to move health warriors’ headquarters out of scott’s addition shane emmett is a towering bearded man in his late s — you can instantly see why he was an athlete in college he’s also quick to smile and he finds ways to tell his story that’s endearingly selfdeprecating even though he’s been running the show at health warrior since his partners more or less took a back seat once the initial team was in place “it’s quite remarkable” gluck says “but during the five years or so we’ve run this company we’ve never had one disagreement or argument” with his partners up in new york emmett ran — and still runs — the daytoday operations of the business in richmond that meant a lot of traveling pounding the pavement and instore demos “we were going around and just asking for a shot” his brother says “we didn’t know how to write an invoice — we didn’t even know how much this stuff should cost” within one hour period that all changed the wall street journal published a story about baltimore ravens running back ray rice and his secret superfood “i was not aware that ray rice eats chia pets” teammate terrell suggs said in the article the product sold out on amazon in an hour and health warrior suddenly had a supply problem “we were totally out of stock for two months” emmett says about a month later whole foods came knocking it wanted to launch the bars nationally “we had no money we barely had employees and didn’t know what we were doing” emmett says they had four months to get the bars on whole foods’ shelves jesse itzler a former rapper under the name jesse jaymes and a partner in zico through which he met gluck came in as an investor in the company in what emmett calls a friendsandfamily round of financing the local investor group new richmond ventures came aboard too soon once health warrior found its place on whole foods’ shelves it found athletes investing including running back arian foster of the houston texans he also became the face of the brand in the early days growth was explosive austin harris a young analyst at bbt capital markets had taken the leap in  coming on as chief financial officer “bbt thought i was insane” he says his coworkers gave him a chia pet as a parting gift click to enlarge scott elmquist the members of heath warrior’s team avidly pursue outdoor sports and share a commitment to change the american diet they work in two buildings across the street from each other near isley brewing co harris helped the company get up to speed establishing payroll and accounting systems as health warrior rapidly expanded like the founders he’s passionate about the outdoors — running cycling and hiking he also worked with a lot of foodrelated businesses at bbt “i’m a really active person” harris says “those two themes collided right around the time i met shane” emmett knew he needed a finance guy — “someone who can count” he said harris created the financial backbone of the company at the same time emmett “never thought of health warrior as a company that’s just going to make a product and sell it to people” harris says “that’s never what it’s been about health warrior — and shane and our other two founders — has always been about making the western diet in general much better making people healthier” it’s a theme i hear repeatedly from everyone i talk to at health warrior it’s a team of true believers the bars are “radically convenient real food” they tell me “if we actually want to change things” emmett says “we can do it much more quickly and build value at the same time by doing it in our industry — which is exactly what we’re doing we’re not the food police but food cheerleaders” the growth has continued apace —  percent since  to be exact “our first run was  bars” emmett says “we had no idea how we were going to sell all of them— the first batch came in the wrong wrappers and the chia seeds were black and got stuck in your teeth” health warrior now produces millions of bars a month in a manufacturing plant in ohio and the company has gone from around  stores in the beginning to more than  now you can find them in target wegmans and kroger supermarkets across the country two years ago industry group seurat named health warrior as one of the top challenger brands and in  it took the no  spot in inc magazine’s list of the  fastestgrowing companies inc reported that the company’s revenue was  million in  although emmett declined to share more recent figures it now has  fulltime employees including a sales team that stretches nationwide and a product line that’s expanded to include a protein bar and one made with pumpkin seeds that recently launched at wegmans health warrior rounds out its staff with another  parttime employees and  independent contractors it’s a long way to come in five years and more expansion is on the horizon — the company recently secured another round of financing “we’re really building the company this year for what we’ll need next year” says emmett still emmett gluck and morris haven’t forgotten the people who metaphorically handed them their first chia seeds — the tarahumara the region has experienced crippling drought during the last few years and the tribe’s farms have been decimated people are moving to towns and cities and if the trend continues it’s possible that the tarahumara culture will be lost click to enlarge health warrior the first health warriorfunded farm inspired the company to create a mexican chocolate bar for operation farm  run a kickstarter to help the tarahumara grow chia for the company last year members of the tribe grew their first commercial crop of chia seeds on a farm that health warrior helped restore and several weeks ago the company launched a kickstarter campaign operation farm  run to continue its work it’s making a special mexican chocolate bar that will use seed grown by the tarahumara profits from the bars’ sales will go back to the tribe to help refurbish more farms and increase commercial chia production the work is in line with health warrior’s mission emmett and his partners are sincere when they say that they want to leave the world a better place along with “born to run” two more books michael pollan’s “the omnivore’s dilemma a natural history in four meals” and dan barber’s “the third plate field notes on the future of food” have inspired the three to push the company in a direction that takes into account more than the bottom line — health a better planet and a hand stretched out to those in need are instead the goals that the company’s profits support “our vision is that better health builds a stronger society” emmett says “it’s hard to have a healthy society if it isn’t actually healthy — people don’t feel good and it ladders up that’s what we think so we’re doing our little part to try and fix that” s « qa is richmond a sanctuary city yes and no      the  state of the plate » tweet favorite saving… email share more cover story »
