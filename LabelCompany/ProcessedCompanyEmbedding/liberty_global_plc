rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too

global plc as well travis hoium tmfflushdraw feb   at pm liberty global plc nasdaqlbtyk reported fourthquarter earnings monday and also announced a merger with vodafone nasdaqvod the two companies will combine forces in the netherlands to deliver a more wellrounded suite of products to customers there but before we get to that deal lets go through the companys raw numbers   liberty global plc results the raw numbers   q  actuals q  actuals growth yoy sales  billion  billion  operating income  million  million  free cash flow  million  million  data source company earnings release what happened with liberty global plc a total of  revenue generating units or rgus were added in the fourth quarter it was the best quarter in a year that saw  organic rgu additions if you adjust for currency management said revenue was up  in  operating cash flow grew  and free cash flow was up    cash is being used at a rapid rate to buy back shares in  buybacks were  billion and management expects another  billion in buybacks by the end of  in the lilac group which includes operations in chile and puerto rico revenue grew  on a rebased basis to  billion and free cash flow jumped  to  million interest on its debt reached a record low of  this helps put strong leverage on the balance sheet and allows for acquisitions or share buybacks  of customers subscribed to a tripleplay product  subscribed to a doubleplay product and  subscribed to a singleplay product the company noted the opportunity to upsell subscribers what management had to say cable customers continue to slowly fade away but broadband and mobile continue to improve for liberty global operations in europe are also improving as the economy slowly picks up there and customers begin demanding faster broadband connections the  merger of vodafones mobile operations in the netherlands with ziggos broadband network will also help drive the companys broader adoption in the country this will make the triple play more compelling for consumers and repeats a strategy liberty global has been using across europe and latin america   the dutch transaction likely wont close until the end of  but look for it to be a potentially lucrative growth market for liberty global with  million euros of cost synergies already identified by the two companies looking forward in many ways the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year for liberty global despite currency headwinds from a strong dollar the strategy of investing in faster broadband and more triple play options for customers is paying off and that should continue in  the continued momentum in share repurchases should also help shareholders over the next couple of years liberty global isnt a company that chooses to pay dividends so thats the best way the company can pay back shareholders and boost earnings per share in the future travis hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends liberty global try any of our foolish
