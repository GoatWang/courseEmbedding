fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations this seasonality has resulted and may continue to result in fluctuations in bluegreens quarterly operating results although bluegreen typically sees more potential customers at its sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to down payment requirements for recognition of real estate sales under gaap or due to the timing of development and the required use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting voi notes receivable and allowance for credit losses bluegreen offers financing to buyers of vois and accordingly bluegreen is subject to the risk of defaults by these customers pursuant to gaap sales of vois are reduced by an estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated voi notes receivable excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries of defaulted voi inventory bluegreen updates its estimate of such future losses each quarter and consequently the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods bluegreens notes receivable also include amounts outstanding under bluegreen communities notes receivable portfolio which was excluded from bluegreens sale during may  of substantially all of the assets of bluegreen communities substantially all defaulted voi notes receivable result in a recovery of the related voi that secured the note receivable typically soon after default and at a nominal cost bluegreen then seeks to resell the recovered voi in the normal course of business bluegreen generally seeks to monetize its notes receivable by transferring the notes to warehouse purchase facilities in which case the notes are legally sold to a special purpose entity for the benefit of a financial institution or conduit or by pledging the notes as collateral for a receivables hypothecation loan bluegreen attempts to maintain these diversified liquidity sources for its notes receivable in order to mitigate the risks of being dependent on a single source of credit each such facility has eligibility standards for the notes receivable that may be sold or pledged under the facility it is generally expected that notes receivable transferred to a warehouse purchase facility will ultimately be included in a future securitization of the transferred notes the notes receivable securitized are determined during the negotiation of the securitization transaction with the characteristics of the notes receivable selected determining the terms of the transaction notes receivable previously pledged as collateral for a receivable hypothecation loan may also be included in a term securitization transaction however such notes are generally not included if doing so would result in a significant prepayment penalty further based on the size and timing of the securitization bluegreen may also choose to include newly originated notes receivable additionally the specific characteristics of the notes receivable factor into whether such notes would be desirable to include in a securitization such factors may include delinquency status ficor score of the borrower interest rate remaining term outstanding balance and whether the borrower is foreign or domestic the average annual default rates and delinquency rates more than  days past due on bluegreens notes receivable were as follows average annual default rates for year ended december     notes
