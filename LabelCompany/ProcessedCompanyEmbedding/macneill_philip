scattered throughout the country brewing industry brewing began in canada with the first settlers and traders in the beginning beer making was a cottage industry but in  canadas first commercial brewery was built by the intendant jean talon at québec city the enterprise was undertaken for three purposes to promote temperance by offering an alternative to strong imported french liquors to reduce the amount of currency leaving the country for the purchase of imported beverages and to utilize the abundance of grain available in the new world in its early development period the industry consisted of small independent breweries scattered throughout the country with the advent of modern distribution systems technological advances to improve quality control and rising costs production became more centralized and most local breweries disappeared however during the s a resurgence of smaller breweries commonly called microbreweries began to appear in canada they tend to serve local or regional markets today canadas brewing industry comprises two national companies labatt breweries of canada  plants and molson breweries  plants and six regional breweries located in different areas of canada big rock brewery and drummond brewing alberta lakeport brewing corporation northern breweries and north algonquin breweries ontario moosehead breweries limited new brunswick pacific western brewing company british columbia and sleeman brewing and malting company limited ontario and british columbia  additionally there are  microbreweries in every area of canada except new brunswick nova scotia prince edward island and the yukon and northwest territories in a little more than a decade the canadian brewing trade has changed dramatically for example there has been the emergence of the brew pub a combined brewery and licensed pub selling beer for onpremise consumption only these establishments enjoyed a renaissance as a result of the real ale movement in europe brew pubs have been operating in canada since  types of beer beer is used as a generic term and includes both lager and ale of the range of beer types available to consumers today lager is preferred by most canadians  followed by ale  the difference between the two is that lager is lighter in taste and is made with a type of yeast that drops to the bottom of the fermenting tank more hops are used to brew ale and the yeast rises to the top of the tank less than  of the market is sold as stout heavybodied darker and sweeter beer brewed with roasted malt and more hops and porter a weaker version of stout light beers containing up to  alcohol by volume were introduced in canada in the late s regularstrength canadian beers contain  alcohol by volume in the past several years both large and small brewers have expanded their range of products to offer consumers more selection to meet different tastes new brewing technologies and processes have produced the following types of beer extra light dry extra dry

canada breweries must obtain licences to operate from both the federal and provincial governments generally the provinces have control over distribution and retail systems labelling advertising and marketing practices importation and pricing they may as well control the number and types of beers available for sale the federal government regulates ingredients packaging and labelling and broadcast advertising taxes represent the single largest component of the price of beer on average  cents of every dollar spent on beer for home consumption is made up of federal and provincial taxes at this level canada ranks with norway as having the highest taxes of  leading industrialized countries canadian taxes are about three times higher than on beer bought in the united states where only  cents on each dollar goes to taxes economic contributions in  the beverage industries produced  billion and grew at an average compounded annual rate of almost  over the  to  period in  the brewery products

that can last  to  years before they too are also crushed and recycled even the husks of the spent grain used in the brewing process are recycled after use in the brewing process they are collected and sold as animal feed responsible use the canadian brewing industry was one of the first among brewers internationally to address the issue of responsible use and continues to fund a number of programs aimed at discouraging misuse in the past decade alone the industry has provided funding of over  million to raise public awareness of the risks of alcohol misuse to mount educational programs
