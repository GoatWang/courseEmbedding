of investments unaudited  organization franklin high income trust trust is registered under the investment company act of  as amended as an openend investment company consisting of one fund the franklin high income fund fund  financial instrument valuation the funds investments in financial instruments are carried at fair value daily fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date under procedures approved by the trusts board of trustees the board the funds administrator investment manager and other affiliates have formed the valuation and liquidity oversight committee vloc the vloc provides administration and oversight of the funds valuation policies and procedures which are approved annually by the board among other things these procedures allow the fund to utilize independent pricing services quotations from securities and financial instrument dealers and other market sources to determine fair value equity securities listed on an exchange or on the nasdaq national market system are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of the day respectively foreign equity securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock exchange on which the security is primarily traded or the nyse whichever is earlier the value is then converted into its us dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the nyse on the day that the value of the security is determined overthecounter otc securities are valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices securities that trade in multiple markets or on multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative market certain equity securities are valued based upon fundamental characteristics or relationships to similar securities investments in openend mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value debt securities generally trade in the otc market rather than on a securities exchange the funds pricing services use multiple valuation techniques to determine fair value in instances where sufficient market activity exists the pricing services may utilize a marketbased approach through which quotes from market makers are used to determine fair value in instances where sufficient market activity may not exist or is limited the pricing services also utilize proprietary valuation models which may consider market characteristics such as benchmark yield curves credit spreads estimated default rates anticipated market interest rate volatility coupon rates anticipated timing of principal repayments underlying collateral and other unique security features in order to estimate the relevant cash flows which are then discounted to calculate the fair value securities denominated in a foreign currency are converted into their us dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the nyse on the date that the values of the foreign debt securities are determined certain derivative financial instruments derivatives trade in the otc market the funds pricing services use various techniques including industry standard option pricing models and proprietary discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of those instruments the funds net benefit or obligation under the derivative contract as measured by the fair market value of the contract is included in net assets   the fund has procedures to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which market prices are not reliable or readily available under these procedures the vloc convenes on a regular basis to review such financial instruments and considers a number of factors including significant unobservable valuation inputs when arriving at fair value the vloc primarily employs a marketbased approach which may use related or comparable assets or liabilities recent transactions market multiples book values and other relevant information for the investment to determine the fair value of the investment an incomebased valuation approach may also be used in which the anticipated future cash flows of the investment are discounted to calculate fair value discounts may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investments due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of such investments the fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market existed the vloc employs various methods for calibrating these valuation approaches including a regular review of key inputs and assumptions transactional backtesting or disposition analysis and reviews of any related market activity trading in securities on foreign securities stock exchanges and otc markets may be completed before the daily close of business on the nyse occasionally events occur between the time at which trading in a foreign security is completed and the close of the nyse that might call into question the reliability of the value of a portfolio security held by the fund as a result differences may arise between the value of the funds portfolio securities as determined at the foreign market close and the latest indications of value at the close of the nyse in order to minimize the potential for these differences the vloc monitors price movements following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of country specific market proxies such as baskets of american depositary receipts futures contracts and exchange traded funds these price movements are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred that may call into question the reliability of the values of the foreign securities held by the fund if such an event occurs the securities may be valued using fair value procedures which may include the use of independent pricing services in addition certain foreign markets may be open on days that the nyse is closed which could result in differences between the value of the funds portfolio securities on the last business day and the last calendar day of the reporting period any significant security valuation changes due to an open foreign market are adjusted and reflected by the fund for financial reporting purposes  derivative financial instruments the fund invested in derivatives in order to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market factors and require or permit net settlement derivatives contain various risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their obligations under the terms of the contract the potential for an illiquid secondary market andor the potential for market movements derivative counterparty credit risk is managed through a formal evaluation of the creditworthiness of all potential counterparties the fund attempts to reduce its exposure to counterparty credit risk on otc derivatives whenever possible by entering into international swaps and derivatives association isda master agreements with certain counterparties these agreements contain various provisions including but not limited to collateral requirements events of default or early termination termination events applicable to the counterparty include certain deteriorations in the credit quality of the counterparty termination events applicable to the fund include failure of the fund to maintain certain net asset levels andor limit the decline in net assets over various periods of time in the event of default or early termination the isda master agreement gives the nondefaulting party the right to net and closeout all transactions traded whether or not arising under the isda agreement to one net amount payable by one counterparty to the other early termination by the counterparty may result in an immediate payment by the fund of any net liability owed to that counterparty under the isda agreement   collateral requirements differ by type of derivative collateral terms are contract specific for otc derivatives for otc derivatives traded under an isda master agreement posting of collateral is required by either the fund or the applicable counterparty if the total net exposure of all otc derivatives with the applicable counterparty exceeds the minimum transfer amount which typically ranges from  to  and can vary depending on the counterparty and the type of the agreement generally collateral is determined at the close of fund business each day and any additional collateral required due to changes in derivative values may be delivered by the fund or the counterparty within a few business days collateral pledged andor received by the fund if any is held in segregated accounts with the funds custodiancounterparty broker and can be in the form of cash andor securities unrestricted cash may be invested according to the funds investment objectives the fund entered into otc forward exchange contracts primarily to manage andor gain exposure to certain foreign currencies a forward exchange contract is an agreement between the fund and a counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange rate on a future date the fund entered into credit default swap contracts primarily to manage exposure to credit risk a credit default swap is an agreement between the fund and a counterparty whereby the buyer of the contract receives credit protection and the seller of the contract guarantees the credit worthiness of a referenced debt obligation these agreements may be privately negotiated in the overthecounter market otc credit default swaps or may be executed in a multilateral trade facility platform such as a registered exchange centrally cleared credit default swaps the underlying referenced debt obligation may be a single issuer of corporate or sovereign debt a credit index or a tranche of a credit index in the event of a default of the underlying referenced debt obligation the buyer is entitled to receive the notional amount of the credit default swap contract from the seller in exchange for the referenced debt obligation a net settlement amount equal to the notional amount of the credit default swap less the recovery value of the referenced debt obligation or other agreed upon amount for centrally cleared credit default swaps required initial margin deposits of cash or securities are pledged by the fund subsequent payments known as variation margin are made or received by the fund depending on fluctuations in the value of the underlying referenced debt obligation such variation margin is accounted for as unrealized appreciation or depreciation until the contract is closed at which time the gains or losses are realized over the term of the contract the buyer pays the seller a periodic stream of payments provided that no event of default has occurred such periodic payments are accrued daily as an unrealized appreciation or depreciation until the payments are made at which time they are realized payments received or paid to initiate a credit default swap contract represent compensating factors between stated terms of the credit default swap agreement and prevailing market conditions credit spreads and other relevant factors these upfront payments are amortized over the term of the contract as a realized gain or loss the fund did not hold any credit default swap contracts at period end  income taxes at august    the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation depreciation for income tax purposes were as follows    fair value measurements the fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and the funds own market assumptions unobservable inputs these inputs are used in determining the value of the funds financial instruments and are summarized in the following fair value hierarchy level   quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments level   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar financial instruments interest rates prepayment speed credit risk etc level   significant unobservable inputs including the funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of financial instruments the inputs or methodology used for valuing financial instruments are not an indication of the risk associated with investing in those financial instruments for movements between the levels within the fair value hierarchy the fund has adopted a policy of recognizing the transfers as of the date of the underlying event which caused the movement a summary of inputs used as of august   in valuing the funds assets and liabilities carried at fair value is as follows a includes common preferred and convertible preferred stocks b includes securities determined to have no value at august   a reconciliation of assets in which level  inputs are used in determining fair value is presented when there are significant level  investments at the end of the period  subsequent events the fund has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of the statement of investments and determined that no events have occurred that require disclosure for additional information on the funds significant accounting policies please refer to the funds most recent semiannual

franklin universal trust franklin custodian funds inc franklin templeton variable insurance products trust franklin multi income trust and franklin strategic series plaintiffs againstapp global ltd et al defendants  herman cahn j as a preliminary matter the court has raised the issue of whether plaintiffs attorneys should be disqualified from also representing thirdparty defendants code of professional responsibility dr   nycrr § fn plaintiffsinvestment funds the franklin funds brought this action alleging losses caused by misrepresentations of defendants the issuers of securities in which plaintiffs invested defendants thereafter brought the thirdparty action against the third party defendants franklin funds investment advisers the franklin fund advisers for contribution defendants allege inter alia that the franklin fund advisers were negligent in their overall management of the funds and thereby contributed to the franklin funds losses based on these allegations the third party plaintiffs seek contribution from franklin fund advisers during a conference on june   the court was informed that counsel representing franklin funds herein had also been retained by the franklin fund advisers to undertake their defense of the thirdparty action the court thereupon raised the issue of a possible conflict caused by the simultaneous representation of plaintiffs and thirdparty defendants and sought submissions from the parties on this point upon deliberation the court issues the following decision and order simultaneous representation of differing interests in litigation is prohibited unless a disinterested lawyer would believe that the lawyer can competently represent the interest of each and if each consents to the representation after full disclosure of the implications of the simultaneous representation and the advantages and risks involved dr  ac because dual representation is fraught with the potential for irreconcilable conflict it will rarely be sanctioned even after full disclosure has been had and the consent of the parties obtained greene v greene  nyd    with rare and conditional exceptions the lawyer may not place himself in a position where a conflicting interest may even inadvertently affect or give the appearance of affecting the obligations of the professional relationship matter of kelly  nyd    doubts as to the existence of a conflict of interest must be resolved in favor of disqualification heelan v lockwood  add   d dept  the franklin funds have no independent paid employees as evidenced by the form k filed by franklin resources inc with the securities and exchange commission hine aff ex a at  rather plaintiffsfranklin funds are managed by distinct affiliates thirdparty defendantsfranklin advisers id ex b at   underlying the thirdparty complaints claim for contribution is the allegation that the franklin advisers breached their managerial duties to the franklin funds by favoring other investment funds and providing reckless advice causing some of the economic injuries which the actioninchief seeks to recoup from defendants thirdparty complaint ¶¶  if this claim is proven the franklin funds may possess an independent cause of action against franklin advisers arising out of managerial neglect thus the franklin funds and the franklin advisers represent potentially differing interests of the type which the disciplinary rule cautions against in terms of simultaneous representation by counsel dr  a b a disinterested lawyer or judge would have doubts as to the ability of plaintiffs counsel to completely represent both interests plaintiffs counsels simultaneous representation of thirdparty defendants has the dangerous potential of compromising viable claims which the franklin funds may or may not have against the franklin advisors for example if there are settlement negotiations franklin funds counsel will be expected to press for the maximum recovery for plaintiffs franklin advisers on the other hand may be in favor of a lesser recovery if it included a release of the third party claims such a possible conflict compromises the ability of the attorney to properly represent both parties at a bare minimum the franklin funds and the franklin advisers have differing if not opposing interests by virtue of the claims asserted in the thirdparty complaint see also boyd v trent  add  d dept  attorney disqualified from representing vehicle owner and passenger due to the possibility of an independent claim by the passenger against the owner appeal dismissed  nyd   wood v beacon factors corp  add  d dept  attorney disqualified from representing multiple shareholders of a close corporation due to the possibility of crossclaims among the shareholders plaintiffs counsel submits what purport to be three consents to representation and waivers of conflict dated may   postdating their appearance seemingly on behalf of thirdparty defendants banko aff exs ce all three were executed by richard l kuersteiner who identifies himself as assistant vice president of the franklin funds and associate general counsel of franklin advisers id moreover even if kuersteiner demonstrated that he could in a general sense act on behalf of the franklin funds he may not possess that capacity in this instance given his simultaneous affiliation with the franklin advisers as their associate general counsel see rice v baron  f supp   sd ny  rejecting consents to simultaneous representation on the ground that there is no indication of any participation by noninterested directors in the execution of those corporate consents     finally even if a proper representative of the franklin funds executed the consents be it kuersteiner or otherwise this appears to be a case where the potential conflict is simply not waivable as the court of appeals states where a lawyer represents parties whose interests conflict as to the particular subject matter the likelihood of prejudice to one party may be so great that misconduct will be found despite disclosure and consent matter of kelly supra at  the court rejects plaintiffs counsels suggestion that a favorable disposition of thirdparty defendants pending motion to dismiss would obviate the need to address the issue of disqualification the grant of such a motion might well lead to an appeal which would again require the third party defendant to be represented by counsel accordingly it is ordered that kostelanetz  fink llp and grant  eisenhofer pa plaintiffs counsel are disqualified from representing thirdparty defendants in this action and it is further ordered that thirdparty defendants motion to dismiss seq no  is denied without prejudice to renew upon their retention of new counsel and it is further ordered that thirdparty defendants are afforded until the next conference date august   at  am to retain new counsel datedjune   e n t e r  s j s c  footnotes footnote this decision and order

fluctuate with market conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares footnotes a statistical measurement of the range of a funds total returns in general a higher standard deviation means greater volatility based on the funds monthly returns over the year period ended as of the date of the calculation a statistical measurement of a funds historical riskadjusted performance it is calculated by taking a funds excess return over that of the threemonth treasury bill divided by its standard deviation higher values generally indicate better historical riskadjusted performance based on the  years ended as of the date of the calculation the annualized percentage difference between a funds actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk

the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the
