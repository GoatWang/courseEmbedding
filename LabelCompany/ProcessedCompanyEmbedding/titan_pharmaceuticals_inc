technology overview proneura offers continuous drug delivery and consists of a small solid rod made from a mixture of ethylenevinyl acetate eva and a drug substance the resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period this continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to  to  months making products with proneura the drug substance that is part of the proneura implant is released slowly into the patients body at continuous levels through the process of dissolution this results in a stable level of medication in the blood similar to intravenous administration such longterm linear release characteristics are generally desirable as this avoids peakandtrough level

use compliance treatment with the proneura™ implant is expected to enhance patient compliance safety nonfluctuating drug exposure over six months may provide superior safety and tolerability ease of use patients are dosed once every six months in an outpatient setting overview of opioid addiction what is opioid addiction opioid addiction is a medical condition that is increasingly recognized as a global epidemic by world health authorities addiction is a primary chronic disease of brain reward motivation memory and neurobiological circuitry it is characterized by cravings accompanied by a lack of impulse control as well as cycles of relapse and remission if left untreated addiction is a progressive disease that often results in disability or premature death current treatments opioid addiction requires longterm treatment plans and medical care abstinence is rarely a successful therapeutic approach the current gold standard for medication assisted therapy mat in the us is buprenorphine while sublingual buprenorphine is widely used as a treatment for opioid addiction there are challenges with this option including patient compliance dosing that results in variable medication levels and diversion and abuse associated with current daily medications given the significant health epidemic of opioid addiction in the us federal officials are seeking ways to ensure greater access to safe and effective treatments for the disease while minimizing the risk of diversion and abuse the us health and human services hhs department recently announced that it will move to expand access to mat by revising the regulations related to the prescribing of buprenorphine to treat opioid dependence the current cap on the number of patients that can be treated with buprenorphine products by a physician limits the availability of this important medication assisted therapy the hhs revision to the regulation will provide a balance between expanding the supply of buprenorphinebased treatment encouraging use of evidencebased mat and minimizing the risk of drug diversion treatment options that minimize the risk of abuse and diversion such as titans probuphine implant could increasingly play a crucial role in the maintenance treatment of patients suffering from opioid addiction opioid dependence market need buprenorphine dominates the current opioid addiction market b us sales of daily oral formulations of buprenorphine  since  us buprenorphine prescriptions have exceeded those of methadone challenges with oral buprenorphine that probuphine can overcome patient compliance currently used sublingual dosing results in variable levels of medication in blood diversion and abuse associated with current daily dosed formulations clinical studies a final phase  doubleblind double dummy clinical study of  patients met the prespecified endpoint of noninferiority as well as all secondary endpoints data from that trial also indicate that patients who were clinically stable on mg or less of buprenorphine per day maintained stability when transferred to probuphine and were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than those being treated with sublingual buprenorphine prior to the final phase  trial the efficacy and safety of probuphine were studied in several other clinical trials including a patient placebocontrolled study over a week period published in the journal of the american medical association jama and a follow on study of  patients published in the journal addiction the proneura longterm

state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy andor safety benefit probuphiner our first product candidate based on the proneura platform was approved by the fda in may  for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who are stable on low to moderate doses of daily sublingual buprenorphine treatment we have licensed development and commercialization rights of probuphine for the us and canadian markets to braeburn and pursuant to the license agreement as amended to date we received a  million milestone payment upon fda approval of the probuphine nda and are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of probuphine ranging in percentage from the midteens to the low twenties based on a tiered structure the agreement also provides for up to an additional  million in sales milestones and  million in regulatory milestones on probuphine additionally in certain circumstances the agreement entitles us to a low single digit royalty up to an aggregate of  million on net sales by braeburn if any of other future competing products in the addiction market eg a monthly depot injection braeburn commenced commercialization activities in support of the probuphine product launch shortly after fda approval during the second half of  braeburn was engaged in training qualified health care providers in the implant insertion and removal procedures physician outreach payment and reimbursement discussions with third party payors and sales and marketing efforts associated with the launch including hiring personnel for a field sales force in january  braeburn indicated that more than  health care providers from all  states and puerto rico were certified to provide probuphine to their patients and more than  payors including private insurers the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms and veterans administration programs covered probuphine also the permanent jcode for probuphine as the first sixmonth buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid addiction became effective on january   and we were informed that it should be incorporated into the reimbursement processing systems of most third party payor plans by early to midsecond quarter  with a field sales force and medical support staff of more than  in place by early first quarter  braeburn commenced a full commercial launch focused on more than  key treatment centers throughout the us to establish sites of excellence for the longterm maintenance treatment with probuphine as with the launch of any new method of medical treatment in the current reimbursement environment progress is slow during the initial several months while the challenges of the third party payor system are addressed braeburn has devoted substantial resources to support the patient and the physician community to facilitate this process of getting prior approvals from third party payors for treatment with probuphine while they have indicated good progress with some payors it remains a challenge with some and recently braeburn expanded its distribution channels and processing capacity by adding a second specialty pharmacy company to increase coverage across the country during the first quarter the number of patients seeking treatment with probuphine showed a steady growth from month to month and at the same time the number of health care providers that have prescribed probuphine has been increasing from week to week while revenues to titan from probuphine have to date been limited the patient and physician trends are encouraging and we believe braeburn is establishing a strong foundation for future success we have been advised that most patients completing the first six month treatment with probuphine during the quarter opted for treatment continuation we believe we will benefit from the trend of opioid addiction treatments move towards extended release formulations a trend evidenced by the development efforts of the major suppliers of daily dosed buprenorphine products aimed at adding extended release formulations to their product pipeline however in light of the difficulties encountered to date we cannot predict either the timing or the degree to which probuphine will be accepted by the medical community we have continued to make progress in the efforts to advance potential commercialization of probuphine outside of the us and canada to obtain regulatory clarity for product approval in europe we met in december  with the uk and german regulatory agencies and based on feedback from these meetings we submitted an application to the european medicines agency or ema seeking eligibility for probuphine to follow the centralized review and approval process for its marketing authorization application or maa in early march  we received confirmation from the ema that probuphine is eligible for a centralized review and approval process we were recently informed by the ema that a pediatric indication waiver has been granted while we are still early in this process it is our estimate that an maa could be filed in the fourth quarter of  we have also been granted small manufacturing entity or sme status in europe which provides for some monetary benefits during the application process and commercialization we have continued the interactions regarding potential partnerships for probuphine in europe and elsewhere and this regulatory clarity has helped in advancing the dialogue we believe that our proneura long term drug delivery platform has the potential to be used in the treatment of other chronic conditions where maintaining stable around the clock blood levels of a medication may benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes we have two products in early development using the proneura platform an implant designed to provide longterm delivery of ropinirole a dopamine agonist approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of parkinsons disease and an implant designed to provide longterm delivery of t a synthetic thyroid hormone approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of hypothyroidism the nonclinical development work related to the ropinirole implant including the toxicology studies was completed in the fourth quarter of  and the ind was submitted to the fda in january  in late february  in a telephone conversation we received comments from the fda following its initial review of the ind requesting additional information related to final test results for the ropinirole implant and the applicator as well as the name of the principal investigator and we were asked to hold the initiation of the clinical study we received the fdas written comments in late march giving details of the requested information we are working as quickly as possible to provide the fda with the additional information and expect to have during june all the data needed for the fda submission we hope to be able to commence the clinical study in early third quarter although there is no assurance that the fda will clear the ind within that timeframe if at all during  we identified refinements to the t implant formulation however due to shortage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or api further investigation had to be temporarily suspended during the fourth quarter of  in early  we obtained the requisite supply of the api and have commenced work towards the optimization of the t implant we intend to have further discussions this quarter with experts on the clinical development pathway and the timing of further development activities will be dependent on those discussions and the availability of additional financial resources our goal is to further expand the product pipeline and we are currently evaluating other drugs and disease settings for opportunities to use the proneura platform in potential treatment applications where conventional treatment is limited by variability in blood drug levels and poor patient compliance we

 item  of this quarterly report on form q for information on recent accounting pronouncements results of operations for the three months ended march   and march   license revenues were approximately  during the three months ended march   compared with no license revenue during the three months ended march   license revenue for the  period reflects the recognition of royalties earned on net sales of our probuphine product by braeburn research and development expenses for the three month period ended march   were approximately  million compared to approximately  million for the comparable period in  an increase of approximately  million or  the increase in research and development costs was primarily associated with increases in external research and development expenses related to the support of our probuphine and proneura product development programs and other research and development expenses during the three month period ended march   external research and development expenses relating to our product development programs were approximately  million compared to approximately  million for the comparable period in  other research and development expenses include internal operating costs such as clinical research and development personnelrelated expenses clinical trials related travel expenses and allocation of facility and corporate costs as a result of the risks and uncertainties inherently associated with pharmaceutical research and development activities described elsewhere in this report we are unable to estimate the specific timing and future costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows if any from our product candidates general and administrative expenses for the three month period ended march   were approximately  million compared to approximately  million for the comparable period in  an increase of approximately  million or  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increases in noncash stockbased compensation and employeerelated costs of approximately  million and professional fees of approximately  million net other income for the three month period ended march   was approximately  million compared to net other expense of approximately  for the comparable period in  net other income for the three month period ended march   consisted primarily of noncash

securities and the issuance of debt as well as with proceeds from warrant and option exercises corporate licensing and collaborative agreements and governmentsponsored research grants at march   we had working capital of approximately  million compared to working capital of approximately  million at december   our operating activities used approximately  million during the three months ended march   this consisted primarily of the net loss for the period of approximately  million  million related to noncash gains on changes in the fair value of warrants and  million related to net changes in other operating assets and liabilities this was offset in part by noncash charges of approximately  million related to stockbased compensation and approximately  million related to depreciation and amortization uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund product development programs and administrative expenses our investing activities used approximately  during the three months ended march   which was primarily related to purchases of equipment we had no financing activities during the three months ended march   at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  million which we believe are sufficient to fund our planned operations through the second quarter of  we will require additional funds either through payments from braeburn under the license agreement or through other financing arrangements to advance our current proneura development programs beyond the planned activities for the next  months and to complete the regulatory approval process

approves first buprenorphine implant for treatment of opioid dependence                                                expanded use and availability of medicationassisted treatment is a top priority of federal effort to combat opioid epidemic                                                                                                                                                                                                           probuphine healthcare provider locator     the us food and drug administration today approved probuphine the first buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence probuphine is designed to provide a constant lowlevel dose of buprenorphine for six months in patients who are already stable on lowtomoderate doses of other forms of buprenorphine as part of a complete treatment program until today buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence was only approved as a pill or a film placed under the tongue or on the inside of a person’s cheek until it dissolved while effective a pill or film may be lost forgotten or stolen however as an implant probuphine provides a new treatment option for people in recovery who may value the unique benefits of a sixmonth implant compared to other forms of buprenorphine such as the possibility of improved patient convenience from not needing to take medication on a daily basis an independent fda advisory committee supported the approval of probuphine in a meeting held earlier this year opioid abuse and addiction have taken a devastating toll on american families we must do everything we can to make new innovative treatment options available that can help patients regain control over their lives” said fda commissioner robert m califf md “today’s approval provides the firstever implantable option to support patients’ efforts to maintain treatment as part of their overall recovery program” expanding the use and availability of medicationassisted treatment mat options like buprenorphine is an important component of the fda’s opioid action plan and one of three top priorities for the us department of health and human services’ opioid initiative aimed at reducing prescription opioid and heroin related overdose death and dependence opioid dependence is the diagnostic term used for the more common concept “addiction” in the probuphine clinical trials addiction is defined as a cluster of behavioral cognitive and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug difficulties in controlling drug use persisting in drug use despite harmful consequences a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations as well as the possibility of the development of tolerance or development of physical dependence physical dependence is not the same as addiction newer diagnostic terminology uses the term “opioid use disorder” which includes both milder forms of problematic opioid use as well as addiction mat is a comprehensive approach that combines approved medications currently methadone buprenorphine or naltrexone with counseling and other behavioral therapies to treat patients with opioid use disorder regular adherence to mat with buprenorphine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms and the desire to use without causing the cycle of highs and lows associated with opioid misuse or abuse at sufficient doses it also decreases the pleasurable effects of other opioids making continued opioid abuse less attractive according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration patients receiving mat for their opioid use disorder cut their risk of death from all causes in half “scientific evidence suggests that maintenance treatment with these medications in the context of behavioral treatment and recovery support are more effective in the treatment of opioid use disorder than shortterm detoxification programs aimed at abstinence” said nora volkow md director of the national institute on drug abuse at the national institutes of health “this product will expand the treatment alternatives available to people suffering from an opioid use disorder” probuphine should be used as part of a complete treatment program that includes counseling and psychosocial support probuphine consists of four oneinchlong rods that are implanted under the skin on the inside of the upper arm and provide treatment for six months administering probuphine requires specific training because it must be surgically inserted and removed only a health care provider who has completed the training and become certified through a restricted program called the probuphine risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems program should insert and remove the implants if further treatment is needed new implants may be inserted in the opposite arm for one additional course of treatment the fda is requiring postmarketing studies to establish the safety and feasibility of placing the probuphine implants for additional courses of treatment the safety and efficacy of probuphine were demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial of adults who met the clinical criteria for opioid dependence and were considered stable after prior buprenorphine treatment a response to mat was measured by urine screening and selfreporting of illicit opioid use during the six month treatment period sixtythree percent of probuphinetreated patients had no evidence of illicit opioid use throughout the six months of treatment – similar to the  percent of those who responded to sublingual under the tongue buprenorphine alone the most common side effects from treatment with probuphine include implantsite pain itching and redness as well as headache depression constipation nausea vomiting back pain toothache and oropharyngeal pain the safety and efficacy of probuphine have not been established in children or adolescents less than  years of age clinical studies of probuphine did not include participants over the age of  probuphine has a boxed warning that provides important safety information for health care professionals including a warning that insertion and removal of probuphine are associated with the risk of implant migration protrusion expulsion and nerve damage resulting from the procedure probuphine must be prescribed and dispensed according to the probuphine rems program because of the risks of surgical complications and because of the risks of accidental overdose misuse and abuse if an implant comes out or protrudes from the skin as part of this program probuphine can only be prescribed and dispensed by health care providers who are certified with the rems program and have completed live training among other requirements probuphine implants contain a significant amount of drug that can potentially be expelled or removed resulting in the potential for accidental exposure or intentional misuse and abuse if the implant comes out of the skin patients should be seen during the first week after insertion and a visit schedule of no less than oncemonthly is recommended for continued counseling and psychosocial support probuphine is

studies completed to date with final phase  study under way  initial small dose finding study    two wellcontrolled phase  safety and efficacy studies showing clinical and statistical superiority over placebo and noninferiority to suboxone published in journal of american medical association and addiction    two openlabel longterm treatment safety studies  relative bioavailability study   study results mildtomoderate adverse events typical of the safety profile of buprenorphine low number of serious adverse events similar to placebo welltolerated implant procedure no evidence of implant diversion or misuse key benefits efficacy effective in reducing illicit opioid use compliance treatment with the proneura™ implant is expected to enhance patient compliance safety nonfluctuating drug exposure over six months may provide superior safety and tolerability ease of use patients are dosed once every six months in an outpatient setting   proneura™ titans proprietary longterm drug delivery platform provides continuous drug release and nonfluctuating medication levels over a period of three months to a year depending on drug characteristics proneura products are subdermal implants that are ideal for treating chronic diseases for which the maintenance of stable medication levels could offer advantages over other routes of administration home technology    overview     proneura offers continuous drug delivery and consists of a small solid rod made from a mixture of ethylenevinyl acetate “eva” and a drug substance                                                        the resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure and is      removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period         this continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an      outpatient basis over extended periods of up to  to  months         continuous drug delivery technology     the continuous drug delivery system consists of a small solid rod made from a mixture of ethylenevinyl acetate “eva” and a drug substance the resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period the drug substance is released slowly at continuous levels through the process of dissolution this results in a stable blood level similar to intravenous administration such longterm linear release characteristics are generally desirable as this avoids peak and trough level dosing that poses problems for many central nervous system “cns” and other disease settings  this continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to  months in addition to probuphine which is the first product to complete clinical testing that has utilized this proprietary continuous drug delivery technology titan has conducted initial nonclinical studies with longterm delivery of dopamine agonists demonstrating the potential of this product in the treatment of parkinson’s disease in nonclinical models of the disease     company overview   titan pharmaceuticals inc is a biopharmaceutical company developing proprietary therapeutics primarily for the treatment of serious medical disorders titan’s principal asset is probuphine® the first slowrelease implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride “buprenorphine” designed to maintain a stable roundtheclock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment the outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a  billion market in the us and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the us in  this novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations an fdarequested phase  study is currently in progress with completion expected in mid and resubmission of the new drug application later in  in december  titan entered into a license agreement with braeburn pharmaceuticals sprl “braeburn” that grants braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to probuphine® in the united states and canada titan received a nonrefundable upfront license fee of  million and will receive a  million milestone payment upon the approval of the nda by the fda additionally titan will be eligible to receive up to  million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to  million in regulatory milestones in the event of future nda submissions and approvals for additional indications including chronic pain titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of probuphine ranging from the midteens to the low twenties probuphine is the first product to utilize proneura™ a novel proprietary longterm drug delivery technology the proneura technology has the potential to be used in developing products for the treatment of other chronic conditions such as parkinson’s disease where maintaining stable roundtheclock blood levels of a drug can benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes finally titan has monetized substantially all of the future royalty revenue of  of net sales of fanapt® iloperidone an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the us for the treatment of schizophrenia by novartis pharma ag “novartis” the future royalty revenue has been sold to deerfield management “deerfield” a healthcare investment fund in exchange for cash and debt considerations which have been used to advance the development of probuphine and for general corporate purposes     management team president
