investigated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als aisa complete chronic spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke our technology enables the isolation and largescale expansion of regionally specific human neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord this enables the generation of physiologically relevant human neurons of all types we believe that our stem cell technology will assist the body in producing new cells to replace malfunctioning or dead cells as a way to treat disease and injury many significant and currently untreatable human diseases arise from the loss or malfunction of specific cell types in the body our stem cells may provide an effective method to protect such cell types and in certain cases to generate replacement cells from neural stem cells we believe that protecting the healthy cells or replacing damaged malfunctioning or dead neural cells with fully functional ones may be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating many diseases and conditions of the nervous system view candidate nsi  neuralstem inc cur pipeline nsi candidate  indication preclinical phase  phase  phase  cell therapy nsi us amyotropic

corporate strategy is to seek partnershipscollaborations to fund the programs about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement als is an orphan condition in the us and eu and approximately  people in the us are diagnosed with the condition each year the incidence of als is two per  people and it is estimated that more than  americans may be living with als at any given time in als nerve cells neurons waste away or die and can no longer send messages to muscles this eventually leads to muscle weakening twitching and an inability to move the arms legs and body the condition slowly gets worse when the muscles in the chest area stop working it becomes hard or impossible to breathe nsi as a potential treatment nsi is under development as a potential treatment for als by providing cells designed to nurture and protect the patients remaining motor neurons and possibly repair some motor neurons which have not yet died but which are diseased neuralstem received orphan designation by the fda for nsi in als nsi was evaluated in phase  and phase  safety studies in  patients the data showed that the intraspinal transplantation of the cells was safe and well tolerated subjects from both the phase  and phase  continue to be monitored for longterm followup evaluations to date substantially all the clinical costs of our als studies have been funded by grants about chronic spinal cord injury a spinal cord injury or sci generally refers to any injury to the spinal cord that is caused by trauma instead of disease although in some cases it can be the result of diseases it is estimated that there are  new cases of sci per year and that at any given time there are between  and  people in the united states that are living with sci chronic spinal cord injury generally refers to the phase beginning  months after the initial injury scis are most often traumatic caused by lateral bending dislocation rotation axial loading and hyperflexion or hyperextension of the cord or cauda equina motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of scis while other causes include falls workrelated accidents sports injuries and penetrations such as stab or gunshot wounds in certain instances scis can also be of a nontraumatic origin as in the case of cancer infection intervertebral disc disease vertebral injury and spinal cord vascular disease nsi as a potential treatment we believe that nsi may provide an effective treatment for chronic spinal cord injury by bridging the gap in the spinal cord circuitry created in traumatic spinal cord injury and providing new cells to help transmit the signal from the brain to points at or below the point of injury we are carrying out a phase  trial to test this possibility the study has enrolled four aisa thoracic spinal cord injury subjects motor and sensory complete one to two years postinjury at the time of stem cell treatment in a phase  safety study the stem cell treatment was found to be safe and welltolerated by the subjects enrolled and there were no serious adverse events at sixmonth post transplantation subjects are currently being monitored for longterm followup evaluations the fda has approved the protocol amendment to treat an additional cohort of four cervical spinal cord injury patients substantially all of the clinical costs of this study have been and will continue to be funded by grants arranged through ucsd about ischemic stroke ischemic strokes the most common type of stroke occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain approximately  million people worldwide suffer stroke of which it is estimated that  of all strokes are ischemic strokes poststroke motor deficits include paralysis in arms and legs and can be permanent nsi as a potential treatment we believe that nsi may provide an effective treatment for restoring motor deficits resulting from ischemic stroke by both creating new circuitry in the area of injury and through repairing and or nurturing diseased cells to improve function in patients currently neuralstem is conducting a phase  safety trial in  subjects with motor deficits due to ischemic stroke the trial is being conducted at bayi brain hospital in beijing china subjects are currently being monitored through their month observational followup period the trial is being conducted by suzhou neuralstem a wholly owned subsidiary of neuralstem in china contact  neuralstem inc cur contact

characterized by episodes of allencompassing low mood accompanied by low selfesteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities mdd is the leading cause of disability in the us for persons age  to  in  an estimated  million adults aged  or older in the us had at least one major depressive episode in the prior year this number represented  of all us adults treatment of mdd is characterized by a high level of patient turnover due to low efficacy and high side effects it is estimated that  of patients will fail their first line therapy  will then fail their second line prescription and  will then fail their third line prescription these factors combine to create a significant opportunity for a differentiated therapeutic agent particularly one that may act through a novel mechanism of action with few side effects  httpswwwnimhnihgovhealthstatisticsprevalencemajordepressionamongadultsshtml accessed february   rush aj fava m et al stard investigators groupsequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression stard rationale and design control clin trials  feb nsi as a potential treatment for mdd nsi is being developed for the treatment of major depressive disorder mdd and other psychiatric andor cognitive impairment indications associated with hippocampal atrophy nsi is the lead compound in our neurogenic small molecule drug discovery program we believe that nsi which increases neurogenesis and hippocampal volume may provide an effective treatment for patients suffering from mdd by promoting synaptogenesis or neurogenesis in the hippocampus nsi stimulates neurogenesis of human hippocampus derived neural stem cells in vitro and stimulates neurogenesis in young normal healthy mouse hippocampus in vivo the neurogenic effect by nsi is believed to have a highly specific effect in the hippocampus and subventricular zone the two wellknown neurogenic regions in adult cns and nowhere else in the cns preclinical insight into nsi  potential for broad utility potential treatment for cognitive impairment and angelman syndrome treatment of normal mouse brain slices with nsi produced a concentration and time dependent enhancement of the magnitude of long term potentiation ltp a measure of synaptic plasticity which is an in vitro biomarker of memory additionally nsiinduced ltp enhancement requires protein synthesis suggesting structural synaptic plasticity nsi treatment of brain slices from mice with a genetic defect that models angelman syndrome which in humans leads to inherited intellectual disability restored ltp to normal levels nsi treatment ameliorated behavioral and memory function and preserved hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of cognitive impairment induced by irradiation potential treatment for type  and type  diabetes nsi was demonstrated to be effective in the prevention and reversal of peripheral neuropathies in a mouse model of type  and preventative in a mouse model of type  diabetes data from these studies which includes reversal of neuropathic pain and decreased nerve conductance associated with the onset of diabetic symptoms suggest that nsi may have broad applicability in the treatment of central and peripheral neuropathies arising from diverse etiologies potential treatment for ischemic stroke oral administration of nsi to mice with ischemic stroke led to a significant increase in neurogenesis in the hippocampus accompanied by a significant recovery from motor deficit this evidence suggests that nsi can induce recovery from strokeinduced brain damage the improvements were maintained post the termination of nsi therapy for an additional week drugfree observational period the sustained improvement suggests that nsi initiated a host brain repair mechanism enabling tissue remodeling of the stroke brain nsi demonstrated the upregulation of growth factors such as stem cell factor scf and brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf as well as
