a lifetime after raising over  and completing many community service projects laura and a group of other likeminded young people in an organization called bike and build left from yorktown virginia on bicycles with hopes of reaching the pacific ocean stopping along the way to build houses for habitat for humanity laura and her team were lucky enough to travel across many different states and see some amazing sights all while raising awareness for the need for affordable housing in america laura made it two months into her trip before tragedy struck in idaho falls idaho  on july th just  weeks from reaching the pacific laura and another rider were struck from behind by a car going  mph by the grace of god a cardiologist and several nurses were nearby and were able to help the girls within minutes both were rushed to the nearest trauma center for care tragically lauras friend and fellow cyclist anne davis  did not survive her injuries   currently laura is in the icu at eastern idaho regional medical center she has sustained a serious spinal injury has many broken bones and is currently on a ventilator to help her breathe at this point it is unclear what the lasting damage of this collision will be including whether or not she will walk again she has a long road to recovery ahead of her including weeks in idaho in the hospital several surgeries and physical therapy while there is still much unknown laura has a fantastic medical team working for her some of her family has made the trip from michigan and virginia to stay with her however “team laura” needs your help  many people have asked how they can help and show compassion we are asking for monetary donations to help relieve some stress of laura and her family during this terrible time of uncertainty the financial burden will no doubt be heavy for laura and the whole stark family it is unknown what exactly laura will need in the near future but due to the significance of her injuries we know that laura will come across many expenses relating to her health and accommodations she will also need help paying existing and future bills funds will also be used to help alleviate some of the considerable costs incurred by her family as we hope to be able to keep at least one family member near lauras side as she endures the difficult process of recovery we will not let her be alone  miles from home   laura

friends sorry it’s been so long since i’ve officially updated you all about my progress the last month has been just that progress i was released from the hospital midseptember and flew home on the world’s smallest plane i flew home with angel medical flight and they were so great to me a huge thank you goes to them for the quick smooth flight back to jackson and being so attentive to me i basically slept the whole time so it must’ve been good it was such a bittersweet day i was heartbroken for having to say goodbye to my therapists nurses doctors etc that had become some of my closest friends they were the only people i knew in idaho and quickly became my confidants and biggest cheerleaders during recovery i think i was most nervous about leaving the people i had trusted so much and relied upon during my stay luckily my dad had been in idaho through it all so he now knows more than just about anyone i am so thankful he was there to take over their roles because without him i would be so lost on the other hand i was getting back to normalcy it was great to get back to michigan where my friends would be able to visit and my hair straightener would be ready to use not kidding my hair has been my truest struggle the past month home has flown by it’s been full of a lot of adjusting and a lot of learning it was really weird being paralyzed in a new environment since the accident i hadn’t been out of the hospital for more than a few hours so this month has been full of rediscovering my independence the first couple days were the hardest i had questioned myself a lot on whether or not i could actually do this being paralyzed is hard real hard i don’t think i ever imagined just how difficult it would be every single thing i do calls for much more effort than before getting ready for the day takes  hours at best and that is exhausting enough those first couple days were full of figuring out my routine figuring out what i still needed and figuring out what i could actually do to say it was an easy transition would be a lie it was rough but every day my dad and i would talk about how this day was easier than yesterday and call it a success every day has been much better than the previous since then we finally have a routine down and know what to expect for the most part it’s much easier living with paralysis now and each day is thankfully pretty predictable my favorite part of the week is when i get to go to physical and occupational therapy i go three times a week for about  hrs each time its nice to get out of the house but i thoroughly enjoy the work ive already learned so much in the few weeks ive been going i can get around better pull myself into bed easier and pick things up off the ground without tipping over we also work a lot on upper body strength training which makes everything easier my upper body used to be so weak but now i rely on those muscles for everything ive improved so much in the last couple months and i definitely couldnt have imagined that id be doing this well i just want to thank everyone whos been helping me through the past  months ive been so blessed by all of the support prayers donations and cards ive realized i have so many people that love and care for my family and i we have been so amazed by all of the help and support weve gotten and continue to receive we thank god constantly for all he had done laura  switching twins sarah here  in my first gofundme update three months ago i wrote about the day when i turned on music in the icu and laura started tapping her fingers along to the beat of sleep on the floor by the lumineers i cried a lot that day sad tears angry tears totally exhausted tears the uncertainties were just so numerous and so terrifying i was just so completely overwhelmed and felt so helpless a couple weeks ago laura and i went to the lumineers concert it was quite the process even getting there but we ended up having a lot of fun the band opened the show with sleep on the floor and surprise more tears however these were no longer sad tears angry tears exhausted tears these were purely  happy tears the uncertainties are still there but i got to be at a concert with my sister three months ago that was an uncertainty the amount of progress laura has made since july is just amazing she’s been out to prove everyone wrong since the day she was born why stop now please continue to pray for laura my dad and my family like i said the uncertainties are still very much there it’s been a slow road to recovery and it’ll continue on for quite some time but we have faith that this road exists for a reason there will be good days and bad days but god has not let us down yet xoxsarah i want to repost anne’s memorial page  httpclassicbikeandbuildorgrider and her gofundme page  httpswwwgofundmecomgnuhp this tragedy affected so many people but no one as much as her parents and brother we send love and pray for the davis family daily and we think of anne constantly my idaho familythe lumineers concertmade it back in time for sarahs wedding  read more update  posted by sarah stark  months ago    share  hey friends laura here with my first official update ive been doing so much better since the last update and everything is becoming a little more routine i usually have two sessions of therapy in the morning and two sessions in the afternoon those tend to be separated by a couple of doctor visits wound care and most importantly lunch my obligations for the day are usually done by late afternoon leaving me absolutely exhausted i havent had a nap in  days so life is getting a little rough here in idaho everyday tasks that used to take no thought at all have taken me weeks to remaster it now only takes me about  minutes to get dressed and i dont even have to worry about my outfit so im pretty impressed with myself there right now im working on transferring myself to a wheelchair without any assistance and im soooo close today was my best day yet so im pretty excited to see what tomorrow will bring i can definitely tell i am getting stronger and for that i am so thankful when i first started therapy my arms were practically useless so its nice to be able to finally rely on them my blood pressure has finally been relatively cooperative so ive been able to do so much more my favorite two things ive been able to do are take a real shower and brush my teeth over the sink i would have never thought doing those two tasks again would bring me so much joy but it really has im starting to feel like myself again its nice to not be so reliant on other people for everything i feel so needy asking people to hand me things or grab me a blanket but i just can’t get up whenever i want yet ive always deemed myself a pretty selfreliant and independent person but i didnt know humility until ive had to live in the hospital for  months god always has a way of teaching you the lessons you need most and im finally learning ive also been able to get in my wheelchair more which is great because i am starting to get sick of being in bed so much my next big milestone will be getting my dumb brace off i have a countdown and its almost like waiting for christmas an xray next week will be the deciding factor and i pray that my spine has healed enough i cannot thank everyone enough for all the support ive received in the last almost  weeks ive received so many prayers well wishes visits present flowers snacks and more i appreciate and look forward to all the texts and cards just letting me know someones thinking about and praying for me those kinds of things really speed up the healing process please continue to pray for me as i get used to wheelchair mobility and relying on my arms for everything pray for my family and especially my dad whos been so great and helpful to me my dad has been truly a lifesaver as ive allowed so much responsibility to be placed in his hands and i really dont know if i could ever thank him enough i honestly dont know what id do without such a great support system love you all laura playing horseshoes with dad i won  read more update  posted by sarah stark  months ago    share  floating on well it has been almost a month since the collision in good ol idaho falls we have so much to be grateful for so much to be amazed by and still so much to think about and figure out life has calmed down a bit but that doesnt mean that any of us in my family have been able to really return to “normal” laura has been in eirmc’s inpatient rehab program for about a week now she has a room to herself due to the significance of her injuries and the need for special equipment shes always been highmaintenance oh wait thats me… but she seems to be adapting well and is really putting forth an awesome mindset she still has not regained feeling in her legs yet so she is in rehab to work on getting her independence back she has to learn or in some cases “relearn” how to do things like putting on clothes bathroom things transferring from bed to wheelchair sitting up and staying up propping herself up… its hard work she has about  hours of physical therapy and occupational therapy a day mondaysaturday and gets a bit of a break on sunday where she only has  minutes of “work” the other day she was able to get in a wheelchair a real one this time and go outside again this time she enjoyed it a lot more and actually said it was fun shes also taken some trips to the weight room to pump some iron to work on getting those arm muscles stronger for those keeping track of the ongoing brace saga laura is now in the brace for about  hours a day they put it on at the beginning of the day and she keeps it on until her last therapy session is over she even eats with it on shes definitely come a loooooong way the current issue is her blood pressure whenever they sit laura up properly in a chair her bp goes crazy and drops because after the month of craziness shes endured her body is just not used to being in a sitting position anymore however she says its beginning to be less of a nuisance so hopefully the bp complication works its way out soon as of today she told me she still has at least another  weeks in rehab in idaho from what i understand shell then be able to return home seminormally without major medical support needed once she gets back to michigan she will continue with an outpatient rehab program to continue treatment and support my dad returned to the mitten today for a few welldeserved nights of sleep in his own bed hes also going to begin the process of making his new house wheelchair accessible for my sister when she gets home laura is finally off of fluid restriction and is back to a regular diet im using the term “regular” loosely because she has now found the pediatric menu and has not since looked back chicken nuggets and fries for dinner is wayy more fun than turkey ala king  eight of lauras bike and build team members came and hung out with her for a couple days it was a total surprise for laura and she loved it she said they brought her tons of wendys and root beer floats they even shaved her legs for her… and if thats not true friendship then i dont know what is hahah im sooo glad she got to spend time with her friends family is great and awesome but sometimes you just need your pals friends are the best therapy so thats about it from us… just work work working lauras fighting hard every day sometimes i get stuck thinking about where we were  week ago…  weeks ago…  weeks ago and its just amazing the amount of progress she has made god had truly and completely been guiding us protecting us and strengthening us a few people have been asking me what they can send to laura as far as care packages go when i asked if she wantedneeded anything she said that for the most part she is totally set except that she is “lacking in the snack department” her treat reserve is running out as far as other kinds of gifts her room isnt gigantic and she wont be there forever so please keep her current storage situation and future shipping costs in mind haha as usual we want to say a loud thank you for loving us praying for us supporting us checking on us donating to us feeding us asking about us etc etc i could go on for days about how fortunate we are i thank god daily for all of the miracles and blessing we continue to see every single day as well as for all of the awesome people who are helping us out right now we are truly humbled please continue to keep laura and my family in mind and in prayer xoxsarah onethird of cus  read more help spread the word  share   tweet  k shares on facebook read a previous update previous update youre on update           next update subscribe to

highest  of  trees is fantastic several years ago cannot say exactly how long we planted  of these trees along the road in our front yard and their growth has been unbelievable they have both grown incredibly fast and now are both bearing nuts we would liked have given them a  star rating but one of them has fantastic nuts that are beyond belief in their taste and yield while the other one is bearing lots of nuts but they are not well formed and are not nearly as good as the ones on the other treebut they were good enough to encourage us to buy more and plant them in various place around our property we have been amazed beyond belief at how fast these trees have grown and the fact that only one of them didnt grow and had to be replaced if you want nut trees that are hardy fast growing beautiful and yield really great tasting nuts in a seemingly short amount of time then these could be the trees for you b u t you need a large space for them to grow large inthe year before last we were able to collect enough nuts to make a hickory nut pie using exactly the recipe for pecan pie and it was so good that our heads almost exploded it was beyond great it was too good to be put into wordsbut sadly last year the weather caused these very same trees to not bear more than a handful of nuts it was the same for almost all the nut trees in this area including the black walnuts that had been reliably bearing lots of nuts for years we were saddened but are looking forward to having nuts this year and unless something totally unforeseen happens we will have as the missouri mammoth hickories are growing like mad and are covered in flowersi would guess that anyone reading the review up to this point could perceive that we would without hesitation recommend these trees for anyone who has the space to grow at least two and if like us you have more space to grow  or thanks for reading our review happy growing and much love from tree lovers in kentucky was this review helpful yes

upper midwest zones most importantly pecan trees rely on summer heat and long growing seasons for nuts to mature and fillinproper pollinationpollination by a different pecan variety is key to the success of many pecan trees most of our pecan trees require pollination by a compatible variety for successful kernel growth and production inadequate pollination is a common reason why some pecan trees produce poorly or don’t bear nuts at all make sure you check our descriptions to see which pollinating varieties our experts recommendselfpollinating pecan trees are ideal if you don’t have enough growing space to plant a second variety if you do have room we always recommend planting another compatible variety for optimum pecan productionnote that pecan tree pollination works differently from other types of edibles typically pecan trees bloom and shed pollen at different times some shed pollen first and are receptive of pollen later “type i” and others bloom first and shed pollen later “type ii” it is highly recommended you plant at least one of each type as recommended for adequate cross pollinationmature tree sizepecan trees grow to be rather large depending on the
