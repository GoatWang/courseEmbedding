thursday after a decade as president of the federal reserve bank of dallas is best known not so much for what he said as for the way he said it credit brandon thibodeaux for the new york times dallas — in a decade as president of the federal reserve bank of dallas richard w fisher was frequently mistaken in his economic predictions but seldom boringthe departure of mr fisher who stepped down on thursday means that the fed is losing one of the most outspoken internal opponents of its stimulus campaign just as it is winding down mr fisher argued right up to his retirement that the central bank was increasing economic inequality destabilizing financial markets and might yet unleash higher inflation but he is best known not so much for what he said as for the way he said ithe spoke more often and more colorfully than any of his colleagues at the federal reserve larding his speeches with quotes anecdotes and metaphors among the most memorable was his  description of his breeding bull too big to fail as full of liquidity but unable to reach the pretty cows on the other side of the fence“his speeches have regularly been the most eloquent — a true joy to read his somewhat excessive texas exuberance in explaining both the successes and the possible excesses of monetary policy” the former fed chairman paul a volcker a mentor to mr fisher said in a recent introduction continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story noting that mr fisher was the rare noneconomist among senior fed officials mr volcker continued “in an era in which economists claim a natural right to central banking leadership dick has brought a healthy sense of reality sound judgment business background and leadership” video expresident of dallas fed on yellen richard w fisher

mr fisher also has angered those who think the fed can and should do more to help unemployed workers“he was wrong at the beginning and he’s still wrong now” said danny cendejas of the texas organizing project a nonprofit group that advocates for lowerincome texans “he’s ignoring the reality of what’s happening particularly in the latino community and in communities of color” advertisement continue reading the main story at the fed mr fisher was set apart by his views and his style he kept a list of roughly  executives at corporations ranging from walmart to american airlines to “the bud distributor in north texas” and he called several dozen before each fed meeting he insisted that those anecdotal reports offered a more accurate and timely window onto the economy than government data and the fed’s elaborate models“my local dry cleaner i would say that if you took him and put him against the whole fed staff in terms of forecasting he’s been far more accurate” mr fisher saidmr fisher now worries that the fed is waiting too long to raise rates and that its efforts to assist the recovery instead will cause another downturn he said the consequences of the fed’s stimulus campaign would not be clear for some time“how long” he said repeating a question “no idea and i hope my concerns which are only expressed as uncertainties prove to be sleep lost and nothing more”these warnings have made mr fisher a popular figure among the fed’s republican critics who also insist that the fed’s attempts to expand employment are doing more harm than good so did a february speech in which mr fisher told a new york audience that the fed should change its governance structure to limit the outsize role of the new york fedbut mr fisher has spoken sharply against calls from republican lawmakers for new restrictions on the fed’s authority he said he wanted the fed itself to make better decisionsmr fisher rose in horatio alger style from childhood poverty to marry the daughter of a prominent congressman and build a fortune of more than  million as an investor he worked his way through harvard as a cook and a crew member on the yacht of a wealthy alumnus and by renting his dorm room to amorous couples now he sits on harvard’s board of overseershe was born in los angeles in  to a norwegian mother and an australian father who met in south africa and conceived mr fisher in shanghai before moving to california a few years later propelled by poverty the family moved to mexico city where mr fisher learned to speak spanish fluently advertisement continue reading the main

the daughter of a texas congressman james collins the young couple lived in new york at first where mr fisher worked as an assistant to the banker robert roosa but mr fisher says that one day while on a ferry returning from the statue of liberty with his infant son he looked across the water at the new york skyline and decided to leave“i thought ‘this place is already made’” he recalled “things were moving my way but i just thought ‘this has already been built i need to go someplace new’”he made a fortune investing in distressed assets during the rocky years of the texas economy in the late s and early s after two failed runs for the united states senate he signed on with the clinton administration as a deputy trade representative in  he remained in washington until  when he got a call asking him if he’d like to come back to texas to run the dallas fedthe fed’s  regional branches together oversee the banking system operate payments infrastructure and conduct economic research their presidents also participate in setting monetary policy and the dallas fed has a longstanding preference for outspoken leadersmr fisher’s predecessor robert d mcteer was known for reciting cowboy poetry and for his disagreements with the fed chairman alan greenspan when mr fisher took the job he changed the hold music on the dallas fed’s phone system from country and western to classicalthe dallas fed’s board has yet to select mr fisher’s successor but diane swonk chief economist at mesirow financial in chicago said it was a good bet they would pick someone with a strong voice “they like to have people who are cowboys” she saidhe was one of the first fed officials to raise concerns about the health of the housing market yet he was also among the last to understand the depth of the resulting financial crisis he warned throughout most of  that inflation was the primary danger to the economy — a threat that has still not materialized — and that the bleak pronouncements of other fed officials were fueling an unwarranted sense of panicin august as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse he voted to raise interest rates which would have made the situation even worse advertisement continue reading the main story in december that year when the fed reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in a move to spur a recovery mr fisher cast the only dissenting vote after the meeting he decided the moment required solidarity and went to ben s bernanke the chairman to change his votebut mr fisher said in the interview here that he had not changed his mind he said the fed should never have pushed interest rates below  percent nor bought so many bondslike many of the fed’s critics on the left mr fisher emphasizes that he is deeply concerned about the damage caused by the great recession he says he simply does not believe the fed is helping he says holding down interest rates has mostly enriched the rich like his own familythe middle class is being squeezed he said “but the fed can’t fix that”the fed’s current chairwoman janet l yellen sometimes uses the metaphor of a car to talk about monetary policy mr fisher said he had frequently argued for the substitution of a ship “because there are no brakes”he told of serving as a student at the naval academy on the uss truckee a tanker as it collided with an aircraft carrier the uss wasp in june “the scariest thing was watching all the other ships pull over the horizon” he said and then draws the metaphor the fed’s portfolio which has swelled to more than  trillion is “an enormous amount of explosive fuel” and the danger is “an explosion of inflation”“my successors” he said “are going to have to be very careful in steering that ship” continue reading the main story
