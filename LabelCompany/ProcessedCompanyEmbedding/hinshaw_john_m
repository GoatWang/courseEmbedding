ethics statement bio email rss follow ahess recent posts by arik hesseldahl seven questions for the man shaking up hp’s operations john hinshaw march   at  am pt tweet share print after the toughest year in its history it may be a while before many hp employees have anything resembling a spring in their step but the fact is that that there are early encouraging signs that the turnaround ceo meg whitman is trying to engineer isn’t going to be impossible when the final book on hp is written and win or lose you know there will be books one of the primary characters will be john hinshaw a cio by experience — his last job was as cio at the defense and aerospace giant boeing — whitman hired him in late  with the title of executive vice president of technology and operations at any other company he would still carry the title of cio but in this case he has the cio reporting up to him because his portfolio of responsibilities is wider not only is it his role to make hp’s fundamental decisions around it but also to reengineer internal processes for how hp does things often you’ll hear whitman talk about how she’s aiming to simplify how hp engages its customers and about speeding up how decisions are made hinshaw is the man making that happen he’s the one who has shifted hp to using many cloudbased software products like salesforcecom workday and docusign and there will be more cloud deployments coming but he also sees his role as showing hp customers both existing and potential how it can be done at a large scale mixing cloud services with other approaches into something of a showcase one that he intends to show off i sat down with hinshaw recently at hp headquarters in palo alto and my first question was about his portfolio of responsibilities allthingsd john i know it’s not your title but i tend to think of you as hp’s cio in the sense that you’re the one who has been digging through the operational trenches looking for ways to improve operations and trim costs and you did the deals with salesforcecom and workday but my understanding of your portfolio of responsibilities stops there so could you explain more hinshaw sure most of my career i was in a cio role with boeing and verizon so it’s fun to see what’s going on at those companies now during those years i was a huge hp customer and so i bought billions worth of hp products and services over the years and i knew the company pretty well before i came in the thing that really attracted me to the job was that it would be well beyond what a typical cio does it was meg’s idea for me to go hire a cio — and i hired ramon baez — and for my job to cover a much broader operational portfolio so you have a cio reporting up to you can you draw your lines of responsibility for me in addition to the cio function i run the global business services group which is really shared services on steroids it’s all the internal operations and processes from executing payroll to marketing collateral to all the shared services across the company it’s  people and there’s a very global portfolio then i have global procurement for the entire company that’s  billion of procurement then i have global real estate and then i have global security which is physical security brand security and cyber security finally there’s sales operations — all the invoicing sales compensation work everything that happens behind the scenes in sales meg’s idea was to marry up the it function with all the other functions that keep the company going and they’re fundamentally linked so let’s take the salesforce deal a lot of companies have deployed salesforce but if the it organization is trying to do that they are looking at it from the point of view of changing their systems and managing their data when we did it we looked at it from a process perspective we designed our sales process and then the system followed that so we did the fastest rollout of salesforce implementation ever it was  employees and that made it the biggest ever too that’s the unique thing about what we’re doing at hp i’ve never seen anywhere else that can move that fast at scale usually you have one or the other but we have both what did moving to salesforce as a practical matter do for you what did you use before salesforce and workday did you see a big operational savings or cost savings we used siebel and peoplesoft the big thing is that our sales teams can sell faster they can now generate a quote right out of salesforcecom and could not do that before they have a comprehensive view of the customer when they are in that product — whether selling software hardware services it’s all right there their efficiency has gone up their satisfaction with their own work has gone up significantly it was  percent it’s now  percent the second thing is the speed at which we can implement new functionality we’ve done four releases so far and we have a fifth one coming up we can implement them much faster in salesforce than we could before we’re going to have this be the dashboard for the sales team where they have everything in there contacts contracts commissions everything in one spot we’ve also licensed a product enterprisewide called docusign when we would sign up a new reseller it used to take five weeks in the whole transaction process now it’s five days hp financial services would take two or three days of paperwork back and forth now it’s  minutes let’s talk about security we’ve all been hearing the chatter about hacking coming out of china the warnings from the administration and other companies complaining about being attacked by china we can only assume that hp has a lot of intellectual property and would thus be another presumed target your networks are probably always being probed if not overtly attacked what are you doing about it cyber security is a fascinating space i learned a lot about it at boeing it’s extremely important when you’re dealing with aerospace and governments the great news about hp is that we have the most comprehensive set of products and services designed for it and internally i’m the biggest user of all those products and services arcsight records  billion events a day we test that at scale before other customers get to use it we scan all our code through fortify to be sure there are no back doors and no issues we’re the biggest user of that product as well we use tipping point to keep track of how well our network traffic is flowing and we’ve got that standardized across hp so my job in protecting hp is easier than it would be at other companies because i have all these internal products at my disposal and then we have a services business that also offers security and they share information we recently hired a new guy art gilliland from symantec to run hp’s security products and brett whalen is our chief information security officer and they’re linked up to make sure they’re building security into all our products as well so let’s talk about  meg has called it the repairandrebuild year what does that mean to you i think we are laying the operational foundation for the turnaround each unit has plans and strategies that they’re going to execute on and they need technology and processes to make it happen from the sales processes to say in our enterprise services business to get the right sales tools to be able to execute there for example there’s a new matching tool that more effectively matches the labor force to what is needed in new contracts so when you have a contract that is winding down with  great security professionals and there’s another contract over here that is similar we can quickly match them up and go that has really helped we’re doing a lot as well in subcontracting so when we win a contract we staff it with hp people and then staff it with subcontractors and there wasn’t a real automated process for that so we’re implementing a tool called fieldglass a cloudbased product from the moment a manager needs a subcontractor to timekeeping and invoicing it’s all in the cloud similar for our software business you must have had a lot of resistance shaking things up as you did hp is an older company with a lot of ingrained processes what did you do about that what was the biggest assumption you had to blow up it’s interesting because i think of the open communication style that meg has created there hasn’t really been a lot of resistance i would have expected it in fact i think people were hungry for change and more automated processes if you look at the previous five or six years there was less investment in it even though we’re the world’s largest it company it was more focused on cutting costs in the it function than investing in tools people were pretty excited about a new sales process and a new hr process the area that required the most collaboration was in sales you had to get all four business units on board with the same process one view of the customer that took a lot of upfront work to get that right and everyone was used to doing it in a certain way but we got there now we’re the largest salesforce customer ever we’re the largest workday customer ever we’re the largest fieldglass customer ever we’re the largest docusign customer ever will you do more cloud deployments is there anything you won’t put on the cloud we will we’re going to put all our travel booking on the cloud completely with a thirdparty provider there will be more procurement right now we’re using sap’s ariba we’re implementing hana which will help us close our books faster workday will take us through the end of the year today i think manufacturing and financials in the erp and mrp space at this scale isn’t ready for the cloud yet if you look at our sap implementation today manufacturing for financials it’s running very well so that’s running inhouse on hp servers i think in a few years it will be ready for the cloud right now it’s about the complexity and scale and the number of transactions that have to be processed at scale i think it’s just a matter of time but today the workloads are too large to run on the cloud tagged with arcsight boeing cio cloud computing

verizons it organisation a top  ranking in computerworlds  best places to work in it awards along the way in  hinshaw was named cio of the year by the executives club of chicago and the association of information technology professionals and he was also recently honoured with the top ten leaders and change agents award at the global cio summit this year boeings it organisation was honoured by baseline magazine as one of five leaders in businesstechnology convergence additionally for the second straight year the uptime institute presented boeing it with an award for worldclass data centre operationsaccording to hinshaw the scale and scope of the products and services boeing offers is unrivalled by any other company in the world the scale and complexity of it at boeing is also much larger and more complex than anything he experienced at his previous roleswith  employees in australia including several hundred in it australia is boeings largest base outside the us and a large market for the company hinshaw describes boeing’s it souring model as balanced but says services are predominantly delivered inhouse because of the nature of the work involved boeing’s sourcing ratio stands at about  per cent sourced labour and  per cent inhouse hinshaw says others have done more but it is less so in the defence and aerospace industriesrecently in australia to meet with the staff and customers including the department of defence in canberra and australian government cio ann steward hinshaw spoke with cio about rationalising it surviving the financial crisis saas and cloud computing migrating  desktops to windows  and what it takes to be a good it leaderwhat are some of you cost reduction strategiesno cio is ever happy with costs its a constant mission to get costs lower every dollar spent at boeing on it could be spent on product development we spend less on it every year and get more value out of itboeing has renegotiated better terms with key suppliers and prioritised its it work we have tried to balance where the work is done and we are now more certain outsourced work gives good value for the dollarwith about  employees in  countries boeing has a lot of suppliers and needs to better leverage the one boeing across the company i can buy it products globally as opposed to in any one country which saves moneywhat are the most pressing issues for boeing a year after the gfcthe good thing about our business is there is a us billion backlog of defence and airline orders the number of orders for new planes has gone down but we will deliver more planes in  than in  there is still demand in emerging markets and new planes are  to  per cent more efficient that older aircraftwe have weathered the gfc well we are more judicious where we spend it capital the dreamliner had some delays which put pressure on it but we hope to fly it this monthhow is boeing’s housekeeping going are you rationalising the number of systems staff etcwhen i came on board the number one priority was to simplify it operations in  we had  corporate applications companywideeach business had their own it shops we brought them all together and have been rationalising applications at a rate of around  a year so this year it will be we also had about  data centres and are down to six today our roadmap is to have three which will save significant cost reduction in the power draindo you find it ironic that increasing use of technology for example telepresence may be reducing the need for flights thus impacting boeing’s businesswe use videoconferencing in boeing and we also travel a bit there are times where videoconferencing makes sense and times when a facetoface meeting makes sensewe want people to travel so there is a little bit of dichotomy but at the
