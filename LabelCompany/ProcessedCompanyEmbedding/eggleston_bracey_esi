motherhood and embracing a similar ‘impossible is nothing’ mantra esi said “my children are my proudest accomplishment being a mom on its own is really a fulltime job we have a slogan in our family that the bracey family doesn’t give up i pass the advice from my mother down to my kids everyday by role modeling and i try to set very clear priorities my kids are always first even if i’m  miles away” for esi mother’s day provides her time to reflect on what it means to be a mother and to spend time with her family as a woman who values quality time with her family it’s easy to understand why esi would like to see mother’s day extended beyond the oneday annual celebration and carried into everyday life when asked if she could tell her mom only one thing what would it be esi said “if i could tell my mother one thing it would be thank you for setting a high standard because i have taken that on not just for my life but for my whole family’s life” this mother’s day we join esi in
