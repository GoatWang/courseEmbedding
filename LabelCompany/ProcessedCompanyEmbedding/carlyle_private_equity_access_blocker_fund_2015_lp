with the market visibility of the secondary investments team alpinvest partners fund investments team is positioned to quickly and efficiently identify trends secondaries solutions for private equity investors as allocations to private equity have grown investors have sought new ways to manage their exposure to this historically illiquid asset class alpinvest partners’ dedicated secondary investments team is highly experienced in this market acquiring or restructuring portfolios of private equity assets ranging in size from € million to more than € billion coinvestments the coinvestment team seeks to achieve attractive private equity returns through a welldiversified portfolio of coinvestments the team works to maximize the number of pipeline investment opportunities and select the most attractive investments with qualified sponsors the coinvestment team has the flexibility to either come in early in a deal process to help underwrite a transaction alongside a sponsor or to participate in a broader coinvestment syndication process and the ability to focus on a broad range of deal types and industries to build a welldiversified portfolio we believe that alpinvest’s strategy is different from the strategy of other coinvestment managers in several ways dedicated approach alpinvest has one of the largest dedicated and most experienced teams in the coinvestment market consisting of  individuals with a collective experience of more than  years in private equity   active and reliable underwriting partner alpinvest’s expertise in playing an active role early on alongside sponsors in a deal process is a key differentiator in securing proprietary deal flow and allocations   leverage the scale of alpinvest’s funds and coinvestment program alpinvest is one of the largest and most experienced institutional investors in the global private equity market the firm’s substantial primary fund investment activities including the ability to commit significant amounts to a single fund as a limited partner is of considerable strategic value to sponsors and can be a significant factor when sourcing coinvestments over the past decade alpinvest has formed strong relationships with major private equity sponsors through the firm’s coinvestment activities primary investments and secondary investments further enhancing our selection capabilities   structured sponsor and deal analysis alpinvest takes a two tiered approach to the selection and diligence of coinvestment opportunities focusing on both i the assessment of the sponsor’s ability to effectively execute and add value and ii on the quality of a transaction the alpinvest funds team performs substantial diligence on each sponsor enabling alpinvest to better assess if a sponsor is positioned to implement the value creation thesis alpinvest utilizes a proprietary framework to analyze the strengths of sponsors across multiple dimensions such as geography industry deal type and complexity of the value creation thesis this coupled with a granular analysis of the opportunity based on extensive due diligence led by our specialized and dedicated alpinvest coinvestment team has led to better informed investment decisions we believe this detailed approach differentiates alpinvest in the market team team member title location industry victor backstrom managing director london
