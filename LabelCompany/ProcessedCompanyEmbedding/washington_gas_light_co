staff has a brain  reason cant wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them another one star review what a horrible company  the website was down for almost a year and then sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible customer service especially for a utility that the public depends on without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all day want a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled want to talk to a scheduler for either they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them when they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from them without question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers this place would be a negative if yelp allowed it as is evidenced by the reviews wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions i hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gas meticulously review your bills after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure fine whatever thereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete wow i am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseas ill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address they must be using tandy computers leftover from  with  baud modems to connect to the internet the worst company in the world put it this way once they make a mistake on their end all hell breaks lose youll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere managers that say they will help and nothing happens lies and deceitful back office that doesnt communicate with one another just a complete nightmare common sense where are you after being told a technician would be here today between  am and  pm i called wg at  to ask where they were no one has called no one has come i was told by two different supervisors that our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field seriously i asked what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them again came the response our dispatchers have no way to reach our technicians once they are out in the field please be on the watch for wg technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place catch one if you can based on my experience and those of my neighbors in georgetown washington gas is not accountable transparent or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets reported a possible gas leak at pm and upon follow up at pm there was no record of the call after some research found the report no time estimate possible called back at pm no record of call  submitted another call for leak inspection again no time estimate possible said just call back in  hours if no show would give no star if possible their customer services is does not exist their website gives you a phone number which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone i had ended my service when i moved out of my apartment but recently discovered that i was still being charged i sent in information for a refund and im here a month later with no response besides allow sufficient time for an investigation a month should be enough time with all the documentation i provided still out over  of a refund and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out i just got charged again this is ridiculous i would give them zero stars if i could worst customer service ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas they took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in december  six months and  calls later i still have not received my deposit wg should not be a monopoly we should be able to choose our gas company literally the worst company i have had the displeasure of trying to work with i tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take  days from the day i called to make that happen i accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being then comes my monday appointment of which they gave me the time frame of ampm i quite literally had to cancel anything i had scheduled for the day and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up they finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight are you joking what kind of company is this and so alas i am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow they

the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with  you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people  having problems with your

and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themwhen they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street  this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from themwithout question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to

arlington va  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow bryan c stop following bryan c  i hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gasmeticulously review your bills  after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills  since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online  it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month  interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history  they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills  she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days  i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete  wowi am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseasill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system  when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address  they must be using tandy computers

c james h simmonds and simmonds coleburn towner  carman arlington va on brief for appellee before haynsworth chief judge murrah senior circuit judge and craven circuit judge craven circuit judge  this is an appeal from a decision of the district court holding certain practices of the virginia electric and power company vepco to be per se violations of section i of the sherman act  usc §  and also violations of section  of the clayton act  usc §  two issues are presented to us either of which may be decisive of the appeal one is whether the complained of practices by vepco are state action and therefore exempt from the purview of federal antitrust legislation parker v brown  us   s ct   l ed   the other is whether vepco sold only one product electricity so as to take the case out of the tiein doctrine of fortner enterprises inc v united states steel corporation  us   s ct   l ed d   we decide both issues in favor of vepco and reverse i  vepco is a state regulated utility supplying electricity to areas of virginia also served by the plaintiff gas utility washington gas light company prior to  practically all residences served by vepco obtained electrical power through overhead distribution lines these lines were relatively inexpensive to install and were provided by vepco at no charge to new home builders early in the s installation of underground service lines became increasingly popular until  vepco agreed to install underground residential distribution urd lines instead of the common overhead variety if the builder agreed to pay the additional expenses involved usually amounting to a sum around   in  vepco began the first in a series of allelectric house plans designed to make it more attractive for the builder to install electric appliances in their new homes to the exclusion of the competing utility — natural gas washington gas light company complains that these programs violated the sherman and clayton acts the district courts findings reveal that the first plans offered urd installation free of charge if the builder went all electric or at a substantially reduced rate if he went all electric except for heating and provided his own trenching and backfilling  the state legislature in  by statutory amendment specifically required virginias utility regulatory body the state corporation commission scc to investigate the promotional allowances and practices of public utilities and to    take such action as such investigation may indicate to be in the public interest after the commissions subsequent disapproval of the earlier vepco plans new programs were instituted giving credit on urd installation based on anticipated electrical usage the anticipated consumption was computed through tables listing annual kilowatt hours used by various home appliances the larger the estimated usage the larger the credit against urd installation charges the practical effect of going all electric under the new plan was the same as under the old — the credit given for residences going all electric was usually sufficient to cover the entire cost of urd installation subsequently vepcos base installation charges were considerably reduced and remained in effect until march of  when the lower courts prohibition became effective  the result of vepcos installation campaign was that significant inroads were made into areas previously dominated by the use of natural gas — home heating water heating and cooking  the district court found the vepco plans per se violations of section i of the sherman act as illegal tying arrangements and also violations of section  of the clayton act as exclusive dealing arrangements without consideration of the parker supra exemption it is urged upon us that since the district court did not consider the application of parker neither should we desert palace inc v salisbury  fd   th cir  we think the rigid application of such a rule of procedure is inappropriate where the record provides an adequate basis for consideration on the merits as the supreme court stated in hormel v helvering  us    s ct    l ed    rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice not to defeat them a rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with this policy orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice  accord dudley v inland mutual insurance co  fd  th cir  indeed if deemed necessary to reach the correct result an appellate court may sua sponte consider points not presented to the district court and not even raised on appeal by any party see e g united states v continental can co  us     s ct   l ed d   in parker the court held a  california raisin marketing program conducted by a state commission permissible even assuming the action would have been violative of the antitrust laws had the same plan been adopted by private individuals operating outside the states direction  we find nothing in the language of the sherman act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature    it is the state acting through the commission which adopts the program and which enforces it with penal sanctions in the execution of a governmental policy   us at   sct at   to find shelter under parker the acts complained of must be the result of state action either by state officials or by private individuals under the active supervision of the state allstate insurance company v lanier  fd   th cir  although proposals may originate privately if their execution depends on state regulation or actual state implementation parker supra  us at   sct at   the teaching of parker v brown is that the antitrust laws are directed against individual and not state action when a state has a public policy against free competition in an industry important to it the state may regulate that industry in order to control or in a proper case to eliminate competition therein it may even permit persons subject to such control to participate in the regulation provided their activities are adequately supervised by independent state officials  asheville tobacco board of trade inc v ftc  fd   th cir   if the exemption is to be applied to a regulated industry such as a state utility then it can extend only to those activities which fall under state supervision see wainwright v national dairy products corp  f supp   ndga the regulatory agency must be a creature of the state and not one whose activities are governed by private agreement without any real state control sun valley disposal co v silver state disposal co  fd   th cir  e w wiggins airways inc v massachusetts port authority  fd   st cir  allstate insurance co v lanier supra  the virginia state corporation commission is without question a proper state agency to qualify under parker section  of the virginia state constitution makes explicit provision for the scc giving it the power among other things to prescribe utility rates and subject to the authority of the state legislature to regulate other nonspecified corporate utility activities sections of the virginia code provide a detailed system of regulatory powers and procedures whereby administrative action may be taken and reviewed with respect to rates tolls charges schedules etc  there can be no doubt and in fact washington gas light does not argue to the contrary that the scc is a regulatory arm of the state possessing both the authority and powers necessary to qualify under parker instead the gas company argues that even though the scc was aware of vepcos urd activities before  it made no investigations and gave no affirmative approval or disapproval of the vepco plans and that vepcos conduct was therefore individual and not state action the argument is not without merit but the conclusion is not inevitable unless one equates administrative silence with abandonment of administrative duty it is just as sensible to infer that silence means consent i e approval indeed the latter inference seems the more likely one when we remember that even the gas company concedes that the scc possessed adequate regulatory powers to stop vepco if it chose to do so and that eventually scc spoke affirmatively and first modified and finally ended the promotional practices upon which the suit was based the antitrust laws are a poor substitute we think for plaintiffs failure to promptly protest to the scc and to seek the administrative remedy ultimately shown to have been available and effective we think vepcos promotional practices were at all times within the ambit of regulation and under the control of scc and we hold these practices exempt from the application of the laws of antitrust under the parker doctrine ii  there is at the outset of every tiein case including the familiar cases involving physical goods the problem of determining whether two separate products are in fact involved fortner enterprises v united states steel corporation  us    s ct    l ed d    alternatively we rest our decision upon the very difficult determination of this ultimate question of fact in fortner five members of the supreme court concluded that the extension of credit on favorable terms for the purchase of real property in an amount totaling over two million dollars by a wholly owned subsidiary of the united states steel corporation was a separate tying product resulting in compulsion to buy prefabricated buildings to be erected on the purchased property from united states steel although the court did not lay down any general test for finding two products in a given case it did discuss various factors which may have entered into the decision including these   the credit offered and the prefabricated buildings were each supplied by a separate corporation   the tied product prefabricated buildings were sold at an artificially high price — some  more than a competitive product of similar quality   the credit obtained was in excess of that needed to purchase the desired real property and included enough to finance the artificially inflated cost of prefabricated houses   the loans totaling over two million dollars could not be obtained on any terms unless the prefabricated homes were bought exclusively from united states steel corporation   the price of the tied product prefabricated buildings was not a regulated price and united states steel was as free to further its market penetration by price reduction as by offering uniquely advantageous credit  it seems to us that vepco sold only one product — electricity the delivery of that product has always been an ancillary and necessary part of the business of producing and selling electrical power this was simply a new method of delivery but paid for in the old way i e free to the customer there was no separate market for the installation of underground wiring as there was a separate market for credit in fortner that there are not dual markets strongly suggests there are not separate products see timespicayune publishing co v united states  us    s ct   l ed    even in fortner four members of the court thought that united states steel was selling one product namely prefabricated buildings and that the provision of credit on a large scale to finance the purchase of land not just the buildings was simply an ancillary service in connection with making the sale the dissenters noted that  almost all modern selling involves providing some ancillary services in connection with making the sale — delivery installation supplying fixtures servicing    customarily — indeed almost invariably — the seller offers these ancillary services only in connection with the sale of his own products and they are often offered without cost or at bargain rates   us at   sct at  emphasis added  unlike united states steels inflated price of the tied product prefabricated homes vepcos rates for home heating and consumption of electricity although higher than the rates for gas which would do the same job were not arbitrarily inflated but had been approved by the corporation commission there was nothing artificial about the price of electricity as there was with respect to the price of the prefabricated homes  finally the ultimate effect of the fortner type monopoly was to sell the tied prefabricated homes at an artificial inflated price in a market where the same identical prefabricated houses of similar quality could have been obtained by the consumer at a cost  cheaper washington gas competing product is not identical or even necessarily of the same quality in the subjective sense some consumers may prefer electricity despite the greater heating efficiency of gas some may not want to be bothered with two monthly bills from two different companies and two problems of maintenance and repair of two different systems electricity is simply different from gas and may be subjectively preferred by a consumer despite its higher cost and the latters greater efficiency whether such a preference if it exists is a permissible one in our economy can better be determined by the expertise of a regulatory agency than random application of antitrust laws  in gas light co of columbus v georgia power co  f supp   mdga judge elliott considered and discussed the decision below in this case  the curious thing about the opinion is the courts assumption that underground residential distribution and electricity are two separate products so that one can be tied to the other as computer cards were tied to ibm machines in international business machines corp v united states  us   s ct   l ed   to my mind underground residential distribution is merely a method by which a product — electricity — is delivered to the consumer it might be compared to a department stores delivery of merchandise bought by a customer living fifteen miles out in the country — if that customer bought a single necktie it is doubtful the store would treat the delivery the same way it would if the customer bought a wardrobe underground residential distribution is ancillary to both the seller and buyer of the product in much the same way as a free meal given to an airline passenger is ancillary to the sale of an airline ticket therefore it is difficult to see how there could be a separate tying product in the commercial sense or how such a case could be fit within the tying clause concept  with the greatest respect for the decision of the district judge we nevertheless think that his ultimate finding of fact that there were two separate products was clearly erroneous and mistaken  we suggest that the rationale and underlying purpose of both the sherman and clayton acts is to prevent monopoly where it is not in the public interest it has long since been established that both gas and electricity can best be produced and distributed and the public benefited by monopoly under state regulation the problem here is not one of preventing monopoly as in fortner but of making lawful monopoly work best in the public interest doubtless we think scc can do a better job than private piecemeal application of laws aimed against monopoly  reversed notes  of the tenth circuit sitting by designation  vacode ann §    in april of  the scc issued an order prohibiting all promotional allowances of utilities but allowed commitments made under prior plans to be fulfilled thus our decision is of no great consequence for the future presumably vepco has discontinued the practices which are the basis for this suit  see also woods exploration  production company v aluminum company of america  f supp   sd tex  §  when commission may fix rates schedules etc — if upon

the sale of a product as an inseparable part of the transaction but it distinguished the fortner transaction as clearly involving two products because of two facts the loan and the tied goods were sold by separate corporations and the loan was for an amount larger than that needed to pay the seller of the tied product the supreme court  term  harv lrev    washington gas  a wgl company skip

not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible customer service especially for a utility that the public depends on without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all day want a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled want to talk to a scheduler for either they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them when they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from them without question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers this place would be a negative if yelp allowed it as is evidenced by the reviews wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions i hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gas meticulously review your bills after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure fine whatever thereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete wow i am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseas ill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address they must be using tandy computers leftover from  with  baud modems to connect to the internet the worst company in the world put it this way once they make a mistake on their end all hell breaks lose youll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere managers that say they will help and nothing happens lies and deceitful back office that doesnt communicate with one another just a complete nightmare common sense where are you after being told a technician would be here today between  am and  pm i called wg at  to ask where they were no one has called no one has come i was told by two different supervisors that our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field seriously i asked what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them again came the response our dispatchers have no way to reach our technicians once they are out in the field please be on the watch for wg technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place catch one if you can based on my experience and those of my neighbors in georgetown washington gas is not accountable transparent or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets reported a possible gas leak at pm and upon follow up at pm there was no record of the call after some research found the report no time estimate possible called back at pm no record of call  submitted another call for leak inspection again no time estimate possible said just call back in  hours if no show would give no star if possible their customer services is does not exist their website gives you a phone number which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone i had ended my service when i moved out of my apartment but recently discovered that i was still being charged i sent in information for a refund and im here a month later with no response besides allow sufficient time for an investigation a month should be enough time with all the documentation i provided still out over  of a refund and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out i just got charged again this is ridiculous i would give them zero stars if i could worst customer service ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas they took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in december  six months and  calls later i still have not received my deposit wg should not be a monopoly we should be able to choose our gas company literally the worst company i have had the displeasure of trying to work with i tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take  days from the day i called to make that happen i accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being then comes my monday appointment of which they gave me the time frame of ampm i quite literally had to cancel anything i had scheduled for the day and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up they finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight are you joking what kind of company is this and so alas i am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow they cant guarantee a single thing worst company ever washington gas unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a representative claim this business to view

others about washington gasmeticulously review your bills  after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills  since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online  it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month  interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history  they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills  she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days  i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete  wowi am

guess is it was designed in  its slow and the bill pay service is archaic good luck getting anything of substance from the site i have signed up for autopay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect in addition i schedule payments and they dont show on the website although i receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled but with that said i have had no problems with their service hence the  stars washington gas your payment options are unbelievably torturous your website never works and your telephone assistance is subpar repetitive annoying and unproductive it takes  mins to make a payment if youre lucky and dont get hung up on for one mistaken number entered please upgrade your services sincerely at my wits end with you why am i not surprised that this terrible company has  star for the past two years since ive had wg every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments i then have to log on to my account and send screen shots this is the third time it is happening seriously guys maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain  reason cant wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them another one star review what a horrible company  the website was down for almost a year and then sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible customer service especially for a utility that the public depends on without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all day want a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled want to talk to a scheduler for either they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them when they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from them without question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers this place would be a negative if yelp allowed it

follow jeffrey f stop following jeffrey f  without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with  you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people  having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all daywant a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduledwant to talk to a scheduler for either  they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themwhen they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street  this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from themwithout question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because

reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gasmeticulously review your bills  after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills  since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online  it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month  interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history  they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills  she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days  i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete  wowi am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseasill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system  when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address  they must be using tandy computers leftover from  with  baud modems to connect to the internet was this review … useful  funny  cool j rabbit  rockville md  friend

service at my home he took his time to investigated why i smelled gas found the problem and it ended up with a easy fix from a month ago he listened to what i had back then and found my problem that otherwise he would have to shut my gas off he took care of it simple fix i am asking to have him commended for his time and his patience thank you much to my surprise the late night washington gas customer service is fantastic i called washington gas at  pm to report a nonemergency problem and a technician came to my house and completely resolved the issue by  pm both the technician and phone operator were shockingly competent and nice the technician even voluntarily helped change my ac filter their website may just well be the worst on the internet my guess is it was designed in  its slow and the bill pay service is archaic good luck getting anything of substance from the site i have signed up for autopay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect in addition i schedule payments and they dont show on the website although i receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled but with that said i have had no problems with their service hence the  stars the physical washington gas location has very pleasant employees i even had to call the emergency line once because of my carbon monoxide alarms going off despite it being around  am they had someone at my house in about  minutes to check everything as far as paying bills or getting ahold of someone on the phone it would be hard to give this company even  stars everything is outsouced to the philippines i believe the bill pay area of their website is a mess its so bad now i just go pay my bill at their office despite the inconvenience horrible experience with their phone customer service on multiple instances the only reason i am giving two stars is because when i had to go to a center in person the woman there was helpful and apologetic i was trying to start service from out of state and my apartment complex was very clear that i couldnt get the keys until i gave them utility account numbers i spent at least an hour and a half on hold total during all of my calls they couldnt transfer service over the phone and asked me if i lived in vermont i was moving from ri to va told me to fax or email two forms of id and my lease agreement which i did and after speaking to numerous people i was told i had to set it up in person i lived  hours away luckily my complex worked with me and i went after i had moved in as i said the woman who helped me was able to set up my account in minutes and had no idea why they wouldnt do it over the phone apologizing to me and then two weeks later i get a letter in the mail saying that they received my email with my lease agreement but need two forms of id had mistyped my email address and clearly i already have service i dont think ive ever dealt with such incompetent customer service hopefully i wont have to deal with them again until i move out this service via the phone is absolutely horrible i am a new customer and they gave me a  hour window for the time to wait a little long but i requested they come first thing in the morning i have done this with every other utility company and they usually come earlier in the morning rather than later they said i would receive a confirmation call no confirmation call the day before so i called to confirm there are still nothing in the notes as requested to ask the technician to come earlier in the morning i request them to add it in the notes again well the morning is progressing so i call to see if they are still coming even though i called in twice there is still nothing in the notes and they cannot call the technician to verify because guess what they are in the phillipines i have to spell out every single word because their first language is not english seriously this is an excellent reason why they should not outsource jobs to foreign countries washington gas you need to bring the call center back to the us so customers dont need to call in  times to attempt to get a question answered it is a shame that washington gas is a monopoly the only reason they get two stars is because the technican was very professional and did the job quickly i didnt feel the slightest bit uncomfortable with him as a female in the home alone if i was reviewing the technician at the home it would be a  but i will likely interact an idiotic customer service much more than the technician the gas works but ive had several billing problems already in the first  months the website is terrible they havent responded to customer service online submissions and good luck finding someone on the phone who speaks english well literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though washington gas your payment options are unbelievably torturous your website never works and your telephone assistance is subpar repetitive annoying and unproductive it takes  mins to make a payment if youre lucky and dont get hung up on for one mistaken number entered please upgrade your services sincerely at my wits end with you rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible

company ever this place would be a negative if yelp allowed it as is evidenced by the reviews wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions washington gas is the worst utility company ever in anticipation for a may th move to hyattsville md i called on may  to have the gas turned on and placed n my name when i moved in on the th there was no gas service i called and they said there was perhaps an issue with the gas line they scheduled a technician to arrive some time on friday june nd mind you they cant give you an eta or time of day for the technician so you have to be home all day this doesnt work out if you have a job that doesnt allow you to take off with short notice i called the morning of june nd to confirm the appointment the customer service rep said it looked like i had no contract so she set up a contract and then confirmed that a tech would be out to service the line i waited all day and the tech was a no show i called first thing monday today and the rep said they had too many emergency calls to get to my order on friday she promised someone would be out today the tech showed up about an hour later however he was across the street i had to wave him down he came by and asked my name according to his tablet my name was placed on the account for the vacant house across the street and he told me he couldnt service my gas line because the order was made for the other house and its meter number so i had to call the washington gas again to walk them through the process of associating my name with the correct address thankfully the rep i worked with was willing to take things slow confirm the information and had it reviewed by her manager although she said it could take up to  days to get someone out she promised someone would be out today my fingers are crossed washington gas shame on you for treating your customers like they dont matter because of the monopoly you have on the dc area why am i not surprised that this terrible company has  star for the past two years since ive had wg every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments i then have to log on to my account and send screen shots this is the third time it is happening seriously guys maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain  reason cant wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them another one star review what a horrible company  the website was down for almost a year and then sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company the worst company in the world put it this way once they make a mistake on their end all hell breaks lose youll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere managers that say they will help and nothing happens lies and deceitful back office that doesnt communicate with one another just a complete nightmare not sure i have a single positive thing to say about this business its frustrating that there arent any other options when i moved into my apartment the former landlord who is also a moron told me my gas was taken care of trusting him i never tried to sign up for an account the gas was working just fine and continued to work for the next year and two months one day i notice it stops working so i call the landlord at this point its a new landlord he calls the gas company and they tell me that its been turned off because no one has paid the bill what they say i need to call so i do i get this completely rude and ignorant person on the phone who tells me its my fault and that i was naive to think i could just get free gas i tell her no my landlord told me it was included but that also if it hadnt been paid they should have sent notice she said they dont send notices as its the customers responsibility to know when they havent paid a bill i ask her why after fifteen months of unpaid service they wouldnt notify a single person she begins to get angry and say its my fault basically tells me i dont understand how utility payments work and that i have to pay an outstanding balance of  in order to regain service she also told me i would have to bring a copy of my lease to the office in dc in order to pay these bills i tell her i dont really have time do to all that and she says thats my problem too bad after talking to several different people i finally managed to get a very sweet woman on the phone who said the other woman was only trying to make things hard for me i eventually had the situation resolved with this nice woman but holy crap this company knows it has you trapped so it doesnt care if it provides

i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though washington gas your payment options are unbelievably torturous your website never works and your telephone assistance is subpar repetitive annoying and unproductive it takes  mins to make a payment if youre lucky and dont get hung up on for one mistaken number entered please upgrade your services sincerely at my wits end with you rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook

care if it provides horrible service based on my experience and those of my neighbors in georgetown washington gas is not accountable transparent or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets their customer services is does not exist their website gives you a phone number which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone i had ended my service when i moved out of my apartment but recently discovered that i was still being charged i sent in information for a refund and im here a month later with no response besides allow sufficient time for an investigation a month should be enough time with all the documentation i provided still out over  of a refund and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out i just got charged again this is ridiculous yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all day want a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled want to talk to a scheduler for either they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them when they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from them without question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers i would give them zero stars if i could worst customer service ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas they took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in december  six months and  calls later i still have not received my deposit wg should not be a monopoly we should be able to choose our gas company this is the worst company i have ever dealt with in my life not only did i have to call repeatedly to be charged for my bill never received a bill in the mail or online but they never even read my meter then i was nervous that my roommates would move out and they would charge me a huge backedup bill bc they never sent it and this is exactly what happened which left me stuck with the bill i have zero idea how this company operates but the people in charge need to be held accountable for this completely terrible service i still have yet to receive a bill even after i called to give them my money absurd they also overcharged me on the one bill that they did send this utility has the worst customer service i have ever encountered huge problem on my bill their fault and they refused to explain it to me refused i wish i had an alternative i would like to give them negative stars website is the worst if it was possible to get zero stars that would be my preference it is currently below freezing in dc just moved here and setting up service the apt i am renting has no heat or hot water turned on when i moved in which is normal i have asthma havent had an attack in years that is triggered by the cold and have already used by breathing machine x this weekend and had to get a hotel sunday night i had a service window from ampm monday the guy called at  and said he was on his way called the gas company at pm and he was pulled onto another job they werent going to call or reschedule i asked them to please come out my asthma was really bad from being in the cold apt all day and i was having serious trouble breathing at this point and having difficulty even getting my words out to the technician i called x x to express that i am in an emergency situation have no where to go in a new city and cant afford another hotel bc they cannot honor their commitment i put my health in jeopardy to honor the time slot they provided but they didnt seem to care i was told over and over again this is not an emergency for them and if i want to go to the hospital that is my choice my husband then called and pleaded for the supervisor to have some sympathy for an asthmatic that is having an attack bc they didnt honor their commitment they said a technician would be here by midnight i just received another call its pm they are hoping someone will get here by am so let just pretend they will show up tonight i would have been waiting here for  hours i am currently attached to my breathing machine which i havent used in years the people at washington gas have no humanity one woman i spoke to told me her son has asthma and she knows how scary and painful an attack is but she still cant help me if i were you i would expect the least from this company and then you may

circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and i called this morning and they confirmed again i am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming four days out of work and my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers customer service dispatch and contractors this is only the tip of the iceberg of what i have been through washington gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the note so i saw it sat morning  and called to have the gas turned back on but was told that washington gas doesnt work on weekends so it would be monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on unbelievable they cant turn the gas on because washington gas technicians dont work weekends i have been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible customer service especially for a utility that the public depends on without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all day want a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled want to talk to a scheduler for either they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them when they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from them without question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers this place would be a negative if yelp allowed it as is evidenced by the reviews wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions i hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gas meticulously review your bills after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure fine whatever thereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete wow i am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseas ill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address they must be using tandy computers leftover from  with  baud modems to connect to the internet the worst company in the world put it this way once they make a mistake on their end all hell breaks lose youll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere managers that say they will help and nothing happens lies and deceitful back office that doesnt communicate with one another just a complete nightmare common sense where are you after being told a technician would be here today between  am and  pm i called wg at  to ask where they were no one has called no one has come i was told by two different supervisors that our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field seriously i asked what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them again came the response our dispatchers have no way to reach our technicians once they are out in the field please be on the watch for wg technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place catch one if you can based on my experience and those of my neighbors in georgetown washington gas is not accountable transparent or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets reported a possible gas leak at pm and upon follow up at pm there was no record of the call after some research found the report no time estimate possible called back at pm no record of call  submitted another call for leak inspection again no time estimate possible said just call back in  hours if no show would give no star if possible their customer services is does not exist their website gives you a phone number which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone i had ended my service when i moved out of my apartment but recently discovered that i was still being charged i sent in information for a refund and im here a month later with no response besides allow sufficient time for an investigation a month should be enough time with all the documentation i provided still out over  of a refund and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out i just got charged again this is ridiculous i would give them zero stars if i could worst customer service ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas they took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in december  six months and  calls later i still have not received my deposit wg should not be a monopoly we should be able to choose our gas company literally the worst company i have had the displeasure of trying to work with i tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take  days from the day i called to make that happen i accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being then comes my monday appointment of which they gave me the time frame of ampm i quite literally had to cancel anything i had scheduled for the day and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up they finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight are you joking what kind of company is

washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month  interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history  they took my money but never credited my account i called customer

investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days  i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they

archaic good luck getting anything of substance from the site i have signed up for autopay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect in addition i schedule payments and they dont show on the website although i receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled but with that said i have had no problems with their service hence the  stars why am i not surprised that this

this is the third time it is happening seriously guys maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain  reason cant wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them another one star review what a horrible company  the website was down for almost a year and then sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me i have had to go to social media to see if i can get help i have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house i am converting my oven water heater and fireplace i am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter first and second time no one showed up third time they showed up but i need to airflow to add a piece of equipment this has been installed so i called and setup an appointment i called washington gas

my window was  am to  pm now my husband will have to be at the house on friday from  am to  pm this is ridiculous if there was another gas company i could use i would be out of here someone high up

to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street they left a note on the door at  am on thursday  saying they had turned off the gas i dont use the door where they left the

washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i

sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill online well obviously i cant because it doesnt work have a nice day maam and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey kill me since no one in customer service seems to be

guess is it was designed in  its slow and the bill pay service is archaic good luck getting anything of substance from the site i have signed up for autopay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect in addition i schedule payments and they dont show on the website although i receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled but with that said i have had no problems with their service hence the  stars washington gas your payment options are unbelievably torturous your website never works and your telephone assistance is subpar repetitive annoying and unproductive it takes  mins to make a payment if youre lucky and dont get hung up on for one mistaken number entered please upgrade your services sincerely at my wits end with you why am i not surprised that this terrible company has  star for the past two years since ive had wg every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments i then have to log on to my account and send screen shots this is the third time it is happening seriously guys maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain  reason cant wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them another one star review what a horrible company  the website was down for almost a year and then sporadically works  you cannot autopay you must send a check  phone service wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again  moving out you have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out

have to send them proof of moving out or they will send you a bill to your new address for your old address does that make any sense whatsoever terrible company literally everyone i have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered at one point i was literally told that i had missed my appointment because i wasnt home when i in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them the man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though yelp needs a negative star rating washington gas customer support people are utterly useless both from calling their support number and emailing customersupportwashgascom took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue where the home builders bill was on my account over the course of a month i spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful emailing customersupportwashgascom is even worse all they do is copy and paste prewritten bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed nothing i received by email was ever helpful so pretty much their customer support is useless cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues it would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office the problem was that someone on the wash gas end screwed up when i called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date which caused the builders bill to show up in my account whatever finally got it resolved try to hire some smarter people for your customer support rating systems need to have negative stars for messed up circumstances when calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows if they dont show up then oh well try again another day they are very good at turning your gas off not so much with getting it turned back on some techs call but most dont one showed up about two to three days after i called at a time when no one would be home i am literally at the complaining to third parties stage seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds i even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month i havent even moved into the apartment that requires a washington gas account yet and i can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure unmitigated hell as everyone else has already said their website is a complete abomination it astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website to begin with it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay you can try as i did multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks and you will continuously get an error message i emailed their help desk and their response was essentially yes sorry about that weve been having technical difficulties bye i responded with something along the lines of ok so i just dont make an online profile then no response that was just the beginning we just had service started to this apartment which we havent actually moved into yet so i suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort but strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks once i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks man so i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yet but the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the th yes maam can i go ahead and do that then hold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to

strangely enough when i checked my balance online it said  when i called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system it also said it was  since we dont live in the apartment yet we havent been getting the mail there so i cant verify whether or not they sent a paper bill that shouldnt matter though because its  and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checksonce i speak to a human he confirms that i do indeed owe a  fee due in six days mhm i ask him how i am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is  after informing me that the problem is not us maam the problem is the internet he redirects me to the same automated number that wont let me pay because it thinks my account balance is  thanks manso i call again i speak to a second person and explain the issue im having she casually tells me that its showing up as a  balance because i dont have an actual gas bill added to it yetbut the  is still due on the th and i have to pay it by the thyes maamcan i go ahead and do that thenhold on while i redirect you to someone who can help you with that back to the automated payment line i call a third time i speak to a third person i explain that this is my third time calling and that i have no way to pay the  balance i wouldnt even have known about if i hadnt called to ask she tries to direct me to the automated payment line again nope no absolutely no thats not working im sorry for the technical issues maam and i suggest you try the line again in a few hours no definitely not reluctantly she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank accountrouting numbers which im assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number only after having me wait and sharing that she too was having technical difficulties im  sure she also called me dude at some point during this conversation but i can only hope i misheard her so were done now im ready to hang up i have supposedly well find out paid my balance right before saying goodbye she chimes to me remember that in the future you can always review your balance and pay your bill onlinewell obviously i cant because it doesnt workhave a nice day maam and let me direct you

been paying my bill on time at this address for  years now im stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend terrible customer service especially for a utility that the public

the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that i have ever dealt with  you cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people  having problems with your meter they tell you to plan to wait all daywant a meter moved they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduledwant to talk to a scheduler for either  they are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themwhen they came to move the meter they told me i needed a new line from the meter to the street  this is an expense they need to incur i have never heard back from themwithout question the ceo of washington gas should be the next ceo of united airlines because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers was this review … useful funny cool james j washington dc  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow james j stop following james j  this place would

arlington va  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow bryan c stop following bryan c  i hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about washington gasmeticulously review your bills  after my first bill their autopay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills  since i have never experienced issues before in  years of using autopay for utilities i didnt look at the bills posted on my washington gas account online  it wasnt until washington gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that i signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that autodraft was not working  my mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent  then they added a  deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered late even though the lateness was due to their autopay system failure  fine whateverthereafter i opted out of autopay and manually paid each bill online each month  interestingly the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history  they took my money but never credited my account i called customer service for an explanation the representative agreed that she saw the payments but i wasnt getting credited in the bills  she forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in  days  i asked why doesnt she just transfer me to that department while i was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process which takes two weeks to complete  wowi am moving out of the country in about a week so i imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the  deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while im overseasill leave you with one positive the customer service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system  when scheduling a stop date for my service it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over  minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address  they must be using tandy computers
