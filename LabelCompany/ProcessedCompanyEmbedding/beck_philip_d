incorporated herein by reference this application claims priority on us application no  filed on jun   which is also incorporated herein by referencebackground of the inventionthis invention relates to telephonebased commerce and in particular to a telephonebased system and method which facilitates voiceconducted commerce transactions over existing telephone networkselectronicbased commerce also known as ecommerce permits users to conduct business transactions and shopping with at least some electronic communications either through computer text entry or through voice commands for example us pat nos      and  describe systems which provide users with the capability of conducting voice commerce vcommerce by entering voice commands for conducting business transactionsother known systems provide users with electronic access to accounts as described in us patent application publication numbers us  a us  and us  a such known ecommerce and vcommerce systems have had limited applicability to provide an integrated and comprehensive system for facilitating consumer transactionsimprovements in speech technology have led to the growth of the use of speech applications particularly among large companies despite improvements in speech application standards and development tools expectations to easily and affordably proliferate speech applications are as yet unfulfilled fortune  organizations have moved over the past year to new web based telephony platforms and speech enabled traditional interactive voice response ivr applications in an effort to improve service automated speech applications that provide for a return on investment roi through reduced personnel costs are emerging companies now have a choice of rollyourown systems hosted systems or some combination from any number of known vendors in the marketplacesmall and medium business smb organizations have yet to significantly deploy speech applications smbs lack the resources to design a speech application and its interface to record professional voice talents and to monitor and tune a voice system to address high upfront costs vendors such as angel apptera datria fluency harborlight and metaphor solutions offer prepackaged generic applications that can be tailored secondly free voicexml starter platforms and online toolkits are available from tellme be vocal and voxeo and other free toolkits from “ibm corporation” can be utilized at little or no cost thirdly ibm has donated reusable dialogue components to the public for a javabased environment these components perform functions and dynamically generate voicexml code when they runnumerous vendors are used by large companies that offer voice platforms which include standards such as voicexml andor speech engines to implement speech applicationsadditionally major vendors are active in this field whose strength in the market is as middleware providers such as “microsoft corporation” and “ibm corporation” some vendors are speech specialists which include support for standards including voicexml vendors such as nuance loquendo telisma and upcoming competitors from countries such as china and others focus on the speech enginesvendors such as tuvox that come to market with strengths in hosted and managed solutions are used by large and smaller companies in some cases these are hybrid premiseservice offerings built on voicexml and ip networks vendors offering this type of solution include carriers such as att or mci contact center outsourcers such as convergys or west corporation and voice response services such as tellme networkshowever despite such developments in ivr the reality of linking payment cards such as credit cards debit cards andor prepaid cards to cell phones has not been substantially or fully realized in the united states a number of banking and financial institutions are testing the idea and hope to roll out similar products in the future such as operating with the “paypal” payment system commercially available from “ebay inc” as well as obopay textpayme and mobilelime in addition radio frequency identification rfid wireless projects that use the phone as a card such as ezpass are driven by banks and credit card companiesus trials are in place such as one which allows existing customers of “jpmorgan chase  company” to pay at philips arena in atlanta via a telephone device with an embedded chip most cell phones do not include the nearfield communication nfc chip but cell phone manufacturers are moving towards this capability and it is expected that half of all phones will have the nfc chip by there are numerous deployed text based mobile payment applications outside of the united states in addition to a number of mobile phone solutions with integrated swipe capability which have been available and appear to be moving towards additional nonswipe solutionsanother area related to mobile speech is multimodal applications which more closely tie the phones speech and visual processing multimodal capability has the potential for implementation but not fully for the next few years because of network constraints which are better addressed in g mobile networks to which the united states is now moving also a majority of phones are not capable of supporting two simultaneous channels with just one for speech and one for visualshowever the existing systems fail to provide a speech application that complements a core payment processing business and influences banks and other key partners to conduct such electronic business and commercein addition known ecommerce systems such as internet and webbased commercial applications are typically visually based and so are disadvantageous for people with limited or no sight besides such users who have limited or no sight other potential users such as young people sometimes referred to as “genyers” routinely use telephones and in particular cell phones as opposed to using personal computers pc and pcbased internet browsers furthermore potential users such as the relatively old or relatively poor may lack the ability familiarity comfort level and financial resources to use traditional computerbased ecommerce and cannot conduct ecommerce based on such visual as well as tactile operations of prior art computers for example using the mouse and browsers interacting with ecommerce websites on the internet such genyers older users and relatively poor users may be more readily familiar with and comfortable with using telephones and so such users would more readily use telephonebased systems to successfully conduct commerce through voice commandsan integrated vcommerce system with automated payment methods would be advantageous to facilitate commercial activities by groups of people having a greater affinity to using telephones than using pcbased ecommerce facilities such as people with limited or no sight and young people including genyers as well as the elderly and the poorsummary of
