from our experts the decision to go public whether traditional ipo or miniipo is a mosaic of many factors business does the business provide a unique service or product that doesn’t have direct competitors if the business has publicly traded competitors what makes it unique cost structure eg more efficient manufacturing differentiated geographic footprint size  scale does the company currently have size and scale if no is there an opportunity and plan to reach a sufficient size to be meaningful for institutional investors rational use of proceeds additional capital required to grow employee recruitment and retention company readiness adequacy of internal financial reporting and accounting controls sarbanesoxley shortterm and longterm business outlook financial performance trends and metrics for valuation predictability of operations and confidence in projections management readiness quality and depth of management team public company experience
