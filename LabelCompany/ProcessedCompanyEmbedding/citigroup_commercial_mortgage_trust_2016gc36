aaa sf cl as affirmed aa sf previously on feb   definitive rating assigned aa sf cl xa affirmed aa sf previously on feb   definitive rating assigned aa sf ratings rationale the ratings on the seven pi classes were affirmed because the transactions key metrics including moodys loantovalue ltv ratio moodys stressed debt service coverage ratio dscr and the transactions herfindahl index herf are within acceptable ranges the rating on the io class class xa was affirmed based on the credit performance or the weighted average rating factor or warf of its referenced classes moodys rating action reflects

httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool loan concentration an increase in realized and expected losses from specially

the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  the same as at

interestonly class ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixed rate mortgage loans secured by  mortgaged properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x but lower than other conduitfusion transactions rated by moodys during  the moodys stressed dscr is x which is lower than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the pooled trust loan balance of  million represents a moodys ltv ratio of  which is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  and higher than most pools securitized during  there are two loans in the pool with subordinate debt in the form of mezzanine debt with the subordinate debt the moodys total debt ltv ratio rises to  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is better than the average score calculated for other rated by moodys rated conduit pools since  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score is  the transactions loan level diversity profile is lower than the scores calculated for most multiborrower pools that moodys has rated since  with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is  this deal is structured with supersenior aaa sf classes having  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the carved out class as certificate which immediately supports the supersenior classes if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis relative to moodys idealized aaa sf loss target thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduit fusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf classes would be aaa aa and a respectively for the currently rated aa sf class aa a and baa respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently

analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based
