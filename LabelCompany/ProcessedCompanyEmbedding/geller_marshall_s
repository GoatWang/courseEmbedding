jvs steven page november   news jvs honors marshall s geller with lifetime achievement award steven page november   news with more than  people in attendance at the sls hotel jvs honored marshall geller the cofounder and managing partner of st cloud capital with its lifetime achievement awardpresenting the award was business leader motivational speaker and bestselling author chris gardner gardner overcame homelessness and the challenges of being a single parent to chase his dream of being a stockbroker geller the senior managing director of bear stearns  co at the time gave gardner one of his first shots at success in the world of financegardner chronicled his story in  autobiography “the pursuit of happyness” which inspired the box office hit starring will smith  in introducing geller gardner said that his own achievements would not have been possible had geller not opened a door for him“because i got the opportunity to work in this magical place called bear stearns given to me by you it didn’t just change my life it changed the lives of my children” gardner said  “there’s a health clinic being built in small village in ghana right now that will service  people because you gave me the opportunity  years ago marshall i could never thank you enough”gardner’s story resonates particularly strongly with jvs where the agency assists more than  clients per year – many of them longterm unemployed who are facing substantial barriers – to improve their livesduring his acceptance remarks geller acknowledged the work of jvs and stressed the importance of supporting the agency he cited a chinese proverb which states that the key to a lifetime of happiness is in helping people“i had heard about the wonderful work jvs and i ultimately had the chance to visit one of their worksource centers and met some of their clients” geller said “that’s when i really saw firsthand the impact of their efforts”“i would implore you to set up a meeting and visit with a jvs staff person at the worksource centers” he continued  “trust me you will see some wonderful things and i think you will want to be more involved with the agency”the event hosted by frequent “tonight show” guest tom dreesen also included a screening of the jvs video “finding hope jvs in action” ibrahim brewer a former us marine who received assistance through jv’s veterans first program was a featured

the morning and working a retail job during the afternoons and evenings geller signed on with merrill lynch after graduating collegeafter six months at merrill lynch geller left the world of finance borrowed  from a local bank and created an import company that conducted business across the far east despite his insistence that he was happy and thriving in his new career geller was recruited by a longtime colleague larry friend to join the firm of kleiner bell because as friend insisted “you’re a stockbroker”a dubious geller insisted that he had quit the field of finance but was willing to listen to the offer  after friend wooed geller for two months including a recruiting trip to new york geller went back to wall street less than a month into his tenure at kleiner bell the firm shut down leaving geller and friend out of workmore breaks were in store feeling responsible for the situation they were both in friend insisted geller accompany him to interviews in new york geller found himself in discussion with bear stearns ceo alan greenberg geller believed that friend was the target hire but greenberg convinced him that he was an important recruit as well the firm greenberg explained didn’t hire phds instead they looked for “psds”  individuals who were poor smart and had a deep desire to become successfulgreenberg considered geller a prime psd and hired him many years later as a top executive at bear stearns geller would recognize the same psd qualities in chris gardner“every time i see chris i’m overwhelmed by his accomplishments in the world both in business and as a humanitarian” geller said “all chris was asking for all those years ago was a chance to work now multiply his story and his personal impact on the world by the  years jvs has been helping people in need multiply that effect by the tens of thousands of lives jvs has changed since ”during his more than  years in corporate finance and investment banking geller oversaw bear stearns’ offices in
