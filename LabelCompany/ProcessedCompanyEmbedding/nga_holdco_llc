presentation and principles of consolidation the company prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiaries blocker and acquisitionco all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments all of which are normal and recurring necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of september   and december   and the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended september   and  and its cash flows for the nine months ended september   and  the results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the company’s form k for the year ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission on april   cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value investment in eldorado         the company accounts for its  investment in eldorado using the equity method of accounting the company considers on a quarterly basis whether the fair value of its equity method investment has declined below its carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value may not be recoverable if the company considers any such decline to be other than temporary then a writedown would be recorded to estimated fair value evidence of a loss in value that may be other than temporary might include but would not necessarily be limited to absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the company’s investment or the inability of eldorado to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment in evaluating whether the loss in value is other than temporary the company considers  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and nearterm prospects of eldorado including any specific events which may influence the operations of eldorado  the company’s intent and ability to retain its investment in eldorado for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value  the condition and trend of the economic cycle  eldorado’s financial performance and projections  trends in the general market and  eldorado’s capital strength and liquidity in determining whether the fair value of the investment in eldorado is less than its carrying value the company uses a discounted cash flow model as its principal technique the company’s model incorporates an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital that a market participant would use in evaluating the investment in a purchase transaction the estimated weightedaverage cost of capital is based on the risk free interest rate and other factors such as current risk premiums the company uses the discounted cash flow model as it provides greater detail and opportunity to reflect specific facts circumstances and economic conditions for its investment comparable business transactions are often limited in number the information can be dated and often require significant adjustments due to differences in the size of the business markets served and other factors the company therefore believes that in its        table of contents nga holdco llc notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited—continued   circumstance this makes comparisons to business transactions less reliable than the discounted cash flows model however the company does consider comparable business transactions as a reasonableness test of our principal technique in performing this impairment test the company takes steps to ensure that appropriate and reasonable cash flow projections and assumptions are used the company also performs sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions used including the weightedaverage cost of capital fair value of financial instruments the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued “fair value measurements and disclosure topic ” which clarified the disclosure requirements of existing us gaap related to fair value measurements this standard requires additional disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements as follows  for transfers in and out of level  and level  fair value measurements as those terms are currently defined in existing authoritative literature a reporting entity is required to disclose the amount of the movement between levels and an explanation for the movement  for activity at level  primarily fair value measurements based on unobservable inputs a reporting entity is required to present separately information about purchases sales issuances and settlements as opposed to presenting such transactions on a net basis  in the event of a disaggregation a reporting entity is required to provide fair value measurement disclosure for each class of assets and liabilities and  a reporting entity is required to provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for items that fall in either level  or level  these disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level  fair value measurements for which disclosure becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years this standard did not impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of and for the quarter ended september   in addition certain amendments to accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “consolidation” became effective for us beginning january   such amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” an enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie by evaluating whether  the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the vie that have a significant effect on economic performance and  the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the amendments to asc  also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements as of september    membership units and related rights the company’s operating agreement has created two classes of membership units the
