naltrexone an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence when this product is taken as intended the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed if the multiparticulate beads are crushed or dissolved the opioid antagonist naltrexone is designed to release the absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers  we filed an nda for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology immediate release oxycodone mg mg mg mg and mg with sequestered naltrexone collectively and individually referred to as sequestox on january   on july   the fda issued a complete response letter or crl regarding the nda the crl stated that the review cycle for the sequestox nda is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form on december   the company met with the fda for an endofreview meeting to discuss steps that the company can take to obtain approval of sequestox based on the fda response the company believes there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the crl the meeting minutes received from the fda on january   supported a plan to address the issues cited by the fda in the crl by modifying the sequestox formulation the company plans on proceeding immediately with the in vitro and in vivo studies required and expects to resubmit the sequestox application later this year the in vivo studies include bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation please note that there can be no assurances of the company receiving marketing authorization for sequestox and accordingly there can be no assurances that the company will earn and receive the additional  million or future license fees if the company does not receive these payments or fees it will materially and adversely affect our financial condition on

received and the product is commercialized there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits in such amounts that would provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure marketing authorization for this product the company believes that the abuse deterrent technology can be applied to and incorporated into a wide range of opioids used today for pain management and has to date identified  additional products for potential development all of these products are at early stages of development with research and development activities mainly consisting of inhouse process development and laboratory studies extensive efficacy and safety studies similar to those conducted for sequestox generic oxyapap and generic hydrocodoneapap have not yet been conducted for these other products as a result costs incurred in relation to the development of these  products have not been material research and development costs were  million and  million for the three months ended december   and  respectively and  million and  million for the nine months ended december   and  respectively costs incurred during the prior fiscal year relate almost entirely to the development of the abuse deterrent opioid product sequestox and costs incurred during the current fiscal year relate almost entirely to the development of the abuse deterrent opioid products sequestox generic oxyapap and generic hydrocodoneapap on june   the company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement which included a nonrefundable payment of  million to elite for prior research and development activities with such representing the first material net cash inflows being generated by eli on january   the company filed an nda with the fda for sequestox thereby earning a nonrefundable  million milestone an additional  million nonrefundable milestone is due upon the fdas approval of elites nda please note as further detailed above there can be no assurances of the company receiving marketing authorization for sequestox and accordingly there can be no assurances that the company will earn and receive the additional  million or future license fees the nonreceipt by the company of these payments and or fees may materially and adversely affect our financial condition please note that while the fda is required to review applications within certain timeframes during the review process the fda frequently requests that additional information be submitted the effect of such request and subsequent submission can significantly extend the time for the nda review process until an nda is actually approved there can be no assurances that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the fda to justify approval the packaging and labeling of our developed products are also subject to fda regulation based on the foregoing it is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain fda approval to market any product in addition there can be no assurances of the company filing the required applications with the fda or of the fda approving such applications if filed and the companys ability to successfully develop and commercialize products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level of risk as detailed in item arisk factorsrisks related to our business of the annual report on form k filed with the sec on june   and further detailed in item arisk factors in this quarterly report on form q abusedeterrent and sustained release opioids the abusedeterrent opioid products utilize our patented abusedeterrent technology that is based on a pharmacological approach these products are combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with pain and an antagonist formulated to deter abuse of the drug both agonist and antagonist have been on the market for a number of years and sold separately in various dose strengths we have filed inds for two abuse resistant products under development and has tested products in various pharmacokinetic studies we expect to continue to develop multiple abuse resistant products products utilizing the pharmacological approach to deter abuse such as suboxone a product marketed in the united states by reckitt benckiser pharmaceuticals inc and embeda a product marketed in the united states by pfizer inc have been approved by the fda and are being marketed in the united states  we have developed and retain the rights to these abuse resistant and sustained release opioid products we may license these products at a later date to a third party who could provide funding for the remaining clinical studies and who could provide sales and distribution for the product we also developed controlled release technology for oxycodone under a joint venture with elan which terminated in  according to the elan termination agreement we acquired all proprietary development and commercial rights for the worldwide markets for the products developed by the joint venture including the sustained release opioid products upon licensing or commercialization of an oral controlled release formulation of oxycodone for the treatment of pain we will pay a royalty to elan pursuant to the elan termination agreement if we were to sell the product itself we will pay a  royalty to elan based on the products net sales and if we enter into an agreement with another party to sell the product we will pay a  royalty to elan based on our net revenues from this product we are allowed to recoup all development costs including research process development analytical development clinical development and regulatory costs before payment of any royalties to elan patents since our incorporation we have secured the following patents of which two have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company our patents are patent expiration date us patent  assigned to celgene corporation november  us patent  october  us patent  assigned to celgene corporation march  us patent  april  us patent  april  us patent  april  us patent  april  canadian patent  april  canadian patent  september  us patent  june  we also have pending applications for two additional us patents and three foreign patents we intend to apply for patents for other products in the future however there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications or other applications which we may file will be granted we have also filed corresponding foreign applications for key patents prior to the enactment in the united states of new laws adopting certain changes mandated by the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the exclusive rights afforded by a us patent were for a period of  years measured from the date of grant under gatt the term of any us patent granted on an application filed subsequent to june   terminates  years from the date on which the patent application was filed in the united states or the first priority date whichever occurs first future patents granted on an application filed before june   will have a term that terminates  years from such date or  years from the date of grant whichever date is later under the drug price competition act a us product patent or use patent may be extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the patent holder for the time required for fda regulatory review of the product such benefits under the drug price competition act are available only to the first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be applied only to one patent per drug product there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of this law also different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others there can be no assurance therefore that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country furthermore even if our patents are determined to be valid enforceable and broad in scope there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology trademarks sequestox is a trademark owned by elite which received a notice of allowance by the united states patent and trademark office on december    we currently plan to license at least some of our products to other entities in the marketing of pharmaceuticals but may also sell products under our own brand name in which case we may register trademarks for those products sources and availability of raw materials manufacturing a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad including  greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems  the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies  interim price volatility based on labor unrest materials or equipment shortages export duties restrictions on the transfer of funds or fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights while we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over  suppliers some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers the fda requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products if raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier fda approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved we have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our products we have registered our facilities with the fda and the dea dependence on one or a few major customers each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large percentage of our limited revenues therefore the termination or restructuring of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of material amount or substantially all of our revenues we are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new customers but despite these efforts we may not at the time that any of our current contracts expire have other contracts in place generating similar or material revenue we have agreements with epic precision dose and ascend for the licensing sales and distribution of products that we manufacture we are currently renegotiating a licensing contract with epic which may result in the termination of an existing contract or an amended licensing contract that is materially different from that already in place we receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split or royalties based on inmarket sales of the products critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap and our discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note   summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this quarterly report on form q describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material results of operations the following set forth our

timing of generic product shipments manufacturing fees increased by  million or  due to timing of generic product shipments licensing fees decreased by  million or  this decrease is primarily due to the timing of inmarket sales of the companys generic products as well as margins achieved by the companys licensed marketing partners license fees earned are based on inmarket sales and accordingly there is a natural lag between manufacturing revenues earned by the company and related license fees being earned from in market sales occurring subsequent to the companys shipment of licensed generic products to its marketing partners in market profits achieved by the companys marketing partners are also a factor with a direct correlation to the license fee revenues earned by the company costs of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs our costs of revenue increased by  million or  to  million as compared to  million for the corresponding period in  the increase in costs of revenue is primarily due to increased and continued investments in companys facility and resources leading to higher overhead absorption rates our gross profit margin was  during the three months ended december   as compared to  during the three months ended december   the decrease in gross margin is due to the product mix of generics manufactured during the quarter combined with higher

into licensing manufacturing and development agreements which may include multiple revenue generating activities including without limitation milestones licensing fees product sales and services these multiple elements are assessed in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  multipleelement arrangements in order to determine whether particular components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting an arrangement component is considered to be a separate unit of accounting if the deliverable relating to the component has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in control of the company the company recognizes payments received pursuant to a multiple revenue agreement as revenue only if the related delivered items have standalone value with the arrangement being accordingly accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if such delivered items are considered to either not have standalone value the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the payments received are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when performance obligations relating to the items will be performed whenever the company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting it determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized if it cannot reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete its performance obligations under a multipleelement arrangement revenues are then recognized on a straightline basis over the period encompassing the expected completion of such obligations with such period being reassessed at each subsequent reporting period arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method when applying the relative selling price method the selling price of each deliverable is determined using vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price if such exists otherwise thirdpart evidence of selling price if neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable the company uses its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method in deciding whether we can determine vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence of selling price the company does not ignore information that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort when determining the selling price for significant deliverables under a multipleelement revenue arrangement the company considers any or all of the following without limitation depending on information available or information that could be reasonably available

payments are accounted for in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  milestone method for any deliverables or units of accounting under which the company must achieve a defined performance obligation which is contingent upon future events or circumstances that are uncertain as of the inception of the arrangement providing for such future milestone payment determination of the substantiveness of a milestone is a matter of subjective assessment performed at the inception of the arrangement and with consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meeting all of the following it must be either commensurate with the companys performance in achieving the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the companys performance to achieve the milestone and it relates solely to past performance and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement collaborative arrangements contracts are considered to be collaborative arrangements when they satisfy the following criteria defined in asc  collaborative arrangements the parties to the contract must actively participate in the joint operating activity and the joint operating activity must expose the parties to the possibility of

fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer but what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more

of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma report   related news report medicines in development for

medicine the promise of personalized medicine share tweet link email print phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized while the science has never been more complex the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality to learn more about the promise of
