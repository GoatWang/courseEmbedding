of silicon valley by randall stross august    am august    am randall stross the digital domain columnist for the new york times has been following y combinator the silicon valley startup incubator for more than a year his book “the launch pad inside y combinator silicon valley’s most exclusive school for startups” will be published next month by portfoliopenguin he got a rare insider look at all of the incubator’s fledgling startups in robotics mobile apps ecommerce services and software for companies here is his exhaustive but not exhausting special report for bits on the current crop of companies y combinator has produced peer through the window of a hospital nursery and you see rows and rows of cute babies i think newborn startups possess the same kind of cheekpinching appeal and nowhere can you find as large a collection of startups in a single place as those that come out of y combinator the mountain view calif seed fund on tuesday yc as insiders call it staged its th semiannual demo day for investors sixtythree of the summer batch’s companies made a formal public presentation to investors and the press that’s a lot of newborns the demo day format hasn’t changed much as yc has grown over the years attracting ever larger numbers of applications and funding larger batches of startups the purpose of the exercise is to give investors a tantalizing tidbit or two of information sufficient for determining whether to have the conversations that may eventually lead to an investment each presentation lasts just two or two and a half minutes is filled with astounding figures “a  billion market” comes in thematically random order and is stacked one on top of the other in a blur eleven more presentations came at the end that were designated offtherecord sure some of the babies appear to be a bit cuter than the others but all deserve a chance to make their way what can be done immediately is view the group portrait yc’s summer  batch captures prevailing startup ideas in one moment in time a little more than half of the startups that presented are attempting to sell to business customers let’s start however with the startups that are consumer oriented many are fledgling media businesses built upon usergenerated content we users apparently have very short attention spans the humor site gag  which serves up silly memes found by users — and draws  million unique users a month — says “bite size is the future of entertainment” reelsurfer lets users reduce a video clip which may already be short to extremely short length for more conventional entertainment there is mars frontier a massively multiplayer realtime strategy game the first game produced by spinpunch what is not so conventional at least not yet is the use of html which requires no download as flashbased games do tapin which like many of its batchmates incorporates the twin motifs of mobile and social is a mobile video app designed for a speedy start kamcord also is in social and mobile entertainment mobile game developers are invited to use its software so that gamers can record and share their gameplay another company makes the coco controller a smartphone case that has physical buttons for use with mobile games that are written to work with the case circular applies the social theme to news letting one’s friends act as a filter or for those who would like to not have the social overlay on everything one does there’s everydayme an iphone app that “captures all your life moments” but whose default setting is private not to be shared with others there is some playful experimentation with communication visitors to voicegem’s web site can record a voice message that is sent to an email address rather than a phone number hubchilla matches users up with strangers to have conversations via texting but keeps the participants’ phone numbers hidden one of its cofounders who is a  under  thiel fellow said he began coding at the age of  tablets receive the focused attention of grid which makes a spreadsheet that does some tricks that no spreadsheet on a pc could ever match amid the fascination with mobile the web has not disappeared completely however for sharing favorite images found on the web there’s imgfave for favorite links with the pitch addressed to office workers in particular there’s kippt for finding stuff of our own that is stored in google docs collections provides a “finder for the cloud” no fewer than four of the startups in the batch provide travelrelated services flightfox runs contests in which travel agents and other humans compete to find the lowest fare for international or multicity flights or travelers can use getgoing which describes itself as “the nextgeneration priceline” it supplies a deeply discounted fare for leisure travelers who are willing to agree to go to either of two separate destinations — but cannot choose which one it is vayable offers unusual travel experiences bringing travelers and independent guides together tomoguides is preparing smartphone city guides that will be offered free like vayable other startups are creating an online marketplace bringing together suppliers and customers and offering prices lower than those available using existing middlemen in the physical world tastemaker does the same for interior designers and customers registrylove works with existing merchants but is attempting to create a consolidated wedding registry that spans all stores healthy labs a startup hosting what it calls “patient social networks” for chronic diseases has begun with a site for those with crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis crohnology in education knowmia has set up a site that invites teachers to contribute video lessons what the company describes as “a crowdsourced khan academy” studyedge offers college students study guides video content and live review sessions that address challenging courses at particular universities it’s now available at the university of florida the personal finance category of software is an old one smartasset a webbased service applies its own analytical engine to the category which supplies customized answers to users’ questions like how much house can one afford instacart is an intrepid startup that has entered another old category one known for the notorious failure of early pioneers webbased grocery ordering its founder stressed that it carried no inventory unlike the infamous failure webvan “we’re entirely software” a category of software with a much shorter history is that for d printers dreamforge lets users create a customized design for a threedimensional superhero that the company will print — that is manufacture — then send back to the customer the blend of the physical and the digital is also found in vastrm a web site that offers customized shirts including a “home tryon program” similar to what warby parker offers for eyeglasses vastrm’s founder received one of the loudest appreciative laughs of the day when he pointed to warby parker’s success and remarked “not everyone wears glasses but everyone wears a shirt” suppose you’re not home when ups tries to deliver your dreamforge superhero or vastrm polo shirt to your apartment someday you may live close to a bufferbox location each with a box containing multiple parcel lockers that are controlled through software bufferbox is rolling out its initial boxes in toronto the remaining startups in this summer batch are pitching to the enterprise or to fellow software developers some services are

eliminating the expense of placing and fielding phone calls between humans hiptype teams up with ebook publishers embedding its software in the books to gather data for what it calls “datadriven book publishing” if the business is one in which individuals outside the company send in documents that must then be reviewed — résumés grant applications college applications — there’s a yc company that handles the process submittable parallel universe supplies a database service for businesses or organizations that manage vast amounts of spatial data in real time like the israeli air force an early customer amicus seeks to profit from helping nonprofits replace inefficient fundraising using old means like mail appeals and cold calls with social media friends referring friends finance with its large it budgets has attracted bigcalc which does fast simulations for quants and algo traders and datanitro which weds python financial and math libraries to excel spreadsheets fundersclub wants to be “the future nasdaq” matching accredited investors with tech startups coinbase offers a way for nontechnical users to get started with bitcoin the digital currency many of the startups that are selling to the enterprise aim at customers that belong to no particular industry microeval seeks to move performance reviews to the cloud statwing supplies easy “data visualization” to nontechnical people working with spreadsheets quicklychat is a video chat service for coworkers that the company claims is easy to use but will not interrupt the work of the person who is asked to respond because of the software’s “intelligent availability detection” small and mediumsize businesses that need a customized phone system can turn to profig for warehouse management there’s hd trade services’

looking at what other apps are installed on a phone this company holds what i believe must be the day’s record for largest figure mentioned —  trillion — a reference to the number of inapp ads that the company says will appear in  we come to the last category of startups in the batch the one that is by far the largest tools and services for software developers yc has always attracted strong technical teams and no one knows better than developers and designers themselves what they need this batch has light table an interactive programming development that had raised more than  on
