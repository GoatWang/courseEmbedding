allelectric version of its ioniq hatchback alongside the conventional hybrid and plugin hybrid versions of that model called the ioniq electric it has an estimated driving range of  miles eparated range of  miles dont miss  hyundai ioniq product team discusses us hybrid electric markets unfortunately the ioniq electric will arrive just as an anticipated new crop of mainstreampriced mile electric cars—led by the mile  chevrolet bolt ev—will start to appear at us dealers but hyundai is already planning a response to that trend it seems it plans to launch a version of the ioniq electric with at least  miles of range by  reports industry trade journal automotive news subscription required  hyundai ioniq electric european spec  geneva motor showenlarge photo thats what ahn byungki—director of hyundais ecovehicle performance group—said during a recent media event at the carmakers michigan technical center ahn said the current range will satisfy most consumers typical needs but that it still is not enough for the long term a range in the neighborhood of the  miles would allow the ioniq electric to compete with the bolt ev as well as the mile tesla model  which tesla says will start production at the end of next year also see  hyundai ioniq preview the nextgeneration nissan leaf is also expected to have at least one version with a mile range it will likely be unveiled and launched sometime over the next  months to replace the current leaf which has a mile range ahn did not specify how hyundai will increase the ioniq electrics range but fitting a battery pack with a significantly larger form factor could pose a challenge  hyundai ioniq european spec  geneva motor showenlarge photo thats because—rather than putting a flat battery pack under the passenger compartment floor as in a leaf or chevy bolt ev—hyundai sited its battery under the rear seat and between the rear wheels its possible one hyundai executive hinted last year that it might extend the pack into the tunnel between the ioniqs seats otherwise increasing battery capacity by twothirds would require lithiumion cells with energy density that is twothirds greater a tall order for any cell supplier even given recent improvements in cell capacity more hyundai ioniq hybrid sets new land speed record hyundai says the ioniq electric and ioniq hybrid models will go on sale before the end of this year while the plugin hybrid will follow in  at the  los angeles auto show hyundai also announced amazon alexa smarthome integration which includes the ability to start and stop

already encouraging large numbers of visitors to engage with this highly poignant landscape of war and to commemorate the sacrifice and loss of a previous generation interest is also being sharpened in the places of war as battlesites trenchsystems bunkers and mine craters gain a clearer identity as war heritage for the first time this book brings together the three strands of heritage landscape and tourism to provide a fresh understanding of the multilayered nature of the western front the book approaches the area as a rich dynamic landscape which can be viewed in a startling variety of ways historically materially culturally and perceptually to illustrate these two dominant interpretations of the regions landscape  commemorative and heritage  are highlighted and their relationship to tourism explored tourism is a lens through which these layers can be peeled away and each understood and interacted with according to the individuals own knowledge motivation and degree of emotional engagementtourism is not regarded here as a passive phenomenon but as an active agent that can determine dictate and inscribe this evocative landscape the western front heritage landscape and tourism is a timely addition to our increasing interest in the first world war and the places where it was fought it will be indispensable to those who seek a deeper understanding of the conflict from
