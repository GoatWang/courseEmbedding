cutter block is easy to clean with the brush when you’re done switch the shaver on fort wo or three seconds careful never ever clean the cutter foil with the brush cleaning with the cleaning spray the cleaning spray helps clean your shaver thoroughly removing all traces of sebum after spraying both cutter parts the soaked residues are easy to remove  maintaining for  performance replace all cutter
