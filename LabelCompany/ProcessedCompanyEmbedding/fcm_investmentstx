business and solid management not by how well known the company is quality assets whether municipal bonds or growth stocks must be bought well at a discount to their inherent value this requires the discipline to determine a true sense of the fair value of the asset doing our own research gives us the conviction to be contrarian at key junctures — willing to buy when others pass willing to sell an investment that has become overly popular and willing to hold an attractive security through a volatile period our approach leads to low portfolio turnover which is generally more tax efficient
