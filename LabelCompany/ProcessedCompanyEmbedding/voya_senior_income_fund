fees brokerage commissions taxes or other expenses of investing investors cannot invest directly in an index principal risks the fund invests primarily in below investmentgrade floating rate senior loans that carry a higher than normal risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their loans which would likely cause the value of the funds common shares to decrease changes in shortterm market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the funds common shares if such rates fall the funds yield will also fall if interest rate spreads on funds loans decline in general the yield on the funds loans will fall and the value of the funds loans may decrease when shortterm market interest rates rise because of the lag between changes in such shortterm rates and the resetting of the floating rates on loans in the funds portfolio the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag because of the limited secondary market for floating rate senior bank loans the funds ability to sell its loans in a timely fashion andor at a favorable price may be limited an increase in the demand for loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new loans acquired by the fund and it may also increase the price of loans purchased by the fund in the secondary market a decrease in the demand for loans may adversely affect the price of loans in the funds portfolio which would cause the funds nav to decrease the funds use of leverage through borrowings can adversely affect the yield on the funds common shares due to limited liquidity for investors the fund does not repurchase its shares on a daily basis and no market for the funds common shares is expected to exist if more than  of common shares are tendered in any month investors may not be able to completely liquidate their holdings in that month the fund may invest up to  of its assets in loans to borrowers in countries outside of the us and canada investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements differing legal systems and potential political social and economic adversity the fund may invest up to  of its assets in loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies however the fund will engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge as closely as practicable  of the economic impact

risks the fund invests primarily in below investmentgrade floating rate senior loans that carry a higher than normal risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their loans which would likely cause the value of the funds common shares to decrease changes in shortterm market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the funds common shares if such rates fall the funds yield will also fall if interest rate spreads on funds loans decline in general the yield on the funds loans will fall and the value of the funds loans may decrease when shortterm market interest rates rise because of the lag between changes in such shortterm rates and the resetting of the floating rates on loans in the funds portfolio the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag because of the limited secondary market for floating rate senior bank loans the funds ability to sell its loans in a timely fashion andor at a favorable price may be limited an increase in the demand for loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new loans acquired by the fund and it may also increase the price of loans purchased by the fund in the secondary market a decrease in the demand for loans may adversely affect the price of loans in the funds portfolio which would cause the funds nav to decrease the funds use of leverage through borrowings can adversely affect the yield on the funds common shares due to limited liquidity for investors the fund does not repurchase its shares on a daily basis and no market for the funds common shares is expected to exist if more than  of common shares are tendered in any month investors may not be able to completely liquidate their holdings in that month the fund may invest up to  of its assets in loans to borrowers in countries outside of the us and canada investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements differing legal systems and potential political social and economic adversity the fund may invest up to  of its assets in loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies however the fund will engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge as closely as practicable  of the economic impact to the fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations other risks of the fund include but are not
