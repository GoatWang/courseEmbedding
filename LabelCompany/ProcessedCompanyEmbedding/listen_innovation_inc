available only to registered visitors please complete the short form below all fields are required email  first name  last name  company  listen celebrates  years of innovation may  in company news by zarinalisten inc is proud to announce its th year as a leading provider of audio test and measurement systems and expertise two decades of innovation and steady growth have made listen’s flagship product soundcheck an industrystandard audio test system in the consumer electronics industry the company is commemorating the occasion with updated branding – a new more modern logo and a new website wwwlisteninccom listen began operations in  when a consulting client of steve temme company founder and president challenged him to build a computerbased system with the same capabilities as the hardware system that they currently owned this challenge came with a promise that if steve could produce the system within  months he would buy it steve met the challenge the product was named ‘soundcheck’ and the customer purchased  systems steve then began to further develop the product to meet the test requirements of a wider audience although the first generation of soundcheck was designed specifically for testing military headsets the next version was designed with a very open architecture which allowed virtually any audio device to be tested it is this open architecture which has in part led to listen’s success as the system has inherently been able to adapt to the changing test requirements of the audio industry over the past  decades for example in the ’s soundcheck was primarily used for testing loudspeaker and microphones but today its most common applications are testing headphones microspeakers smartphones tablets and bluetooth devices although listen has its roots firmly in software today listen also offers turnkey systems with a complete line of audio test hardware designed from the ground up listen’s hardware products are engineered to specifically meet the needs of the audio test industry thus making them reliable simple to use and cost effective as well as tightly integrated with listen’s software listen is still owned and managed by steve temme and is headquartered in an  square foot facility in the south end of boston within a mile of where the company started  years ago listen also has sales and application engineers on the west coast and a worldwide sales and support network listen is still growing steadily and has several open positions in both engineering and sales “we at listen inc are thankful to our many customers for making this anniversary possible” said steve temme president of listen inc “their feedback has driven product development and helped us evolve as a company we look forward to continuing to innovate with our products and test methods and to serving our valued customers for many years to come” you can learn more about listen’s ’ years of innovation’ by viewing our timeline

start but to really succeed as an entrepreneur you need to listen carefully to your customers by alex chriss alex chriss is the chief product officer small business group at intuit he focuses on serving the global population of independent contractors solopreneurs freelancers and selfemployed businesses of one and helped launch quickbooks selfemployed in january  acce chief product officer small business group at intuitacce write a comment credit getty images american entrepreneurship is booming an unprecedented  million americans count themselves among the selfemployed and generation y a fully digital generation is poised to become the most entrepreneurial generation ever with more small business comes more competition and both solopreneurs and startup founders will face increasing pressure in the marketplace to push the next big idea a great idea is a good start but its only that turning that great idea into a successful business for the longterm requires entrepreneurs to shift their focus from the merits of their ideas to the evidence they get from customer behavior the phrase the customer is king might be a cliche but it holds great wisdom for those creating products and services far too often entrepreneurs get swept up in their own ideas and forget to keep their eye on what really matters the customer consider some of the biggest product flops in recent memory they all had one thing in common the customers needs or preferences were all but forgotten take for example google glass in its quest to revolutionize the way we use computers google developed the product in a topsecret lab shielded not only from potential customers but also most google employees while google glass was admittedly an idea ahead of its time the customers still havent come around obtaining valuable customer feedback isnt just about sitting back and listening to customer complaints its about becoming actively engaged with the customer and finding ways to challenge your own assumptions based on the realworld input of customers here are three important lessons on customer feedback and engagement based on my own experiences  customers dont always tell you what they want in words often some of the most surprising insights can come from observing customer behavior two years ago my team at intuit noticed that  percent of mint users were hacking the personal finance product to categorize and track business expenses by creating an other categorya feature that hadnt been designed into the product we realized after talking with customers that we lacked a finance management product tailored to the needs of solopreneurs ie freelancers contractors businesses of one in response we built an entirely new product quickbooks selfemployed catering to this segment of individuals with unique financial needs compared to those of fullfledged small businesses  customers can help you fix impossible problems in many cases the solution to a difficult problem can be found in customer data shortly after launching quickbooks selfemployed customers complained that bank transactions in the product were limited to  days of history a bank requirement and they needed  months of data for tax purposes knowing that we needed more data to make this feature happen we asked customers to manually download data from banks and send it to us once we had a sufficient number of these files we could analyze them learn the myriad formats figure out how to grab the data ourselves and turn that intelligence into a feature developing the feature took just two weeks but it wouldnt have been possible if we hadnt obtained this essential customer data from our first scrappy iteration  what customers dont do can be equally important taking notice of what customers are not doing can help identify critical holes in your product offerings as well as the areas where opportunity is ripe for example my team saw that freelancers were missing out on approximately  billion in potential tax savings every year by not claiming all of the deductions available to them according to the united states government accountability office as a result we built a new feature called expensefinder that automatically found deductible business expenses helping customers get back money is a surefire way to make them happy some additional quick tips to help you on your product journey if you plan to monetize your product do it early its an easy way to see if youre creating real value before you go too far down the wrong path take the time to sit down with customers inperson at intuit we call these followmehomes customers are more likely to be frank and truthful when you meet with them in their own environment and facetoface and youll get important context thats often missing in surveys and polls have your entire product team especially those close to the product development process like engineers and designers take turns answering customer support questions talking to a real customer about a problem can be scary at first but solving for issues in realtime will energize your team and youll find its a powerful way to feel connected to the customer the opinions expressed
