investment approach and decisionmaking process that begins and ends with each client investing we take time to listen and fully understand each client’s situation before creating an investment program that reflects their distinctive goals objectives and risk tolerance we utilize securities from the major asset classes to tailor investment solutions that are as unique as our clients fixed income government bonds corporate bonds municipal bonds convertible bonds equities common stock convertible preferred stock within these broad asset classes we consider a wide range of opportunity small mid and large cap shares core growth and value stocks high yield as well as high quality bonds and nonus securities an expansive network of professional resources extends the range of solutions available to clients for whom exposure to nontraditional asset class portfolios make sense a commonsense philosophical foundation gives direction to each aspect of our investment decisionmaking process long term perspective a longerterm perspective focuses our attention on the factors driving longterm wealth creation…more in the long run security prices track closely with growth in earnings and cash flow in the short term quarterly earnings announcements world news rumors analyst recommendations program trading or short selling squeezes can trigger volatility in stock prices that have little to do with the underlying ability of a company to continue generating cash flow or its related underlying value we often use these price swings to our advantage but realize that the fundamental factors driving a company’s prospects over a longer time frame are generally more transparent and rational we therefore focus on a three to five year time horizon when assessing the investment potential of portfolio candidates and prefer to measure our results over that time frame unconstrained investment  universe an unconstrained investment universe generates greater opportunity and insight…more many of our investment ideas are generated through research of economic and industry trends and the companies fulfilling the needs implied by such trends the industry ecosystem surrounding a trend typically contains numerous companies some companies are large some small some fast growing some not some have attractive business models unique abilities or intellectual property high profitability low capital requirements good growth prospects and some have poor business models if a manager studying the companies involved in an ecosystem is restricted to only large capitalization value stocks the manager may be limited to only the weakest players in the industry or even shut out in contrast a manager able to evaluate all types – large small new established growth value – will likely possess a stronger understanding of that entire ecosystem and thus have a greater chance of selecting those securities that will lead to greater returns multiple analytical  perspectives the rigorous application of multiple analytical perspectives creates a disciplined framework for evaluating all investment ideas…more the investment thesis for each potential holding is based upon our comprehensive analysis of a company’s opportunity from three perspectives trend the socioeconomic technology transition or supplydemand trends with the potential to support or undermine a company’s cash flow growth business model the package of strategic and operational attributes that allow a company to convert demand into positive cash flow and then defend and further enhance that growth valuation the worth of a company’s security visàvis the quality of the applicable trend and strength and sustainability of its business model the relative emphasis we place on one perspective versus another varies by investment program in our most conservative portfolios valuation is more important than trend while in our more aggressive portfolios the opposite is true moreover we seek a balance of the three perspectives that is appropriate to a specific company’s situation for example if a prospective investment that stands to benefit from a strong industry trend has a good but not outstanding business model we prefer a cheaper valuation on the other hand if we find another trend beneficiary with an exceptional business model we may be willing to accept a richer valuation independent research intensive “ontheground” research and forwardlooking analysis leads us to an uncommon concept of risk…more many in the investment industry particularly those adhering to a ‘stylebox’ eg large cap value or small cap growth approach define risk as a variance of portfolio returns from those of a widely accepted benchmark for example a portfolio that has a steady but moderate rate of return would be uncorrelated to a market benchmark whose returns are volatile and over time lower than the portfolio’s this lack of correlation is considered benchmark ‘risk’ by today’s standards and something to be avoided even though the portfolio’s return and volatility profile was better than the benchmark’s we define risk as a measure of the future not the past and our definition of risk is companyspecific our risk management approach revolves around the two fundamental dimensions every company and stock face in its lifetime enterprise or business risk and valuation or price risk enterprise risk is the risk of a business underperforming or failing resulting in a permanent loss of capital valuation risk is the risk of paying too much now for future profit growth we focus on the current and future internal environmental and competitive factors that determine the level of enterprise and valuation risk a company embraces to determine the risks inherent in that company’s securities style and market cap  neutral an opportunistic approach to portfolio construction enhances the rewardrisk profile of client portfolios…more we construct styleagnostic portfolios with the securities of companies we believe most likely to generate returns consistent with our clients’ goals we let the rewardrisk profile of a potential investment not style or size characteristics be the limiting factor in our search for the best ideas portfolio holdings and position sizes reflect our perceptions of opportunity and risk not benchmark names or sector weights in our view managing to a benchmark is managing to a rearview mirror a benchmark’s highly weighted sectors reflect prior longterm outperformance not future outperformance prospects focused number of  holdings a focused number of portfolio holdings avoids overdiversification and enhances returns…more the number of stocks in a ppsg portfolio typically ranges between  and  and our interests generally keep us in at least five or six different sectors of the economy while some diversification is desirable for nearly all investment objectives once a portfolio contains about twenty stocks from a number of different industries the benefit of diversification has been achieved ie the impact of any one stock or industry on the performance of the total portfolio is limited moreover we believe that superior returns come from investing with insight and conviction portfolios of  to  names are focused on those opportunities in which we have strong conviction and the size of each position is large enough to impact performance the goal of our disciplined investment process is to optimize the balance between reward and risk in each client portfolio conducting our own research enhances our ability to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of individual securities the heart of our analytical work is a threepart lens through which we assess each investment idea trend will this company be the beneficiary of powerful and long lasting industry or economic growth trends business model how does this company make money how secure and sustainable is its competitive advantage valuation is this security overpriced has the market priced this security commensurate or less than our valuation this framework imposes a disciplined structure on our decisionmaking yet is sensitive to the varying characteristics of companies within our broad investment universe and to market trends our portfolio construction emphasizes the diversification of risk across the whole portfolio lastly we take time to communicate with our clients about what they own in their portfolios and why our job as advisor and investment manager isn’t complete until we’ve earned each client’s trust and confidence in our ability to secure their financial future the strongest trust is built on knowledge and transparency that’s why ppsg clients have a direct relationship with the professional making the investment decisions for their portfolio and its why we take the time to explain our thinking and actions return to top of pagecopyright   · sample child theme on genesis framework · wordpress · log in legal
