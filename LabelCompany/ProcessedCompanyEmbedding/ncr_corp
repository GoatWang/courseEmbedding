their strong purchasing power and influence with their parents these two groups are driving change in dining experiences as their tastes and expectations continue to evolve restaurants have a surefire way to connect with them technology young millennials and generation z grew up with total access to online information they don’t know a world without the internet or social media technology is a means to communicate not an escape as it has been for previous generations they use social media to share events in real time and they are willing to trade privacy for better experiences eating out is not a special event it is a social event it may be surprising to learn that  of millennials say technology factors into their choice of quickservice restaurants twentyeight percent say that technology factors into their choice of tableservice restaurants according to a  nra restaurant industry forecast according to the generational consumer trend report  of generation z consumers already eat out once a week they are digitally connected and they expect to be able to connect with everyone else in their world anytime they choose restaurants connect with these two groups by extending the dining experience outside the walls of their store here are a few ways they are using technology to engage with the younger generations selfserve ordering using a kiosk and digital table ordering fulfills young diners’ need for instant access and control over transactions innovative selfserve options save time help restaurants reduce the numbers of errors and combat rising labor costs going mobile diners want to be able to view menus online on a mobilefriendly website in fact  of guests use mobile devices to look up restaurant menus on a monthly basis going mobile allows restaurants to link ordering payments and loyalty programs creating a frictionless experience for guests payment options mobile payment options and tableside payment stations are gaining acceptance you can pay when you’re ready to leave which lead to quicker table turns and increased satisfaction revenue and tips according to the nra forecast  of consumers would pay with an app if it were available creating raving fans with loyalty programs more and more restaurants use mobile engagement to show they care for their reward program members emails and phone numbers provide a direct link to guests but guests will only read messages that are interesting and relevant the volume of data gathered when guests order online allows restaurants to send more personalized messages for example if ted enjoys a free strawberry milkshake with his meal on fridays a restaurant can send him an offer for a free milkshake with his meal once a month brand marketers can create invitations for a lunch regular to come back for a happy hour or dinner special customized messages endear guests and create raving fans engaging in social media it is vital that restaurants engage on social media onefourth of restaurant guests and  of millennials take photos of their meal to share recent data shows that  of guests shared positive reviews on social media vs  who shared negative feedback even if children are too young to drive to restaurants they are great influencers since a majority of their information comes from social media it is imperative to be a part of their online conversations according to the  nra restaurant industry forecast  of parents of gen zers choose restaurants based on their children’s suggestions keeping them connected restaurants are finding that offering free wifi plays a significant role in the restaurant choice of both millennials and generation z even though these guests are eating lunch with their friends they’ll still be communicating to their friends on their mobile devices

escape as it has been for previous generations they use social media to share events in real time and they are willing to trade privacy for better experiences eating out is not a special event it is a social event it may be surprising to learn that  of millennials say technology factors into their choice of quickservice restaurants twentyeight percent say that technology factors into their choice

digitally connected and they expect to be able to connect with everyone else in their world anytime they choose restaurants connect with these two groups by extending the dining experience outside the walls of their store here are a few ways they are using technology to engage with the younger generations selfserve ordering using a kiosk and digital table ordering fulfills young diners’ need for instant access and control over transactions innovative selfserve options save time help restaurants reduce the numbers of errors and combat rising labor costs going mobile diners want to be able to

programs creating a frictionless experience for guests payment options mobile payment options and tableside payment stations are gaining acceptance you can pay when you’re ready to leave which lead to

and more restaurants use mobile engagement to show they care for their reward program members emails and phone numbers provide a direct link to guests but guests will only read messages that are interesting and relevant the volume of data gathered when guests order online allows restaurants to send more personalized messages for example if ted enjoys a free strawberry milkshake with his meal on fridays a restaurant can send him an offer for a free milkshake with his meal once a month brand marketers can create invitations for a lunch regular to come back for a happy hour or dinner special customized messages endear guests and create raving fans engaging in social media it is vital that restaurants engage on social media onefourth of restaurant guests and  of millennials take photos of their meal to share recent data shows that  of guests shared positive reviews on social media vs  who shared negative feedback even if children are too young to drive to restaurants they are great influencers since a majority of their information comes from social media it is imperative to be a part of their online conversations according to the  nra restaurant industry forecast  of parents of gen zers choose restaurants based on their children’s suggestions keeping them connected restaurants are finding that offering free wifi plays a significant role in the restaurant choice of both millennials and generation z even though these guests are eating lunch with their friends they’ll still be communicating to their friends on their mobile devices restaurants who build strong

cash registers were expensive  usd and only about a dozen of rittys incorruptible cashier machines were in use there was little demand for the expensive device but patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks he created a sales team known as the american selling force which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script the ncr primer the philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery sales demonstrations were set up in hotels away from the distractions of the buyers business depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash the sale prospect was described as the pp or probable purchaser once initial objections were swept aside and the pp admitted to internal theft losses the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams the deal was sealed with a  cent cigar expansionedit ncr expanded quickly and became
