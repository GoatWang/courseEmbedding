sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble start printed page  march   pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on march   edgx exchange inc the “exchange” or “edgx” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has designated the proposed rule change as one establishing or changing a member due fee or other charge imposed by the exchange under section baii of the act  and rule bf thereunder which renders the proposed rule change effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to i establish a digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed and ii make a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one feed enterprise fee the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to i establish a digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed and ii make a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one feed enterprise fee the commission recently approved a proposed rule change by the exchange to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed  as well as published proposed rule changes to establish related fees the bats one feed is a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on edgx and its affiliated exchanges  and for which the bats exchanges report quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed also contains the individual last sale information for the bats exchanges collectively with the aggregate bbo the “bats one summary feed” in addition the bats one feed contains optional functionality which enables recipients to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the bats exchanges for up to five  price levels “bats one premium feed” bats one digital media enterprise fee the exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to establish a digital media enterprise fee of  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed as an alternative to user fees a recipient firm may purchase a monthly digital media enterprise license to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor  to distribute to an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users  for viewing via television web sites and mobile devices for informational and nontrading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of users to the exchange the digital media enterprise fee would be in addition to the data consolidation fee start printed page  nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the exchange proposes a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the fee schedule currently states that “as an alternative to user fees a recipient firm may purchase a monthly enterprise fee to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users” the exchange proposes to amend this sentence in two ways the first amendment is to state that a recipient firm may purchase a monthly enterprise license rather than enterprise fee as the term “license” is a more accurate description the second is to specify that the recipient firm purchasing a monthly enterprise license does so to distribute the bats one feed to an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users  statutory basis bats one digital media enterprise fee the exchange believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed is consistent with section b of the act in general and section b of the act in particular in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data products to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data in addition the proposed fee is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply uniformly to market data vendors television broadcasters web site and mobile service providers the exchange believes it is reasonable to establish a lower cost fee structure that is designed to facilitate broader media distribution of the bats one data feed for informational purposes because it will benefit investors generally in establishing the digital media enterprise fee the exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easiertoadminister data distribution mode that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today the exchange believes the digital media enterprise fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between professional and nonprofessional users account for the extent of access to the data or report the number of users this is a significant reduction on a recipient firms administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors for example a television broadcaster could display the bats one feed data during marketrelated programming and on its web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data all without having to account for andor measure who accesses the data and how often they do so the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from the bats one feed to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today for example a recipient firm may purchase an enterprise license in the amount of  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users which is greater than the digital media enterprise fee proposed herein the exchange also believes the amount of the digital enterprise sic is reasonable as compared to the existing enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of bats one feed data is limited to television web sites and mobile devices for informational purposes only while distribution of the bats one feed data pursuant to an enterprise license contains no such limitation the exchange also believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges the exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with edga byx and bzx in proposing the digital media enterprise fee to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchange from a cost perspective while the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the bats one feed they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the bats one feed as discussed in in sic the bats one fee proposal any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products and if they so choose perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the exchange performs in creating the bats one feed and offer a data feed with the same information included in the bats one feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the exchange to enable such competition the exchange is offering the digital media enterprise license for the bats one feed on terms that a subscriber of the underlying feeds could offer a competing product if it so chooses the bats one feed is comprised of data included in edgx depth edga depth byx depth and bzx depth currently an external distributor could create a competing product to the bats one premium feed  by purchasing each of these depth of book products start printed page from the individual bats exchanges and then performing its own aggregation and consolidation functions the combined external distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the bats exchanges is  per month an external distributor that seeks to create a competing product to the bats one summary feed could instead subscribe to the following data feeds edgx top edgx last sale edga top edga last sale bzx top bzx last sale byx top and byx last sale and then perform their own aggregation and consolidation function the combined external distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the bats exchanges is  per month the exchange proposes to charge a digital media enterprise fee  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed plus the  per month data consolidation fee that exceeds the combined external distributor fees for each of the individual feeds listed above to ensure that vendors could compete with the exchange by creating the same product as the bats one feed to sell to their clients at no greater cost than the exchange the decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in netcoalition v sec  fd  dc cir  upheld the commissions reliance upon the existence of competitive market mechanisms to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data in fact the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed and that the sec wield its regulatory power in those situations where competition may not be sufficient such as in the creation of a consolidated transactional reporting system id at  quoting hr rep no  at   as reprinted in  usccan  the court agreed with the commissions conclusion that “congress intended that competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the us national market system for trading equity securities ”  as explained below in the exchanges statement on burden on competition the exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards in addition the existence of alternatives to the bats one feed including realtime consolidated data free delayed consolidated data and proprietary last sale data from other sources as described below further ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and users can elect such alternatives as the netcoalition decision noted the commission is not required to undertake a costofservice or ratemaking approach and the exchange incorporates by reference into this proposed rule change its affiliates analysis of this topic in another rule filing for these reasons the exchange believes that the proposed fees are reasonable equitable and not unfairly discriminatory nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the exchange believes that the proposed change to the bats one enterprise fee is consistent with section b of the act in general and section b of the act in particular in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the proposal to amend the description of the enterprise fee within the fee schedule is equitable and reasonable because the changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion the proposed changes do not amend the amount or application of the bats one enterprise fee the proposed changes are also nondiscriminatory as they would apply to all recipient firms uniformly b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act as amended bats one digital media enterprise fee the bats one feed digital media enterprise fee will enhance competition because it provides investors with an alternative option for receiving market data and competes directly with similar market data products currently offered by the nyse and nasdaq the exchange notes that there is already actual competition for products similar to the bats one feed the nyse offers bqt which provides bbo and last sale information for the nyse nyse arca equities inc and nyse mkt llc nasdaq offers nasdaq basic a filed market data product and through its affiliate offers nls plus which provides a unified view of last sale information similar to the bats one feed the existence of these competing data products demonstrates that there is ample existing competition for products such as the bats one feed and the fees associated by such products is constrained by competition in establishing the proposed fees the exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition the exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors in order to establish start printed page fair reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all users the existence of alternatives to the bats one feed including the existing underlying feeds consolidated data and proprietary data from other sources ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase finally although the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements would be taken to create the bats one feed the exchange is not the exclusive distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that would compose the bats one feed the exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with edga byx and bzx in its design of the bats one feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchange from a cost perspective while the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the bats one feed they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the bats one feed as discussed in in the bats one fee proposal any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products and if they so choose perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the exchange performs in creating the bats one feed and offer a data feed with the same information included in the bats one feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the exchange to enable such competition the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the bats exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the exchange the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license coupled with the data consolidation fee is not lower than the cost to a vendor of receiving the underlying data feeds to create a competing product therefore the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license the exchange would charge clients for the bats one feed compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the bats exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the exchange nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the proposal to amend the description of the enterprise fee within the fee schedule will not have any impact on completion sic the proposed changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion and do not amend the amount or application of the bats one enterprise fee c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action the foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section ba of the act  and paragraph f of rule b thereunder at any time within  days of the filing of the proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act iv solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to

documentthis document has been published in the federal register use the pdf linked in the document sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble august   pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on august   edgx exchange inc the “exchange” or “edgx” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has designated this proposal as a “noncontroversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section ba of the act  and rule bfiii thereunder which renders it effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend rule  to describe a market data product known as edgx book viewer the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to add language to rule  describing a market data product known as edgx book viewer the proposal memorializes in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge edgx book viewer is a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregated twoside quotations for up to five  price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchange and for which the exchanges reports quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan edgx book viewer also contains the last ten  trades including time of trade price and share quantity book viewer is currently available via wwwbatstradingcom without charge the exchange will file a separate proposed rule change with the commission proposing fees to be charged for certain types of access to edgx book viewer as of september    statutory basis the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with start printed page section b of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and to protect investors and the public interest and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers this proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of edgx book viewer the exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section b of the act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchangeonly data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed the proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to realtime depthofbook information contained in edgx book viewer the proposed rule change also removes impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by memorializing in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory edgx book viewer is accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis in that neither the exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available accordingly distributors and subscribers can discontinue use at any time and for any reason in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history in addition edgx book viewer removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because edgx book viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the new york stock exchange inc “nyse” and the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” the provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms edgx book viewer is precisely the sort of market data product that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the proposal is not intended to address any competitive issues but rather to memorialize in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge nonetheless the exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by the exchange offering a service similar to that offered by the nyse and nasdaq thus the exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges therefore the exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action the exchange has designated this rule filing as noncontroversial under section ba of the act  and paragraph f of rule b thereunder the proposed rule change effects a change that a does not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest b does not impose any significant burden on competition and c by its terms does not become operative for  days after the date of the filing or such shorter time as the start printed page commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest provided that the selfregulatory organization has given the commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change or such shorter time as designated by the commission at any time within  days of the filing of the proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is i necessary or appropriate in the public interest ii for the protection of investors or iii otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved iv
