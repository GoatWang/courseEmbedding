art comes natuzzi open art the endeavour has evolved out of the extraordinary passion of pasquale natuzzi for beauty in one of its most noble forms art the idea for natuzzi open art took seed in  through collaboration with arnaldo pomodoro for the salone del mobile furniture fair in milan the project became official in april  the goal being to bring art into natuzzi stores and make it accessible or ‘open’ to everyone natuzzi open art envisages the collaboration with contemporary artists of all backgrounds to create sitespecific works of art brought to life inside natuzzis flagship stores around the world the first collaboration was with sculptor giacomo benevelli followed by partnerships with nicola de verme and gianni basso the latest project in december  saw french artist adrien missika create an art installation at the natuzzi store in miami more details  asta cielare by arnaldo pomodoro from the prestigious collezione pasquale natuzzi “asta cielare” by arnaldo pomodoro master italian sculptor and goldsmith the sculpture set into the ground is an imposing  metre work in bronze created in a cascade of colours playing with light and shadow in harmony with the tones and clean lines of the collezione pasquale natuzzi immanent within the space the sculpture by arnaldo pomodoro also stands in stark relief against its surroundings  mater natura by giacomo benevelli a collection of accessories sculptures in marble and bronze on the theme of materiality and nature by giacomo benevelli—one of the greatest exponents of contemporary abstract sculpture—born of his desire to enrich the potential of the accessory beyond mere functionality and good design conferring upon it artistic value many of the works have been integrated into the natuzzi collection  secretely by nicola del verme the range of accessories designed by eclectic stylist and visionary nicola del verme was conceived as the perfect synthesis between two seemingly disparate worlds like those of interior design and fashion pieces of rigorous design that span artistically neighboring worlds such as sculpture and photography in secretly lies the force and value of a recollection one dear and intimate one that evokes the sweet scent of a memory or the dark anxiety of a secret  formae aquae by gianni basso a selection of stunning photographs by gianni basso international design and lifestyle photographer on the theme of water with technical determination and poetic intuition the artist has captured the characteristics of water in opposites through color shape and graphic gesture a neverending quest for the exquisite it is this constant tension with beauty that has united the worlds of natuzzi and basso who together have explored new artistic perspectives  the shape of energy by fabrizio plessi a work of explosive impact created by fabrizio plessi in celebration of the dynamism change and energy that has always driven pasquale natuzzi and his company the primordial hypnotic beauty of lava—the principle element of the artist’s work—appears to flow between the artwork and pieces of furniture  adrien missika on the occasion of the grand opening of the natuzzi flagship store in miami on wednesday  december  a sitespecific installation by adrien missika paris  will be presented adrien missika – french born artist living between berlin and mexico city – has been invited by curator myriam ben salah in recognition of his ability to translate his personal experience of an environment into art that can involve various media from sculpture to photography from installations to videos the project will allow missika to come into direct contact with apulia  historically a land of contamination – and with the company in all those aspects related to the design
