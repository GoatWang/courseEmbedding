the success of business earned from individual business and leisure travellers based on our sustainability commitments and activities we believe that guests choose our hilton family of hotels primarily based on their strong reputation for providing excellent products and services hospitality is our business sustainability is a lens a discipline we use to support our overall business of hospitality having said that we are reviewing our purchasing design and construction practices as well as brand standards to maximise efficiencies in all areas while maintaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction the company’s we care programme throughout europe which is being rolled into the more recent global commitments outlined herein reported last april that reduction in energy and water consumption resulted in saving more than usm since the programme started in —proving that sustainability is good business moving forward our mission is to manage our business through a lens of

facilities for our colleagues and better serve our communities by managing our business in this fashion and supporting our overall strategic objectives we feel we will create tangible business value for all of our stakeholders im most proud of our team members across the globe and the passion and enthusiasm they show every day for not only providing the best guest experience possible but finding ways to accomplish this with a likeminded focus on minimising our impact on the environment our team members are the real innovators and it is their efforts that i am most proud of beyond that in our european region energy and water consumption have already been reduced by  in the past two years in the uk and ireland the introduction of carbonfree electricity has reduced co emissions in participating hilton hotels by more than  tons or  of our carbon footprint in the united states hilton was the first in the industry to complete the installation of a commercial fuel cell power system atop the hilton new york delivering one of the cleanest powergenerating technologies available today i think the biggest lesson so far is that we still have much to learn to meet the growing demand of increased travel around the world we must be able to do so in a genuine sustainable fashion while still delivering unsurpassed levels of hospitality including a better night’s sleep an enhanced dining experience and a more productive meeting we must operate our business in ways that provide for our current needs while allowing future generations to meet their own needs this is the essence of sustainability and the path we must follow not only is it the right thing to do as responsible global citizens its the right thing to do for our business we have come a long way as a company and have learned so much to date but i am personally excited about the opportunities and challenges in front of us as we continue our journey education will play a vital role for hilton hotels corporation in the short and longterm on multiple levels as it relates to sustainability hilton hotels corporation is supporting its portfolio of commitments in a number of ways by building educational and engagement programmes for all brands and team members including online learning centralised web content and various training modules measuring and reporting on our progress the internal environmental management tool used within companymanaged hotels will be extended to all properties allowing us to track and report on our commitments and design processes and programmes that identify areas of opportunity to drive innovation and efficiencies revising brand operational and design and construction standards for  to ensure both internal and external best practices are shared adopted and transparent around the globe evaluating all current and future purchasing policies and practices across the brands to ensure that the range of products placed in hotels not only enhances the guest experience but drives value for owners while supporting the company’s overall sustainability efforts the sum of these parts will hopefully begin to lay a foundation of knowledge around sustainability

the uk as well as our global hr learning and development team the evolution will include a portfolio of content to engage our team members and guests share best practices and supply tips resources and

our impacts while looking at our business through a new lens that will enhance the guest experience and drive business value right now there are several macro economic issues that are driving sustainability irrespective of where you stand on climate change it remains fact that population growth globalisation and industrialisation are all accelerating the depletion of natural resources

lifestyles our communities as we know them and ultimately the sustainability of our planet in addition to these large macro issues were seeing a growing awareness from our guests business partners

page continue reading the main story this interview with christopher j nassetta president and chief executive of hilton worldwide was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q tell me about some of the leadership challenges you tackled at hiltona over the last several years we have focused on transforming the culture and the priorities of the company we have over  people and what i discovered when i joined the company five years ago is that we had a lot of segments of the company that operated very independently and we had massive amounts of duplication and fragmentation we needed alignment we needed people to understand who we were what we stood for and the key priorities of the company and we needed them once they understood that to get their oars in the water and head in a common direction i have spent most of my time in the last five years around building that culture and getting that alignmentq give me more of a sense of the problems you discovereda i would ask people what are the three or four key strategic priorities but as many people as i asked i got a different answer we always had good values but i just don’t think people understood what they really were in those first months when i traveled around the world i stopped counting when i got to  different value statements at our offices so we tried to simplify everything advertisement continue reading the main story i think of culture as guardrails the culture of a company is what you stand for essentially the ground rules so that people know how to operate you give them a direction and boundaries the trick is having an intense alignment around vision mission values and the key strategic priorities my job as ceo simply stated is to create the right culture set the tone the highlevel strategy continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q what sort of exercise did you go through to figure out the valuesa we did a lot of work with teams around the world and asked people to look at all their values statements and boil them down then we took all those ideas with us on a twoday offsite with about  of us there was a lot of overlap and we tried to consolidate it what i ended up saying to them was let’s use some of our own skills and brand it not because i want to be cute about it but because people will remember it i started looking around the room and at the letters and they came together as hilton — h for hospitality i for integrity l for leadership t for teamwork o for ownership and n for now to reinforce them we are constantly referring to the letters — in newsletters in town halls — almost to the point where we are driving people crazy but it works photo christopher j nassetta president and ceo of hilton worldwide says he has spent much of his time seeking to align the companys vision boundaries and priorities credit librado romerothe new york times q i’ve heard a lot of leaders talk about the importance of repetitiona you have to be careful as a leader particularly of a big organization you can find yourself communicating the same thing so many times that you get tired of hearing it and so you might alter how you say it or shorthand it because you have literally said it so many times that you think nobody else on earth could want to hear this but you can’t stop in my case there are  people who need to hear it and i can’t say it enough so what might sound mundane and like old news to me isn’t for a lot of other people that is an important lesson i learned as i worked in bigger organizationsq what are some of your other approaches to leadershipa one simple philosophy i have as a leader of a big organization is to have really steady hands on the wheel in a tumultuous world with so many things going on around you you have to know who you are what you stand for and where you are going and keep everyone pointed in the same direction and have the discipline to stick with it newsletter sign up continue reading the

first and foremost with people is what makes them tick and what motivates them and are they good communicators even the smartest people in the world if they can’t communicate in what is a very big matrix organization like ours that requires collaboration they are not going to be able to persuade and motivate people and that is going to be a problem another thing i am always looking for is humility i’m not looking for big egosq and how do you get a sense of thata you ask them about all they have done then listen for whether it’s all about me me me or about teams they’ve worked on i’ll say tell me some of the more interesting projects you have been involved with and how did they go tell me about some of the more difficult things you have done and how did you resolve themq and if you could ask somebody only a few questions in an interviewa i would probably just ask them straightup questions because i am pretty good at reading people i would probably say how do you think about operating in a matrix organization and would people around you — those you’ve worked with sidebyside above and below — think you have a big ego how would people judge your egoq don’t people know the right answer and simply say “no i don’t have a big ego”a it depends on how they say it they might give that answer but do they “um” and “er” and do their eyes wander if you watch body language you can tell a lot you would be amazed at some of the answers you get some people just admit it i have had more than one in  people say “yeah i’m strongwilled and sometimes my peers will think i am arrogant or have a little too much ego”q is that a dealbreaker for youa generally yesq but at least they’re somewhat selfawarea i love the selfaware part but unfortunately it’s hard to make it work in an organization like ours where big egos get in the way i’m not saying that occasionally we don’t have some egos and you have to manage them but you certainly can’t have a lot of them and still accomplish your goals continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think corner office conversations with adam bryant about leadership and management

different value statements at our offices so we tried to simplify everything advertisement continue reading the main story i think of culture as guardrails the culture of a company is what you stand for essentially the ground rules so that people know how to operate you give them a direction and boundaries the trick is having an intense alignment around vision mission values and the key strategic priorities my job as ceo simply stated is to create the right culture set the tone the highlevel strategy continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q what sort of exercise did you go through to figure out the valuesa we did a lot of work with teams around the world and asked people to look at all their values statements and boil them down then we took all those ideas with us on a twoday offsite with about  of us there was a lot of overlap and we tried to consolidate it what i ended up saying to them was let’s use some of our own skills and brand it not because i want to be cute about it but because people will remember it i started looking around the room and at the letters and they came together as hilton — h for hospitality i for integrity l for leadership t for teamwork o for ownership and n for now to reinforce them we are constantly referring to the letters — in newsletters in town halls — almost to the point where we are driving people crazy but it works photo christopher j nassetta president and ceo of hilton worldwide says he has spent much of his time seeking to align the companys vision boundaries and priorities credit librado romerothe new york times q i’ve heard a lot of leaders talk about the importance of repetitiona you have to be careful as a leader particularly of a big organization you can find yourself communicating the same thing so many times that you get tired of hearing it and so you might alter how you say it or shorthand it because you have literally said it so many times that you think nobody else on earth could want to hear this but you can’t stop in my case there are  people who need to hear it and i can’t say it enough so what might sound mundane and like old news to me isn’t for a lot of other people that is an important lesson i learned as i worked in bigger organizationsq what are some of your other approaches to leadershipa one simple philosophy i have as a leader of a big organization is to have really steady hands on the wheel in a tumultuous world with so many things going on around you you have to know who you are what you stand for and where you are going and keep everyone pointed in the same direction and have the discipline to stick with it newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email

or contact us anytime q let’s shift to hiring what questions do you aska the one thing i am always trying to figure out first and foremost with people is what makes them tick and what motivates them and are they good communicators even the smartest people in the world if they can’t communicate in what is a very big matrix organization like ours that requires collaboration they are not going to be able to persuade and motivate people and that is going to be a problem another thing i am always looking for is humility i’m not looking for big egosq and how do you get a sense of thata you ask them about all they have done then listen for whether it’s all about me me me or about teams they’ve worked on i’ll say tell me some of the more interesting projects you have been involved with and how did they go tell me about some of the more difficult things you have done and how did you resolve themq and if you could ask somebody only a few questions in an interviewa i would probably just ask them straightup questions because i am pretty good at reading people i would probably say how do you think about operating in a matrix organization and would people around you — those you’ve worked with sidebyside above and below — think you have a big ego how would people judge your egoq don’t people know the right answer and simply say “no i don’t have a big ego”a it depends on how they say it they might give that answer but do they “um” and “er” and do their eyes wander if you watch body language you can tell a lot you would be amazed at some of the answers you get some people just admit it i have had more than one in  people say “yeah i’m strongwilled and sometimes my peers will think i am arrogant or have a little too much ego”q is that a dealbreaker for youa generally yesq but at least they’re somewhat selfawarea i love the selfaware part but unfortunately it’s hard to make it work in an organization like ours where big egos get in the way i’m not saying that occasionally we don’t have some egos and you have to manage them but you certainly can’t have a lot of them and still accomplish your goals continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page
