should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of mackcali realty corporation and mackcali realty lp and the notes thereto collectively the financial statements certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the financial statements executive overview mackcali realty corporation together with its subsidiaries collectively the general partner is one of the largest real estate investment trusts reits in the united states mackcali realty lp the operating partnership has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development management and ownership for over  years and the general partner has been a publicly traded reit since  the operating partnership conducts the business of providing leasing management acquisition development construction and tenantrelated services for its general partner the operating partnership through its operating divisions and subsidiaries including the mackcali propertyowning partnerships and limited liability companies is the entity through which all of the general partners operations are conducted unless stated otherwise or the context requires the company refers to the general partner and its subsidiaries including the operating partnership and its subsidiaries the company owns or has interests in  properties collectively the properties consisting of  office and  flex properties primarily class a office and officeflex buildings totaling approximately  million square feet leased to approximately  commercial tenants and  multifamily rental properties containing  residential units the properties are located primarily in the northeast some with adjacent companycontrolled developable land sites able to accommodate up to  million square feet of additional commercial space and approximately  apartment units the companys historical strategy has been to focus its operations acquisition and development of office properties in highbarriertoentry markets and submarkets where it believes it is or can become a significant and preferred owner and operator in september  the company announced a threeyear strategic initiative to transform into a more concentrated owner of new jersey hudson river waterfront and transitoriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multifamily residential properties as part of this plan over the past year the company has sold or has contracted to sell multiple properties primarily commercial office which it believes do not meet its longterm goals as an owner of real estate almost all of the companys earnings and cash flow are derived from rental revenue received pursuant to leased space at the properties key factors that affect the companys business and financial results include the following  the general economic climate  the occupancy rates of the properties  rental rates on new or renewed leases  tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain and retain tenants  the extent of early lease terminations  the value of our office properties and the cash flow from the sale of such properties  operating expenses  anticipated acquisition and development costs for office and multifamily rental properties and the revenues and earnings from these properties  cost of capital and  the extent of acquisitions development and sales of real estate including the execution of the companys current strategic initiative any negative effects of the above key factors could potentially cause a deterioration in the companys revenue andor earnings such negative effects could include  failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire  failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of inplace leases and  tenant defaults a failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of inplace leases may be affected by several factors such as  the local economic climate which may be adversely impacted by business table of contents layoffs or downsizing industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors and  local real estate conditions such as oversupply of the companys product types or competition within the market of the companys core office markets most have recently shown signs of improvement while others have stabilized the percentage leased in the companys consolidated portfolio of stabilized core operating commercial properties aggregating  million  million and  million square feet at december    and  respectively was  percent leased at december   as compared to  percent leased at december   and  percent leased at december   after adjusting for properties identified as noncore at the time percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date leases that expired as of december    and  aggregate   and  square feet respectively or   and  percentage of the net rentable square footage respectively rental rates including escalations on the companys commercial space that was renewed based on first rents payable during the year ended december   on  square feet of renewals increased an average of  percent compared to rates that were in effect under the prior leases as compared to a  percent increase during  on  square feet of renewals and a  percent decrease in  on  square feet of renewals estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in  averaged  per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of  years estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in  averaged  per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of  years and estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in  averaged  per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of  years the company has achieved positive leasing results in its core markets recently it believes that commercial vacancy rates may decrease and commercial rental rates may increase in some of its markets in  and possibly beyond as of december   commercial leases which comprise approximately  and  percent of the companys annualized base rent are scheduled to expire during the years ended december   and  respectively with the positive leasing results the company has achieved in many of its markets recently the company believes that rental rates on new leases will generally be on average not lower than rates currently being paid although the company has recently achieved positive leasing activity primarily in its core markets if the recent leasing results do not prove to be sustaining during  and beyond the companys rental rates it may achieve on new leases may be lower than the rates currently being paid resulting in the potential for less revenue from the same space the company believes that there is a potential for moodys or standard  poors to lower their current investment grade ratings on the companys senior unsecured debt to subinvestment grade amongst other things any such downgrade by both moodys and standard  poors will increase the current interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the companys current  million unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in january  from libor plus  basis points to libor plus  basis points and the annual credit facility fee it pays will increase from  to  basis points additionally any such downgrade would increase the current interest rate on each of the companys  million unsecured term loan and  million unsecured term loan from libor plus  basis points to libor plus  points in the event of a downgrade the company could elect to utilize the leverage grid pricing available under the unsecured revolving credit facility and both unsecured term loans this would result in an interest rate of libor plus  basis points for the companys unsecured revolving credit facility and  basis points for the facility fee and libor plus  basis points for both unsecured term loans at the companys current total leverage ratio in addition a downgrade in its ratings to subinvestment grade would result in higher interest rates on senior unsecured debt that the company may issue in the future as compared to issuing such debt with investment grade ratings the remaining portion of this managements discussion and analysis of financial
