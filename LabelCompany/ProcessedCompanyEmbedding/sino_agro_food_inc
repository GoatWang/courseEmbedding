siaf  ose siafme a specialized investment company focused on protein food including seafood and cattle announces recognition of its apras aquaculture technology and products of its former subsidiary triway industries tw in which sino agro food inc holds a  ownership interest earlier the company announced two very significant milestones in the ongoing development and buildout of tw namely a a rating from dun  bradstreet july   press release and signing a bank enterprise comprehensive cooperation agreement containing a credit facility of rmb  million with agricultural bank of china july   press release the press releases are found on our website httpsinoagrofoodinvestorroomcomtriwaya and httpsinoagrofoodinvestorroomcomtwabcbecsca now triway is proud to announce that its operations are gaining media recognition throughout the guangdong province a province whose gross domestic product exceeds usd  trillion the largest provincial gdp in mainland china aquafarm  prominently featured in two television broadcasts a zhongshan station recently aired the first in a series of news segments at tws aquaculture farm  highlighting it as one of a select few facilities that meet the highest government standards for food safety and sanitation in the production of live seafood the apras technology produces chemicalfree seafood allowing for premium pricing of this coveted product line both domestically and internationally guangdongs nanfang a regional chinese broadcast station covering an area of approximately  million people aired a full edutainment program highlighting the apras technology and including an interview with siafs chief scientific officer dr anthony ostrowski the show features several celebrity chefs examining the indoor tanks and later sampling silver cod jade perch mandarin fish tilapia sleepy cod and salt water prawns these broadcasts as well as supporting material will be available shortly in the triway section of sino agro foods web site httpwwwsinoagrofoodcomcontentaf ceo and cso commentary mr solomon lee interim chairman of tw as well as chairman and ceo of sino agro food inc expressed his sincere appreciation for the recent media coverage adding our mission remains threefold to produce great product to market great product and to distribute great product tv stations such as zstv and nanfang tv allow us to reach their extensive viewing areas helping to broaden brand awareness and publicize the benefits of indoor farmed seafood we believe ongoing press coverage will further several aims facilitate sellthrough to consumers directly through ecommerce and from our wholesale customers consolidate and extend premium pricing and potentially broaden the footprint of capital awards apras technology within china and possibly into other asian countries siaf chief scientific officer dr anthony ostrowski offered additional perspective the ocean supply of seafood has remained stagnant since the mids while the demand worldwide and especially in china is increasing rapidly in addition as more and more chinese enter the middle class specific demand for safe and sustainably produced seafood is rising quickly aquafarm  is a largescale model for technologically advanced indoor and environmentally friendly aquaculture production of safe highquality and healthy seafood the farm already enjoys a competitive advantage for freshness owing to its valuable location adjacent to hong kong and macau bordering shenzhen and guangzhou to the north within  miles of tens of millions of people longer term plans call for the zhongshan facility to produce well over  metric tons of prawns and fish annually likewise triway is working toward an integrated set of facilities and processes to become vertically integrated with respect to life cycle — from its own selectivelybred broodstock and inhouse hatchery seed supplies through growout and sale — of genetically and environmentally controlled biosecure and ultimately internationally certified sustainable seafood contact peter grossman investor relations  infosinoagrofoodcom todd fromer  elizabeth barker    siafkcsacom nordic countries   infosesinoagrofoodcom this

contributing to a  decrease in gross profits to usd m m the value added component accounted for  of the gross profit decline all three components were affected to various degrees by unstable market conditions with the biggest factors being margin pressure on imported beef due to increased competition from more exports entering the china market these external factors are volatile with pricing and demand fluctuating quarter to quarter into these headwinds in q  sjap did manage a positive blended gross profit margin of   the company had initiated plans to increase overall profitability primarily upgrading its line of cattle directing toward the highend market and adding to its range of value added products including canned beef products these operational enhancements were part of the efforts to prepare sjap for maximum valuation while the company concurrently used the aquaculture coso strategy as a blueprint for sjap – including sourcing capital needs through third parties and targeting a listing on the neeq third board of the shanghai stock exchange some time in  now because of additional more sweeping plans resulting from an understanding with the xining government siaf intends to list sjap on the main board in either shanghai or shenzhen during q the xining government engaged sjap in discussions aimed to help the cattle and beef industry and promote economic development in the district which boasts annual production of over four million head of cattle sjap was selected as the lead company to coordinate and carry out regional plans over time while adhering to its original company specific plan the main features of this overarching coordinated plan include through a jointuse agreement with the district government concentrating and centralizing all slaughterhouse operations in the xining district to sjaps facility by funneling existing abattoir companies to one location creating a main cattle and meat center for wholesaling cold storage downstream distribution processing of valueadded products and other logistics trade and support activities sjap has been chosen to become one of the leading companies operating such a business the government intends to provide sjap with additional commercially and industrially zoned land adjacent to its existing site this will increase sjaps valuable land bank by  the government will also provide sjap additional land at a second location to move its existing operations apart from value added processing sjap will expand the cooperative farming model to mold local growers and farmers into a united team with the aim of helping all farmers out of poverty by the end of  the government has agreed to support sjap in an effort to procure a listing on the main stock exchange board either in shanghai or shenzhen sjap believes the governments support will facilitate a successful listing effort and that the main board offers many advantages likely including a higher valuation if listed the company shares will be designated as domestically listed foreign investment shares enabling foreign investors to trade shares globally siaf and sjap are honored by the governments recognition and excited by the prospects it bestows siaf has invited a main board listed company to join the sjap team to help promote these goals including procuring project financing project development  capital award ca capital award

also provide periodic updates of milestones and markers related to both production and strategic progress either as web updates or standalone press releases quarterly results will provide a breakdown of production volumes and prospects for each aquafarm operation as they materialize seafood and meat trading quarterly revenue increased by  yoy to usd m m the increase was primarily due to scaling the business toward capacity and sourcing seafood from multiple countries instead of solely from madagascar as in the past gross profit grew  to usd m m for the quarter ended march   generating a blended gross margin of  while accounting for  of total revenue both the revenue and gross profit for seafood each grew  yoy increased competition in beef imports caused the cost of goods rate to increase slightly more than the rate of revenue the import trading business continues to be a reliable and growing operation carveout exercises  the company firmly believes that the sum of its parts is worth considerably more than the markets value of the whole accordingly it has undertaken efforts to carve out its major businesses establishing each as a standalone corporate entity these carveout enterprises will seek to establish value within the same financial measures afforded peer group companies establishing stepwise increasing valuations in part through private placement prior to applying to higher valued market exchanges for ipo major milestones reached in the process will reflect progress imputed value and liquidity completing the aquaculture carveout was the first upcoming steps are as follows triway has begun work with its appointed hong kong based corporate service company hkcs to issue and allocate triway shares in bookkeeping form to respective owners including siafs  interest and the remaining  among approximately  original investorspartners as of april  hksc records reflected m shares of triway having been allocated to the company the issuance of which is anticipated to completed at the end of may upon completion hkcs will file corresponding documents to the hong kong company register noting paid up capital estimated at usd m and total outstanding shares of m at a par value of hkd  each this submission of corresponding documents will occur  days after share issuance concurrently siaf is working with us attorneys preparing required documentation for submission to the sec in preparation for the distribution of a dividend in the form of triway shares totaling  of triways equity shares broadridge solutions the companys transfer agent in the us will distribute the dividend in book entry form pending sec and finra approvals targeting completion by the end of july triway and its investment banker are preparing presentation with attendant legal and accounting materials to initiate a private placement program including road shows prir programs and readiness for due diligence processes by interested investors completion is targeted to commence midjuly at the same time apart from equity financing triway is working with several other reputable investment banks to secure alternative or complementary debt financing one bank completed its due diligence last month presenting the possibility of securing a loan facility in may others have started the process in may with respect to the facility offer of usd m granted by a local bank to jfd china this facility is purposed for working capital to be utilized after new facilities have been developed and their respective operational costs warrant a drawdown on the loc these steps and others to follow provide the blueprint for later coso candidates with sjap on deck share count  the total issued and outstanding share count tio as of december   was  as of may   tio share count is  the additional shares were utilized to secureunderwrite a loan on behalf of triway from a third party lender  the figure includes shares issued as collateral for credit loan facilities and other debt at any given time there are a variable number of such shares within the total issued and outstanding it important to note that subject to some customary provisions these shares must be returned to siaf upon debt repayment a commonality would be these shares likened to a lien on property in the sense that neither dilutes equity these shares do not carry voting rights nor are they eligible for dividend disbursements for example these shares would not be eligible for triway shares once a dividend is declared   the company is rather confident that triway will be successful in its fundraising program to selffinance its capex requirements as well sjap has been making progress toward selffunding as such both triway and sjap soon will no longer be as dependent on siaf to provide bridge financing thus the company should be positioned to repurchase both collateral shares from its lenders as well as from the market to help improve overall share value in the near future  ceo commentary  sino agro foods chairman and ceo solomon lee addressed the quarter and  corporate strategies we entered  with strong momentum having undertaken a series of initiatives in  to position our operations to continue growth trajectories while making significant progress on our strategic plan to restructure the business and maximize value for shareholders during the quarter we announced the successful completion of the carveout of our aquaculture operations into triway industries ltd a hong kong domiciled corporation an independent valuation determined that the certified fair value of the transacted assets to be usd m sino agro food the parent holds a  equity interest equating to usd m or usd  per share siaf share based on the weighted average number of fully diluted outstanding shares in the quarter the company has long believed that its embedded businesses are undervalued in the current structure and as traded on the current exchanges the carveout was a major step in our carveoutspinoff coso strategy designed to accomplish several significant related objectives foremost the coso strategy aims to demonstrate increasing valuations backed by third party assessment third party investment and new exchange trading where the assets are expected to be valued commensurate with pure play peers the carveout valuation already resulted in a deemed gain on sale of m further stepped up valuations are targeted through preipo investments and ultimately an ipo the new organization for the aquaculture business will support accelerated growth due to its streamlined business structure furthermore it is now better suited for infusions of working and development capital the transferred assets have recently undergone renovations and modernizations to improve their interoperability and to prime them to increase production growth rate targets retain a substantial interest in the selfsufficient spun off companies which are expected to generate sufficient cash to selffund capital expenditures after the initial debt andor equity financings while also distributing dividend shares to siaf shareholders after maturing businesses and demonstrating scalability and coso steps are realized siaf the parent is expected to become a more streamlined and flexible company as development capital expenditures become the responsibility of the children companies siaf expects to increase free cash flow with the intent to distribute it in the form of cash dividends andor a share buyback program our primary objectives for  are to increase returns from our aquaculture investment at a larger scale likewise for other business segments as the right opportunities surface we are now in a strong position to capitalize on the new capacity developed in  and  and look forward to moving toward actualizing properly appreciated ipo valuations although the coso strategy is an inherently long and complex process we are proud of our accomplishments to date in the aquaculture business and are encouraged by the current timeline for progress as outlined in the carveout section above discussions with our advisors and investment banker support this milestone path likewise they reinforce our firm belief that the sum of our business parts is worth considerably more than the markets value of the whole i am very confident that the strategy will succeed in unlocking substantial value for our shareholders as steps along the way are designed to evidence buoyed by encouragement to date your management team remains committed to fulfilling the coso strategy starting with the aquaculture business at the same time the team is further encouraged to manage and grow all businesses efficiently the beef business sjap is facing unstable markets as noted earlier in this release in a very real sense these challenges have presented an opportunity to collaborate with the provincial government to develop a plan that from our perspective will better position sjap as a major player in the china beef market culminating with a listing on the main board in china either in shanghai or shenzhen this was a strong start to the year and we will continue to execute against our strategic plan to reach the milestones outlined above during this pivotal time in the companys evolution q  interim report  for detailed segment operational performance and developments
