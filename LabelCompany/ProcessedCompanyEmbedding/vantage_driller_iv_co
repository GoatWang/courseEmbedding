participating in the exchange offer additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations or the value of the exchange notes we cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur if they do our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our securities including the exchange notes could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment risk related to the exchange offer if you do not properly tender your old notes you will continue to hold unregistered old notes and your ability to transfer those notes will be adversely affected we will only issue exchange notes in exchange for old notes that you timely and properly tender therefore you should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the old notes and you should carefully follow the instructions on how to tender your old notes neither we nor the exchange agent is required to inform you of any defects or irregularities with respect to your tender of old notes please read the exchange offerprocedures for tendering and description of the exchange notes if you do not exchange your old notes for exchange notes in the exchange offer you will continue to be subject to the restrictions on transfer of your old notes described in the legend on the certificates for your old notes in general you may only offer or sell the old notes if they are registered under the securities act and applicable state securities laws or offered and sold under an exemption from these requirements we do not plan to register any sale of the old notes under the securities act for further information regarding the consequences of tendering your old notes in the exchange offer please read the exchange offerconsequences of failure to exchange outstanding securities you may find it difficult to sell your exchange notes although the exchange notes will be registered under the securities act the exchange notes will not be listed on any securities exchange because there is no public market for the exchange notes you may not be able to resell them we cannot assure you that an active market will exist for the exchange notes or that any trading market that does develop will be liquid if an active market does not develop or is not maintained the market price and liquidity of the exchange notes may be adversely affected if a market for the exchange notes develops they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price the trading market for the exchange notes may be adversely affected by        changes in the overall market for noninvestment grade securities        changes in our financial performance or prospects        the financial performance or prospects for companies in our industry generally        the number of holders of the exchange notes        the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the exchange notes and        prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions    table of contents historically the market for noninvestment grade debt has been subject to substantial volatility in prices the market for the exchange notes if any may be subject to similar volatility prospective investors in the exchange notes should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of such investment for an indefinite period of time some holders who exchange their old notes may be deemed to be underwriters if you exchange your old notes in the exchange offer for the purpose of participating in a distribution of the exchange notes you may be deemed to have received restricted securities and if so will be required to comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act in connection with any resale transaction risks related to our business and our industry our business is difficult to evaluate due to our limited operating history and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges because we have a limited operating history you may not be able to evaluate our future prospects accurately our prospects will be primarily dependent on our ability to maintain customer drilling contracts for our drilling units and other factors listed below if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges our prospects business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected a small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of one or more of these customers or our inability to ultimately realize future contracted revenue could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers during the fiscal year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our revenue upon the commencement of the petrobras contract for the titanium explorer  we expect that petrobras will become a major customer and together with ongc will account for an estimated contract backlog of approximately  billion as of september   our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any one of these customers interrupt or curtail their activities fail to pay for the services that have been performed terminate their contracts fail to renew their existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts and we are unable to enter into contracts with new customers on comparable terms the loss of any of our significant customers or our inability to ultimately realize future contracted revenue could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we are exposed to the credit risks of our key customers including certain affiliated companies and certain other third parties and nonpayment or nonperformance by these customers and other parties could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers including certain companies owned by or associated with our affiliates under the construction supervision contract for the cobalt explorer  a drillship for which construction was suspended in june  f capital owes us approximately  million for services rendered in  before the suspension of this contract any material nonpayment or nonperformance by these entities for any services we may provide in the future other key customers and certain other third parties could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows if any key customers or other parties default on their obligations to us our financial results and condition could be adversely affected furthermore some of these customers and other parties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks    table of contents a material or extended decline in expenditures by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies due to a decline or volatility in oil and natural gas prices a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas or other factors would adversely affect our business our business including the utilization rates and dayrates we achieve for our owned and managed drilling units depends on the level of activity in oil and natural gas exploration development and production expenditures of our customers oil and natural gas prices and customers expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity commodity prices are affected by numerous factors including the following        changes in global economic conditions        worldwide production and demand for oil and natural gas and any geographical dislocations in supply and demand        the cost of exploring for producing and delivering oil and natural gas        expectations regarding future prices        advances in exploration development and production technology        the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing        the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas        the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves        the level of production in nonopec countries        domestic and international tax policies        the development and exploitation of alternative fuels        weather        blowouts and other catastrophic events        governmental laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations        the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves        volatility in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies and        the worldwide military and political environment uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in significant oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere in addition to oil and gas prices the offshore drilling industry is influenced by additional factors including        the availability of competing offshore drilling vessels and the level of construction activity for new drilling vessels        the level of costs for associated offshore oilfield and construction services        oil and gas transportation costs        the discovery of new oil and gas reserves        the cost of nonconventional hydrocarbons and        regulatory restrictions on offshore drilling    table of contents any of these factors could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business and results of operations our jackup drilling contracts are generally shortterm and we could experience reduced profitability if customers reduce activity levels terminate or seek to renegotiate drilling contracts with us or if market conditions dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage or turnkey basis rather than on a dayrate basis many jackup drilling contracts are shortterm and oil and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to downward changes in oil and natural gas prices due to the shortterm nature of most of our jackup drilling contracts a decline in market conditions can quickly affect our business if customers reduce their levels of operations during depressed market conditions a customer may no longer need a unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable unit at a lower dayrate as a result customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing drilling contracts or avoid their obligations under those contracts in addition our customers may have the right to terminate or may seek to renegotiate existing contracts if we experience downtime operational problems above the contractual limit or safetyrelated issues if the drilling unit is a total loss if the drilling unit is not delivered to the customer within the period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances which include events beyond the control of either party some of our current jackup drilling contracts and some drilling contracts that we may enter into in the future may include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without cause with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments in addition we could be required to pay penalties which could be material if some of these contracts are terminated due to downtime operational problems or failure to deliver some of the contracts with customers that we enter into in the future may be cancellable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract early termination of a contract may result in a drilling unit being idle for an extended period of time the likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness under most of our contracts it is an event of default if we file a petition for bankruptcy or reorganization which would allow the customer to terminate such contract currently our drilling contracts are dayrate contracts where we charge a fixed rate per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well while we plan to continue to perform services on a dayrate basis market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage basis where we are paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well or enter into turnkey contracts where we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and bear some of the well equipment costs these types of contracts are riskier for us than a dayrate contract as we would be subject to downhole geologic conditions in the well that cannot always be accurately determined and subject us to greater risks associated with equipment and downhole tool failures unfavorable downhole geologic conditions and equipment and downhole tool failures may result in significant cost increases or may result in a decision to abandon a well project which would result in us not being able to invoice revenues for providing services any such termination or renegotiation of contracts and unfavorable costs increases or loss of revenue could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations lower prices for oil and natural gas reduce demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability a slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession initially reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices benchmark crude prices peaked at over  per barrel in july  and then declined dramatically to approximately  per barrel at yearend  during  and  the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated between the mid s per barrel and low s per barrel since mid the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated between the mid s per barrel and low s per barrel demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly    table of contents affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices in addition demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the nearterm levels of exploration development and production activity perceptions of longerterm lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the longterm nature of many largescale development projects lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability additionally these factors may adversely impact our financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our longlived assets failure to obtain delivery of the tungsten explorer and to secure a new drilling contract for this vessel could have a material and adverse effect on our business we expect to take delivery of the tungsten explorer in the second quarter of  but such vessel may not be delivered to us on time or at all a delay in the delivery date of the tungsten explorer beyond what we expect or nondelivery of such vessel could result from a variety of factors affecting the shipyard or our failure to make the final construction payment under the tungsten explorer construction contract failure to obtain delivery of the tungsten explorer in a timely manner or at all may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if any nondelivery of the tungsten explorer results from nonperformance by the shipyard holders of the notes and any other pari passu obligations may not have the benefit of a refund guarantee if we are not able to obtain an assignment of any such refund guarantee and the tungsten explorer construction contract for the benefit of the holders of the notes and other pari passu obligations which we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as practicable there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain an assignment of any such refund guarantee or the tungsten explorer construction contract in addition we have not yet secured a drilling contract for the tungsten explorer  and there can be no guarantee that we will enter into a drilling contract for the vessel prior to its delivery our ability to obtain a contract will depend on prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control further upon obtaining a drilling contract for the tungsten explorer  such drilling contract may be cancelled or we may be required to pay damages to our customer if the vessel is not acceptable to the customer or if we are unable to deliver the tungsten explorer or an acceptable replacement drillship to our customer by the relevant contract commencement date deadline the cancellation of the contract or payment of damages to such customer may have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects construction projects are subject to risks including delays and cost overruns which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations the tungsten explorer is currently under construction and we are managing this project with the shipyard we are also overseeing the construction of the dalian developer for a third party as part of our growth strategy we may also contract from time to time for the construction of drilling units or may enter into agreements to manage the construction of drilling units for others construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project including costs or delays resulting from the following        unexpected long delivery times for or shortages of key equipment parts and materials        shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work        unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment labor and raw materials particularly steel        unforeseen design and engineering problems        unanticipated actual or purported change orders        work stoppages    table of contents      latent damages or deterioration to hull equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions        failure or delay of thirdparty service providers and labor disputes        disputes with shipyards and suppliers        delays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the completion of projects        financial or other difficulties at shipyards        adverse weather conditions and        inability to obtain required permits or approvals if we experience delays and costs overruns in the construction of the tungsten explorer or any other drilling units for which we may provide construction management services from time to time due to certain of the factors listed above it could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations delays in the delivery of the tungsten explorer may result in our inability to timely secure a drilling contract or result in the delay in contract commencement leading to financial penalties and a loss of expected revenue to us and may also cause the customer to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the unit pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses in the event this unit is not completed on a timely basis we may not be able to secure a replacement unit that is acceptable to the customer we may not be able to raise equity or debt financing sufficient to pay amounts due under future construction contracts or on acceptable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy our business is capital intensive and to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings to execute our growth strategy and to fund our capital expenditures if we are unable to borrow additional funds to the extent required or on acceptable terms raise other capital or utilize available cash on hand we may not be able to build or acquire future drilling units if for any reason we fail to make a payment when due which may result in a default under a construction contract or otherwise fail to take delivery of a new drilling unit we would be prevented from realizing potential revenues from these projects we could also lose all or a portion of payments already made and we could be liable for penalties and damages under such contracts our business is affected by local national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil and natural gas industry there has historically been a strong correlation between the development of the world economy and demand for energy including oil and gas although there are signs that the recent economic recession has abated in many countries there is still considerable instability in the world economy due in part to uncertainty in the united states regarding the federal debt ceiling and in the economies of eurozone countries such as greece spain portugal ireland and italy where a new economic downturn has introduced further volatility in the global markets in addition continued hostilities and insurrections in the middle east and north africa and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks against the united states or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the united states and of other countries these events and other local national and worldwide economic conditions could lead to a reduction in economic activity for the world economy which in turn could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas and for our services such changes could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows beyond what might be offset by the simultaneous impact of possibly higher oil and gas prices in addition future economic conditions or the expectation for future economic conditions may cause many oil and natural gas production companies to reduce or delay expenditures in order to reduce costs which in turn may cause a further reduction in the demand for drilling services    table of contents our industry is highly competitive cyclical and subject to intense price competition due to our limited operating history we may be at a competitive disadvantage the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive and contracts have traditionally been awarded on a competitive bid basis the technical capabilities availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job other key factors include a contractors reputation for service safety record environmental record technical and engineering support and longterm relationships with major national and independent oil and natural gas companies our competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger more diverse fleets longer operating histories with established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time and longterm relationships with customers this provides our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract our drilling units on favorable terms if at all and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations additionally we are at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that are better capitalized because they are in a better position to withstand the effects of a downturn in our industry the offshore contract drilling industry historically has been very cyclical with periods of high demand limited supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand excess supply and low dayrates many offshore drilling units are highly mobile competitors may move drilling units from region to region in response to changes in demand it is currently estimated that  newly constructed jackup rigs have or will be entered into service between march  and december  and  ultradeepwater rigs are scheduled for delivery through  this could result in an excess supply of rigs in the markets in which we operate periods of low demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time our limited operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and as a result our drilling units may become idle prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates or extended idle time could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates based upon information available to management at the time indicate that the carrying value of the drilling units may not be recoverable there may be limits to our ability to mobilize drilling units between geographic markets and the time and costs of such drilling unit mobilizations may be material to our business the offshore contract drilling market is generally a global market as drilling units may be mobilized from one market to another market however geographic markets can from time to time have material fluctuations in costs and risks as the ability to mobilize drilling units can be impacted by several factors including but not limited to governmental regulation and customs practices the significant costs to move a drilling unit availability of tow boats weather political instability civil unrest military actions and the technical capability of the drilling units to operate in various environments any increase in the supply of drilling units in the geographic areas in which we operate whether through new construction refurbishment or conversion of drilling units from other uses remobilization or changes in the law or its application could increase competition and result in lower dayrates andor utilization which would adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows additionally while a drilling unit is being mobilized from one geographic market to another we may not be paid by the customer for the time that the drilling unit is out of service also we may mobilize the drilling unit to another geographic market without a customer contract which will result in costs not reimbursable by future customers our business involves numerous operating hazards and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells such as blowouts reservoir damage loss of production loss of well control punchthroughs craterings fires and pollution the occurrence of these events such as events similar to the  incident in the us gulf of mexico involving the macondo well could result in the suspension of drilling or production operations claims by the operator and others affected by such events severe damage to or destruction of the property and    table of contents equipment involved injury or death to drilling unit personnel environmental damage and increased insurance costs we may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of drilling unit personnel as a result of our drilling operations operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns abnormal operating conditions failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages in addition our operations will be subject to perils peculiar to marine operations including capsizing grounding collision and loss or damage from severe weather severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our operations our drilling units could be damaged by high winds turbulent seas or unstable sea bottom conditions which could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until such damages are repaired damage to the environment and natural resources could result from our operations particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires we may also be subject to property environmental natural resource and other damage claims by host governments oil and natural gas companies and other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas as well as claims by individuals living in or around coastal areas as is customary in our industry the risks of our operations are partially covered by our insurance and partially by contractual indemnities from our customers however insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks moreover pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our drilling units including severe weather terrorist acts war civil disturbances pollution or environmental damage occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our offshore drilling operations could be adversely impacted by the macondo well incident and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity offshore drilling operations in the united states and elsewhere could be adversely impacted by the macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities after the macondo well incident the us department of the interior implemented a sixmonth moratoriumsuspension on certain drilling activities in water depths greater than  feet in the us gulf of mexico while the moratorium has since been lifted significant new requirements with respect to development and production activities in the us gulf of mexico have been imposed and the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallowwater areas have been delayed until it is confirmed that those requirements have been met these new requirements relate to the design of wells and testing of the integrity of wellbores the use of drilling fluids the functionality and testing of well control equipment including blowout preventers and other environmental and safety matters customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us consistent with standard industry practice our customers generally assume liability for and indemnify us against well control and subsurface risks under our dayrate contracts and we do not separately purchase insurance for such indemnified risks these risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well such as blowout or cratering for example the recent incident in the us gulf of mexico involving the macondo well the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution in the future we may not be able to obtain agreements from customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks or the indemnities that we do obtain may be limited in scope and duration including with respect to indemnification for punitive damages which may not be enforceable additionally even if our customers agree to indemnify us there can be no assurance that they will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all of these risks    table of contents our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurs as a result of the number and significance of catastrophic events in the offshore drilling industry in recent years such as hurricanes and spills in the gulf of mexico insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and increased restrictions on coverage and have made other coverages such as gulf of mexico windstorm coverage unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms while we believe we have reasonable policy limits of property casualty liability and business interruption insurance including coverage for acts of terrorism with financially sound insurers we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property casualty liability and business interruption insurance including coverage for severe weather terrorist acts war civil disturbances pollution or environmental damage would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur related to our property plant or equipment or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages when any of our coverage expires or when we seek coverage in the future we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage will be available offered at reasonable prices or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness additionally we do not have third party windstorm insurance for our drillship operating in the gulf of mexico and we may not have windstorm insurance for any vessel that we operate in the gulf of mexico in the future the occurrence of an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our drilling units could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor our liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages our international operations are subject to additional political economic and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations a primary component of our business strategy is to operate in international oil and natural gas producing areas our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign

forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control our financial condition and results of operations could be susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in the particular country or region in which we are active additionally we may experience currency exchange losses where at some future date revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not hedge exposure to a foreign currency we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available in the country of operation controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital many governments favor or effectively require that drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of or purchase supplies from a particular jurisdiction these practices may result in inefficiencies or put us at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts against local competitors our offshore contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units currency conversions and repatriation oil and natural gas exploration and development taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of drilling units and other equipment governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries in some areas of the world this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages many aspects of our operations are affected by governmental laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry including those requiring us to control the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of natural resources countries where we currently operate have environmental laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants and protection of the environment in connection with operations additionally any operations and activities in the united states and its territorial waters will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations including the clean water act the opa the outer continental shelf lands act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act and marpol failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit our operations laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability rendering us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed the application of these requirements the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and natural gas could materially limit future contract drilling opportunities or materially increase our costs in addition we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and regulations    table of contents in addition some financial institutions are imposing as a condition to financing requirements to comply with additional nongovernmental environmental and social standards in connection with operations outside the united states such as the equator principles a credit risk management framework for determining assessing and managing environmental and social risk in project finance transactions such additional standards could impose significant new costs on us which may materially and adversely affect us changes in us federal laws and regulations or in those of other jurisdictions where we operate including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages may adversely affect our operations if the us government amends or enacts new federal laws or regulations our potential exposure to liability for operations and activities in the united states and its territorial waters may increase although the oil pollution act of  provides federal caps on liability for pollution or contamination future laws and regulations may increase our liability for pollution or contamination resulting from any operations and activities we may have in the united states and its territorial waters including punitive damages and administrative civil and criminal penalties in addition other jurisdictions where we operate may also modify their laws and regulations in a manner that would increase our liability for pollution and other environmental damage new technology andor products may cause us to become less competitive the offshore contract drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling techniques and services using new technologies some of which may be subject to patent protection as competitors and others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage further we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost some of our competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources that may allow them to access technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technology or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost thus our inability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technology may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire or are unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms the acquisition of assets or businesses that we believe to be complementary to our drilling operations is an important component of our business strategy we believe that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time and that any such acquisition could be significant at any given time discussions with one or more potential sellers may be at different stages however any such discussions may not result in the consummation of an acquisition transaction and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisitions we cannot predict the effect if any that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our securities our business is capital intensive and any such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash we may need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings to execute our growth strategy and to fund acquisitions adequate sources of capital may not be available when needed on favorable terms if we raise additional capital by issuing additional equity securities existing shareholders may be diluted if our capital resources are insufficient at any time in the future we may be unable to fund acquisitions take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could harm our business any future acquisitions could present a number of risks including        the risk of using management time and resources to pursue acquisitions that are not successfully completed        the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations    table of contents      the risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely and        the risk of diversion of managements attention from existing operations or other priorities if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other operations or assets our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be unable to implement an important component of our business strategy successfully in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and costeffective manner our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues we do not expect operating and maintenance costs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrates however costs for operating a drilling unit are generally fixed or only semivariable regardless of the dayrate being earned in addition should the drilling units incur idle time between contracts we would typically maintain the crew to prepare the drilling unit for its next contract and would not reduce costs to correspond to the decrease in revenue during times of moderate activity reductions in costs may not be immediate as the crew may be required to prepare the drilling units for stacking after which time the crew will be reduced to a level necessary to maintain the drilling unit in working condition with the extra crew members assigned to active drilling units or dismissed in addition as drilling units are mobilized from one geographic location to another the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized the loss of some of our key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects our future operational performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of our management as well as marketing sales and operations personnel the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract retain and further motivate highly skilled management marketing sales and operations personnel we may experience intense competition for personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain key employees or that we will be successful in attracting assimilating and retaining personnel in the future failure to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers or an increase in labor costs could hurt our operations we require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services to and support for our drilling units in periods of increasing activity and when the number of operating units in our areas of operation increases either because of new construction reactivation of idle units or the mobilization of units into the region shortages of qualified personnel could arise creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel also could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work in addition our ability to expand operations depends in part upon our ability to increase the size of the skilled labor force    table of contents consolidation of suppliers may increase the cost of obtaining supplies which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we rely on certain third parties to provide supplies and services necessary for our offshore drilling operations including but not limited to drilling equipment suppliers catering and machinery suppliers recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies such consolidation combined with a high volume of drilling units under construction may result in a shortage of supplies and services thereby increasing the cost of supplies andor potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time or at all these cost increases delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in drilling unit downtime and delays in the repair and maintenance of our drilling units because the issuer does not have any independent officers it will rely upon officers and affiliates of parent to identify and evaluate its prospective drilling contracts the issuer does not have any employees and will rely entirely on parents employees to manage its business and operate its assets the parent and its affiliates are not obligated to present issuer with potential drilling contracts and are not restricted from competing with the issuer for potential contracts or other future assets not securing the notes because parent controls the issuer and all of the other guarantors the issuer will not be able to pursue or enter into any contract unless parent causes it to do so while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place we are still exposed to potential risks from the requirement that we evaluate our internal controls under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls as required by section  of the sarbanesoxley act we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification requirements of and preparing for the auditor attestation under section  as a result we have incurred additional expenses and a diversion of managements time while we have been able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section  in a timely fashion we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate in the future to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act or the foreign corrupt practices act if we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting we may be susceptible to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities changes in tax laws treaties or regulations effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws treaties and regulations both internationally and domestically tax laws treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation we are subject to changing tax laws treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate our income tax expense is based upon the interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred a change in these tax laws treaties or regulations or in the interpretation thereof could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings if any country successfully challenges our income tax filings based on our structure or the presence of our operations there or if we otherwise lose a material dispute our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our financial results could be materially adversely affected    table of contents we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our extensive training and compliance program we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that us and nonus laws and regulations prohibit us from using in order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions we utilize local agents and seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance if we are found to be liable for fcpa or similar nonus law violations either due to our own acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others including actions taken by our agents and our strategic or local partners even though our agents and partners may not be subject to the fcpa we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows we face various risks in our relationship with f capital and hsinchi su its owner as of september   on a fully diluted basis f capital owned approximately  of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants through his ownership of f capital hsinchi su a former director of the company has significant influence over all matters upon which shareholders may vote including the election of our directors the interests of f capital and mr su on the one hand and our shareholders on the other hand may differ and neither f capital nor mr su is under any fiduciary duty to consider the interests of our company or our shareholders in fact f capital and mr su may take action that they perceive benefits themselves and that may be detrimental to our other shareholders our debtholders and as a result our employees as well we have entered into various agreements with f capital and its affiliates that are publicly available and filed with the sec in addition f capital nominated four members of our board of directors because f capital is our largest shareholder our relationship could create or appear to create conflicts of interest including when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and f capital or its affiliates the appearance of such conflicts even if such conflicts do not materialize might adversely affect the publics perception of us the price of our securities as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business on august   we filed a lawsuit against mr su in the district court of harris county texas the complaint asserts breach of fiduciary duties fraud fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment and seeks to recover actual and punitive damages as well as other relief in each case relating to our past transactions with mr su and f capital including our joint venture with mandarin drilling company an entity owned and controlled by mr su our acquisition of the platinum explorer from mandarin drilling corporation and the financing thereof and our option to purchase the titanium explorer  as of the date of this prospectus we do not believe that mr su has filed a response or answer to the lawsuit we intend to vigorously pursue our claims but we cannot assure you as to the outcome of this legal action or that mr su will not file a counterclaim or other lawsuit against us f capital and mr su could bring legal actions against us to    table of contents preserve their own interests or make arguments that their interests have somehow been damaged by us among other things even if any such claims would be without merit for example they could claim that we violated an agreement with f capital or make any other legal or equitable claims against us we believe that any such claims would be without merit and we would contest them vigorously the fact that we have sued mr su may motivate f capital or mr su to take additional actions or positions that negatively impact the interests of other shareholders debtholders or employees including but not limited to voting against our existing board of directors when they stand for reelection finally even if we prevail in any of these legal proceedings we may not be able to collect any amounts or damages and these legal proceedings could result in the incurrence of significant legal and related expenses our ability to collect damages or recover legal and related expenses may be limited by several factors in addition to the outcome of the litigation including but not limited to our ability to enforce any such awards in the various jurisdictions where f capital and mr su maintain assets these risks and the perception of them could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our securities failure to timely commence contract operations for the titanium explorer may have a material and adverse effect on our business we have secured a drilling contract for the titanium explorer and have commenced acceptance testing with petrobras however if the titanium explorer is not acceptable to our customer or if we are unable to commence timely with the titanium explorer  our drilling contract could be cancelled andor we may be required to pay damages to our customer and our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected risks related to the notes our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent parent the issuer and the other guarantors from fulfilling obligations under the notes and the guarantees at september   after giving effect to this offering and the other transactions including the application of the proceeds of the offering of the old notes and the term loan parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would have had outstanding approximately  billion of senior indebtedness  billion of which would have been senior secured firstpriority indebtedness and would have had  million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement subject to the restrictions in the indenture governing the notes we may incur additional indebtedness our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences for an investment in us and significant effects on our business for example our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements may        make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations        prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase notes tendered to us if there is a change of control which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the notes        require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the notes and other debt which would reduce the funds available for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes        limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other investments or general corporate purposes which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy        heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions    table of contents      place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt        limit managements discretion in operating our business        limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business the industry in which we operate or the general economy and        result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our company and industry many of which are beyond our control the parent and the issuer may still be able to incur substantially more debt after the issuance of the notes this could exacerbate the risks associated with their substantial leverage even with our existing level of debt we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial amounts of additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future including debt under future credit facilities some or all of which may be secured on a first priority basis with the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations and to the extent that any such new indebtedness represents a permitted increase to our refinancing of our revolving credit agreement it will rank ahead of the notes for purposes of priority of payment from proceeds of collateral other than from insurance proceeds received as a result of an event of loss with respect to a vessel as a result any such debt could be secured by assets that secure the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations which could dilute the value of the collateral securing the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations or could be secured by assets of a subsidiary of parent that is not a guarantor of the notes which would be effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing any such debt as of the date of this prospectus we would have the ability to incur additional indebtedness under the indenture for the notes although the terms of the notes the notes guarantees and the other pari passu obligations will limit our ability to incur additional debt these terms do not and will not prohibit us from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt for specific purposes or under certain circumstances in addition the indenture governing the notes will allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which additional notes will also be guaranteed by the guarantors and will share in the collateral that will secure the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations we may also incur other additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equal to those securing the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations in which case the holders of that debt will be entitled to share equally with the holders of the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations in any proceeds distributed in connection with our winding up insolvency liquidation reorganization or dissolution if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify and could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage parent the issuer and the other guarantors may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet their debt service and other obligations including the notes and guarantees and other pari passu obligations due to events beyond their control the ability of parent the issuer and the other guarantors to generate cash flows from operations and to make scheduled payments on or refinance their indebtedness including the notes and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on the ability of parents subsidiaries including the issuer to generate cash in the future the future financial performance of parent and its subsidiaries will be affected by a range of economic financial competitive business and other factors that they cannot control such as general economic and financial conditions in their industry the economy generally or other risks summarized here a significant reduction in operating cash flows could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of    table of contents liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations prospects and the ability to service the debt and other obligations of parent the issuer and the guarantors including the notes the other pari passu obligations the f capital note and our convertible notes if parent or the issuer is unable to service their debt or to fund their other liquidity needs we may be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness seeking additional capital or any combination of the foregoing if parent the issuer or any other subsidiary raises additional debt it would increase interest expense leverage and operating and financial costs none of parent the issuer nor any other subsidiary can assure you that any of these alternative strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on the notes and other indebtedness of parent the issuer or any such subsidiaries or to fund their other liquidity needs reducing or delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay future cash flows in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements including the indenture governing the notes may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives the failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the value of the notes and the ability of parent the issuer and the guarantors to pay amounts due under the notes and the guarantees if for any reason parent the issuer or any other subsidiary is unable to meet their debt service and repayment obligations including under the notes parent the issuer or any such subsidiaries as applicable would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing their indebtedness which would allow creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable this would likely in turn trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault rights between their applicable debt agreements under these circumstances lenders could compel parent the issuer or any such subsidiaries as applicable to apply all of their available cash to repay borrowings or they could prevent parent the issuer or any such subsidiaries from making payments on the notes in addition these lenders could then seek to foreclose on the assets of parent the issuer or any such subsidiaries to the extent such assets are collateral for the borrowings if the amounts outstanding under existing and future debt agreements of parent the issuer or any other subsidiary including the other pari passu obligations were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions none of parent the issuer or any other guarantor can assure you that their assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to their other debt holders including you as a noteholder the parent and the issuer are holding companies and are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet their obligations the parent and the issuer currently conduct their operations through most of their assets are owned by and their operating income and cash flow are generated by their subsidiaries as a result cash from their subsidiaries is the principal source of funds necessary to meet their obligations under the notes and any future debt service obligations contractual provisions or laws as well as their subsidiaries financial condition and operating requirements may limit their ability to obtain cash from subsidiaries that they require to meet their debt service obligations including payments on the notes applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to them by their subsidiaries to further taxation the inability to transfer cash from their subsidiaries may mean that even though they may have sufficient resources on a consolidated basis to meet their obligations they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from their subsidiaries to meet such obligations the indentures governing the notes and the indenture governing the existing notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on parent and the issuer that may prevent parent and the issuer from capitalizing on business opportunities and restrict their ability to take some actions the indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the existing notes contain covenants that restrict the ability of parent and the issuer to take various actions such as        paying dividends redeeming subordinated indebtedness or making other restricted payments    table of contents      incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or with respect to restricted subsidiaries or any other subsidiary guarantor issuing preferred stock        creating or incurring liens        incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries        consummating a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all their assets        entering into transactions with affiliates        transferring or selling assets        engaging in business other than our current business and reasonably related extensions thereof        issuing capital stock of certain subsidiaries and        taking or omitting to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing our indebtedness the parent and the issuer may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of failure to meet certain ratios or because of the limitations imposed on them by the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes in addition the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes may also limit the ability of parent and the issuer to plan for or react to market conditions meet capital needs or otherwise restrict their activities or business plans and adversely affect their ability to finance their operations enter into acquisitions execute their business strategy effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in the interest of parent and the issuer parent and the issuer will also be subject to additional restrictions in the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and in the future may also incur additional debt obligations that might subject them to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further affect their financial and operational flexibility parent and the issuer cannot assure you that they will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason they are unable to comply with these agreements or that they will be able to refinance their debt on acceptable terms or at all the ability of parent and the issuer to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by events beyond their control and neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that they will satisfy those requirements a breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under the existing and future debt agreements of parent or the issuer including the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes the term loan or the revolving credit agreement which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable this would likely in turn trigger crossacceleration and crossdefault rights under the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes the term loan the revolving credit agreement and the terms of our other indebtedness outstanding at such time if the amounts outstanding in respect of the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations or any other indebtedness outstanding at such time were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that their assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to other debt holders particularly because some of the assets of parent the issuer and the guarantors will be excluded from the collateral securing the notes the issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes with cash upon a change of control or in connection with an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of an asset sale as required by the indenture upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the notes the issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a price equal to  of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest if any up to but not including the date of repurchase in connection with certain asset sales we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest if any up to but not including the date of repurchase in addition in  and  we may be required    table of contents to repurchase our convertible notes at the holders option and following a termination of trading event with respect to our ordinary shares we will be required to offer to repurchase our convertible notes the issuer may not have sufficient funds available to repurchase all of the notes and convertible notes tendered pursuant to any such offer and any other debt that would become payable upon a change of control or in connection with any asset sale offer including under the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations any of the instruments and agreements governing the pari passu obligations or any other future debt agreements of parent or the issuer may also limit their ability to repurchase the notes until all such debt is paid in full if the issuer fails to purchase the notes it would be a default under the indenture governing the notes and the convertible notes indenture which would in turn likely trigger a default under the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and any future debt agreements in addition the occurrence of a change of control may also constitute an event of default under our existing and any future debt agreements in that event parent or the issuer would need to cure or refinance the applicable debt agreements before making an offer to purchase moreover the issuer and parent anticipate that the existing or any future credit facility may restrict and any future indebtedness they incur may restrict the ability of the issuer to repurchase the notes and repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations including following a change of control the issuer and parent may be unable to repay all of that indebtedness or obtain a waiver of that type any requirement to offer to repurchase outstanding notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations may therefore require the issuer and parent to refinance other outstanding debt which may not be able to be done on commercially reasonable terms if at all these repurchase requirements may also delay or make it more difficult for others to obtain control of the issuer and parent certain important corporate events such as takeovers recapitalizations restructurings mergers or similar transactions may not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the notes and thus would not permit the holders of the notes to require the issuer to repurchase the notes in addition the definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of parent the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole or issuer and the restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole there is no precise definition of this phrase under applicable law accordingly in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of parent the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole or the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the holders of the notes have the right to require the issuer to repurchase such notes additionally the exercise by the holders of notes and the lenders or holders of other pari passu obligations of their right to require the issuer to repurchase the notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations upon an asset sale could cause a default under the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and any future debt agreements if the issuer is then prohibited by the terms of the applicable debt agreements from making the asset sale offer under any such instruments or agreements in the event an asset sale occurs at a time when the issuer is prohibited from purchasing notes or repurchasing or repaying any other pari passu obligations the issuer could seek the consent of its other applicable investors or lenders to the purchase of notes or the repurchase or repayment of any other pari passu obligations or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition if the issuer does not obtain a consent or repurchase or repay those borrowings the issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing notes or repurchasing or repaying any other pari passu obligations in that case the issuers failure to purchase tendered notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations would constitute an event of default under the indenture and the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations as applicable which would in turn likely constitute a default under the other indebtedness of the issuer and parent    table of contents as of the issue date of the notes not all of parents subsidiaries will be restricted subsidiaries or guarantors of the notes and parent and nonrestricted subsidiary guarantors will not be subject to all of the covenants of the indenture as of the issue date of the notes not all of parents subsidiaries will be restricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the notes and will not be guarantors of the notes which means that these excluded parent subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants and other provisions of the indenture and the collateral agreements in addition although parent and certain of its subsidiaries that are guarantors but not restricted subsidiaries will provide a guarantee of the notes they will only be subject to some covenants and other provisions of the indenture for example parent will not be subject to the restricted payments and asset sales covenants one consequence of this structure is that parent the nonrestricted guarantors and excluded parent subsidiaries may engage in transactions that increase their credit risk for example parent could invest in entities andor create new excluded parent subsidiaries to construct or purchase drillships or jackup rigs such as parent had with the tungsten explorer prior to completions of this offering and the other transactions contemplated hereby or have such subsidiaries finance the purchase of construction of drillships or jackup rigs with debt equity or equity linked securities the parent may also engage in certain transactions otherwise limited by the indenture and as a result parents guarantee would not be as strong as it otherwise would be absent such transactions in addition in the event of a liquidation insolvency bankruptcy or foreclosure relating to these excluded parent subsidiaries the holders of the notes may only have recourse to the assets of these companies by virtue of parents guarantee and parents ownership of the equity of these companies which means the holders of the notes will be effectively or structurally subordinated to holders of debt and other senior ranking instruments of these companies as a result holders of notes will only be able to look to the issuer the restricted subsidiaries and any other subsidiary guarantors as supported by parents guarantee as the credit structure supporting the notes if the notes are rated investment grade at any time by both standard  poors and moodys and no default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture certain covenants contained in the indenture will be suspended and the holders of the notes will lose the protection of these covenants the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that will be suspended and cease to have any effect from and after the first date when the notes are rated investment grade by both standard  poors and moodys see description of notescertain covenants these covenants restrict among other things our ability to incur additional debt make certain payments pay dividends sell certain assets and enter into certain types of transactions because these restrictions would not apply to the notes at any time the notes are rated investment grade the holders of the notes would not be able to prevent us from among other things incurring substantial additional debt if after these covenants are suspended standard  poors or moodys were to downgrade their ratings of the notes to a noninvestment grade level the covenants would be reinstated and the holders of the notes would again have the protection of these covenants however any indebtedness incurred or other transactions entered into during such time as the notes were rated investment grade would be permitted to remain in effect there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any portion of the notes including because the other holders of pari passu obligations will have pari passu liens on the collateral securing the notes and the other pari passu obligations the pari passu obligations including certain other secured indebtedness that we may incur in the future is or will be secured pursuant to the terms of the amended intercreditor agreement by pari passu first priority liens on the emerald driller  the sapphire driller  the topaz driller  the aquamarine driller  the platinum explorer  the titanium explorer and upon delivery the tungsten explorer  and by certain other of the issuers and the guarantors other than parents assets subject to certain exceptions including the exclusion of a pledge over any of our foreign accounts following repayment or repurchase of the existing notes permitted liens and the amended intercreditor agreement and by a pledge of stock of the issuer and the guarantors other than parent to be shared on a pari passu basis amongst the holders of our pari passu obligations including the notes    table of contents neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that the value of the collateral securing the notes the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations would be sufficient to pay any amounts due under the notes the note guarantees or any other pari passu obligations after payment in full of obligations under the revolving credit agreement if they were to be accelerated we have not prepared a valuation or appraisal of the assets constituting the collateral the value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions including the availability of suitable buyers for the collateral and the practical ability to foreclose on any such collateral would likely be costly by its nature some of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions competition or other future trends in addition the collateral securing the notes and note guarantees is subject to the pari passu liens securing the other pari passu obligations as permitted under the terms of the indenture and the amended intercreditor agreement and subject to the amended intercreditor agreement certain debt may rank senior in right of payment to the notes in some respects whether arising on or after the date the notes were issued therefore the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees but not always the proceeds thereof will be shared on a pari passu basis with the holders of the other pari passu obligations and other future debt and such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the collateral subject to such liens that if exercised could adversely affect the value of the collateral with respect to some of the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees the collateral agents security interest and ability to foreclose on the collateral will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements such as obtaining third party consents paying court fees that may be based on the principal amount of the pari passu obligations and making additional filings if we are unable to obtain these consents pay such fees or make these filings the security interests may be invalid and the applicable holders and lenders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto we cannot assure you that any such required consents fee payments or filings can be obtained on a timely basis or at all these requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral therefore the practical value of realizing on the collateral may without the appropriate consents fees and filings be limited in the event of a foreclosure liquidation bankruptcy or a similar proceeding neither the issuer nor parent can assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay the pari passu obligations including the notes in full or at all together with other claims that rank senior in right of payment and have first priority security interests in the shared collateral on a pari passu basis with the pari passu obligations if the proceeds of any sale of collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the pari passu obligations the holders of the notes and the holders and lenders of the other pari passu obligations to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of parent and the issuer and in the context of a bankruptcy case by or against parent and the issuer the holders of the notes may not be entitled to receive interest payments or reasonable fees costs or charges due under the notes and may be required to repay any such amounts already received by such holder in addition parent and the issuer may not perfect the liens on all of the collateral that is to secure the notes and the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations prior to the closing of this offering although we will enter into a further assurances covenant that will require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to do so furthermore the issuer will not be required to deposit any portion of the net proceeds from the transactions to be applied to the final construction payment of the tungsten explorer into an escrow account in which the holders of the notes would have a perfected first priority security interest prior to the release of such proceeds to fund such final construction payment for the tungsten explorer  which is not expected to be delivered until the second quarter of  as a result there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes or any other pari passu obligations any claim for the difference between the amount if any realized by holders or lenders of the pari passu obligations from the sale of the collateral securing the pari passu obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of our unsecured senior indebtedness and other obligations including trade payables    table of contents the indenture governing the notes will not require that parent and the issuer maintain the current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values releases of collateral from the liens securing the pari passu obligations will be permitted under some circumstances and may not require the collateral to be replaced under the amended and restated intercreditor agreement the trustee will lose the ability to direct the pari passu collateral agent to take enforcement actions under certain circumstances pursuant to the amended and restated intercreditor agreement the trustee initially is the sole controlling party for the purpose of directing the pari passu controlling actions to take enforcement actions relating to the common collateral however the trustee will lose this right and the term loan administrative agent will become the sole controlling party on the date that is  days after both the occurrence of an event of default under the term loan agreement and the receipt of written notice from the term loan administrative agent certifying that an event of default has occurred under the term loan agreement and that the term loan obligations are due and payable if the pari passu collateral agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the common collateral or if the issuer or any guarantor that owns the collateral is then a debtor under an insolvency proceeding the notice provided by the term loan administrative agent will be ineffective in addition the credit agreement agent will also have the right to become the sole controlling party if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the revolving credit agreement and at least  consecutive days have elapsed without the existing controlling parties diligently pursuing any enforcement action assuming that the issuer or guarantor that owns the collateral is not a debtor under an insolvency proceeding in order to exercise this stepin right the credit agreement agent needs to provide written notice that it desires to become the sole controlling party and certify that such event of default has occurred and is continuing and the obligations under the revolving credit agreement are due and payable in full in most circumstances the exercise of this stepin right by the revolving credit agent will prevail over any similar right of the term loan agent the collateral will be subject to casualty risks the parent and the issuer will be obligated under the indenture and collateral agreements governing the notes to maintain adequate insurance or otherwise insure against hazards as is customarily done by companies having assets of a similar nature in the same or similar localities there are however certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in whole or in part including windstorm insurance for drilling units operating in the gulf of mexico as a result it is possible that the insurance proceeds will not compensate parent and the issuer fully for their losses if there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that any insurance proceeds received by them or any of the guarantors will be sufficient to satisfy all of their secured obligations including the notes rights of holders of notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings the right of the collateral agent to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against parent or the issuer prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral under the us bankruptcy code a secured creditor such as the collateral agent for the holders of the notes is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor without bankruptcy court approval moreover bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral and the proceeds products rents or profits of the collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection the meaning of the term adequate protection may vary according to circumstances but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditors interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines for any diminution in the value of    table of contents the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case in view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court it is impossible to predict how long payments under the notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case whether or when the collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the collateral and whether or to what extent holders of the notes or holders or lenders under any other instruments or agreements governing pari passu obligations would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of adequate protection furthermore in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes or other pari passu obligations the holders of the notes and holders of other pari passu obligations would have undersecured claims as to the difference us federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest costs and attorneys fees for undersecured claims during the debtors bankruptcy case additionally the collateral agents ability to foreclose on the collateral on behalf of the holders of pari passu obligations may be subject to the consent of third parties prior liens and practical problems associated with the realization of the trustees security interest in the collateral moreover the debtor or trustee in a bankruptcy case may seek to void an alleged security interest in collateral for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate it may successfully do so if the security interest is not properly perfected or was perfected within a specified period of time generally  days prior to the initiation of such proceeding under such circumstances a creditor may hold no security interest and be treated as holding a general unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case it is impossible to predict what recovery if any would be available for such an unsecured claim if the issuer or parent became a debtor in a bankruptcy case while us bankruptcy law generally invalidates provisions restricting a debtors ability to assume andor assign a contract there are exceptions to this rule which could be applicable in the event that the issuer or parent become subject to a us bankruptcy proceeding there also can be no assurance that courts outside of the united states would recognize the us bankruptcy courts jurisdiction accordingly difficulties may arise in administering a us bankruptcy proceeding against the issuer or any of the guarantors with property located outside of the united states and any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court in the united states may not be enforceable in any foreign jurisdiction in which the issuer or any of the guarantors are organized the rights of the collateral agent to enforce remedies may be significantly impaired by the restructuring or liquidation provisions of applicable jurisdictional bankruptcy laws insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to the issuer or parent the risks outlined above regarding the difficulty of pursuing property that is collateral and that is located outside the united states is particularly relevant for parent the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries since the drilling units that will serve as significant collateral for the notes and guarantees and the other pari passu obligations is often if not usually outside the united states further the holders of the notes may receive in exchange for their claims a recovery that could be substantially less than the amounts of their claims potentially even nothing and any such recovery might consist of illiquid securities any future pledge of collateral may be avoidable in bankruptcy any future pledge of collateral in favor of the trustee or collateral agent including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the indenture governing the notes may be avoidable by the pledgor a debtor in possession or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur including among others if        the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge        the pledge permits the holder of the notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and        a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within  days following the pledge or in certain circumstances a longer period    table of contents a financial failure by parent the issuer or any of parents other subsidiaries may result in the assets of any or all of those entities becoming subject to the claims of all creditors of those entities a financial failure by parent the issuer or any of parents other subsidiaries could affect payment of the notes and other pari passu obligations if a bankruptcy court were to substantively consolidate parent the issuer and some or all of parents other subsidiaries if a bankruptcy court substantively consolidated parent the issuer and some or all of parents other subsidiaries the assets of each entity would become subject to the claims of creditors of all entities such a ruling would expose holders of notes and other pari passu obligations not only to the usual impairments arising from bankruptcy but also to potential dilution of the amount ultimately recoverable because of the larger creditor base furthermore a forced restructuring of the notes could occur through the cramdown provisions of the us bankruptcy code under those provisions the notes could be restructured over holders objections as to their interest rate maturity and other general terms rights of holders of notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on the collateral or on collateral acquired in the future the failure to properly perfect liens on the collateral could adversely affect the collateral agents ability to enforce its rights with respect to the collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the other pari passu obligations in addition applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest or lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified there can be no assurance that the trustee or the collateral agent will monitor or that the issuer or parent will inform the trustee or the collateral agent of the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired collateral the trustee and the collateral agent have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein such failure may result in the loss of the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the notes against third parties if the issuer parent or any future guarantors were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding after the issue date of the notes any liens recorded or perfected after the issue date of the notes would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded or perfected on the issue date if a lien is recorded or perfected after the issue date it may be treated under bankruptcy law as if it were delivered to secure previously existing debt in bankruptcy proceedings commenced within  days of lien perfection a lien given to secure previously existing debt is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the notes accordingly if the issuer parent or any future guarantors were to file for bankruptcy after the issue date of the notes and the liens had been perfected less than  days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding the liens securing the notes may be especially subject to challenge as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the notes to the extent that such challenge succeeded you would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide the issuer will receive the net proceeds of this offering together with the proceeds of the term loan at the closing but expects to use a portion of such proceeds for the final construction payment for the tungsten explorer after closing and to take delivery of the tungsten explorer in the second quarter of  as a result until the issuer or the applicable guarantor takes delivery of the tungsten explorer and the vessel is flagged registered and mortgaged in favor of the holders of the notes and other pari passu collateral it will not be part of the collateral consequently if there is a bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization involving the issuer and the relevant subsidiary that will own the tungsten explorer  noteholders will not have the benefit of having the tungsten explorer be part of the collateral in addition pursuant to the terms of the indenture the applicable subsidiary that takes delivery of the tungsten explorer will have  business days to become a guarantor if such subsidiary is not a guarantor at the time of such delivery with respect to drilling units flagged under panamanian law the panamanian recording procedure that will govern the part of the collateral that constitute panamanian ship mortgages provides for a provisional registration    table of contents of the panamanian ship mortgages with the panamanian ship registry valid for a sixmonth period prior to the end of that sixmonth period the panamanian ship mortgages must be translated into spanish and protocolized by a panamanian notary in order to be permanently registered with the panamanian ship registry with a priority relationback date to the date of the provisional registration we are responsible for the permanent registration of the panamanian ship mortgages in panama and if we fail to complete that permanent registration within the sixmonth period the security constituted by the panamanian ship mortgages will lapse and will no longer be valid or enforceable there are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the notes and guarantees will be released automatically without holders consent or the consent of the trustee under the indenture governing the notes under various circumstances some of the collateral securing the notes will be released automatically including        a sale transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the notes        with respect to a contract unwind trigger as such term is defined in the indenture governing the notes        with respect to the collateral held by a guarantor upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee        to the extent required in accordance with any intercreditor agreement and        to the extent we have defeased or satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the notes in addition a guarantee will be automatically released in connection with a sale of such guarantor or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of that guarantor in each case in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the notes the indenture governing the notes will also permit the board of directors of parent to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary if the board of directors of parent designates a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture governing the notes designations of any unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released in addition the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have claims to the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries that are senior to any claims of the holders of notes foreclosing on the collateral may be difficult most or all of the collateral securing the notes the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations will be located outside of the united states in particular the emerald driller  the sapphire driller  the topaz driller  the aquamarine driller  the platinum explorer  the titanium explorer and the tungsten explorer are highly mobile and are or may be located in international waters outside the jurisdiction of any court if the issuer defaults under the indenture or if a guarantor defaults under its guarantee subject to limitations in the amended intercreditor agreement the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may direct the trustee to instruct the collateral agent to bring a foreclosure action against the defaulting party we cannot assure you that the collateral or the guarantees will be located in a jurisdiction having effective or favorable foreclosure procedures and lien priorities particularly if it is routinely in transit any foreclosure proceedings could be subject to lengthy delays resulting in increased custodial costs deterioration in the condition of the collateral and substantial reduction of the value of such collateral in addition some jurisdictions may not provide a legal remedy for the enforcement of mortgages on the collateral our vessels that are part of the collateral will be operated by us worldwide as our business demands consequently the respective laws of each jurisdiction where a vessel is actually located at the time the collateral    table of contents agent may seek to enforce the ship mortgage will govern the foreclosure proceedings and distribution of proceeds such laws may vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction furthermore all or some of those laws and procedures may be less favorable to mortgagees than those in other jurisdictions and may be less favorable than those applicable in the united states the costs of enforcement in foreign jurisdictions particularly if proceedings are ongoing simultaneously against vessels in different jurisdictions can be high and can include fees based on the face amount of the mortgages being enforced foreign court proceedings can also be slow and have unexpected procedural hurdles priorities accorded maritime lien claims and ship mortgages can vary in foreign jurisdictions and some jurisdictions prefer certain local claimants such as local suppliers of operating necessaries to foreign claimants such as the collateral agent or mortgagee consequently there are no assurances that the collateral agent will be able to enforce any one or more of the ship mortgages covering vessels that are located outside the united states maritime liens may arise and take priority over the liens securing the notes the laws of the various jurisdictions in which the emerald driller  the sapphire driller  the topaz driller  the aquamarine driller  the platinum explorer  the titanium explorer and the tungsten explorer may operate may give rise to the existence of maritime liens which may take priority over the ship mortgages and other liens securing the notes and the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations such liens may arise in support of among other things claims by unpaid ship repairers remaining in possession of such collateral claims for salvage claims for damage caused by a collision claims for seamens wages and other employment benefits and claims for pilotage as well as potential claims for necessary goods and services supplied to such collateral this list should not be regarded as definitive or exhaustive as the categories of claims giving rise to maritime liens and the ranking of such liens vary from one jurisdiction to another maritime liens can attach without any court action notice registration or documentation and accordingly their existence cannot necessarily be identified us federal state and foreign fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and require noteholders to return payments received if this occurs noteholders may not receive any payments on the notes us federal state and foreign fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of any guarantees under us federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws which may vary from state to state and be different from other applicable foreign jurisdictions the notes or guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if  the issuer or any of the guarantors as applicable issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering delaying or defrauding creditors or  the issuer or any of the guarantors as applicable received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and in the case of  only one of the following is also true at the time thereof        the issuer or any of the guarantors as applicable were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees        the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left the issuer or any of the guarantors as applicable with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business        the issuer or any of the guarantors intended to or believed that the issuer or such guarantor would incur debts beyond the issuers or such guarantors ability to pay such debts as they mature or        the issuer or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against the issuer or such guarantor if in either case after final judgment the judgment is unsatisfied a court would likely find that the issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee if the issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee as a general matter value is given for a    table of contents transfer or an obligation if in exchange for the transfer or obligation property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied a debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor the issuer cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not it or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or regardless of the standard that a court uses that the issuance of the guarantees would not be further subordinated to the other debt of the issuer or of the guarantors generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if at the time it incurred indebtedness        the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets        the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or        it could not pay its debts as they become due if a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or of the related guarantor or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantee in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred noteholders may not receive any repayment on the notes further the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to other debt of parent and its subsidiaries that could result in acceleration of such debt although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce that guarantors obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless in addition different or additional fraudulent conveyance laws may exist in foreign jurisdictions which could result in the liens being avoided if the guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are not enforceable the notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiary guarantors including trade payables the notes currently have no established trading market and an active trading market may not develop for the notes which could affect the liquidity and value of the notes and you may not be able to sell the notes readily or at all or at or above the price that you paid the notes have no established trading market the issuer does not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system the initial purchasers have advised parent and the issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time in their sole discretion even if a registration statement becomes effective to cover the notes parent and the issuer cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes or if one does develop that it will be liquid if the notes are traded they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates the market for similar securities parents and the issuers credit ratings parents and the issuers operating performance and financial condition and other factors if an active trading market does not develop the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected as a result parent and the issuer cannot ensure you that you will be able to sell any of the notes at a particular time at attractive prices or at all thus you may be required to bear the financial risk of your investment in the notes indefinitely    table of contents if a trading market were to develop future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors including        the operating performance and financial condition or prospects of parent and the issuer        the prospects for companies in the industry of parent and the issuer generally        the number of holders of the notes        prevailing interest rates        the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them        the market for similar securities and the overall securities market and        the ability of the issuer to complete the offer to exchange the notes in addition the market for noninvestment grade debt has historically been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes any such disruptions could adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes in addition subsequent to their initial issuance the notes may trade at a discount from the initial offering price of the notes depending on the prevailing interest rates the market for similar notes our performance and other factors many of which are beyond our control as a result we cannot ensure you that you will be able to sell any of the notes at a particular time at attractive prices or at all thus you may be required to bear the financial risk of your investment in the notes indefinitely the trading prices for the notes and the availability costs and terms and conditions of our debt will be directly affected by our credit rating the notes will be and any of our future debt instruments may be publicly rated by moodys investors service inc or moodys standard  poors rating services or sp and other independent rating agencies a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities these public debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt any future downgrading of the notes or our debt by moodys and sp or another rating agency may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading price of the notes because the issuer and parent and certain restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands you may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited parent the issuer and certain restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are exempted companies incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands and substantially all of their assets are located outside the united states in addition most of parents the issuers and such restricted subsidiaries and guarantors directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of their assets may be located outside the united states further enforcement of the note guarantees issued and the collateral pledged may be subject to certain limitations under cayman islands law and the laws of various other foreign jurisdictions as a result it may be difficult for holders of notes to effect service of process within the united states upon nonus directors or executive officers or enforce judgments obtained in the us courts against nonus directors or executive officers the corporate affairs of parent the issuer and certain restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are governed by their memorandum and articles of association the companies law  revision as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time of the cayman islands and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of holders of the notes to take action against directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of directors under cayman islands law are to a large extent governed by the    table of contents common law of the cayman islands the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from english common law the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands the rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of directors under cayman islands law are different from those under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the cayman islands has a different body of securities laws which may provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware which have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law the cayman islands courts are also unlikely        to recognize or enforce against parent and the issuer judgments of courts of the united states based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws and        to impose liabilities against parent and the issuer in original actions brought in the cayman islands based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws that are penal in nature additionally cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states there is no statutory recognition in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the cayman islands recognize and enforce a nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without reexamination of the merits of the underlying dispute provided such judgment        is final        imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given        is not in a respect of taxes a fine or a penalty and        was neither obtained in a manner nor is of a kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the cayman islands the grand court of the cayman islands may

provisions that may afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction    table of contents future agreements governing indebtedness of parent the issuer or their respective subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events including events that would constitute a change of control or an asset sale and including repurchases or other prepayments in respect of the notes the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the issuer to repurchase the notes upon a change of control or asset sale or upon a mandatory redemption upon event of loss of a vessel could cause a default under these other agreements even if the change of control or asset sale or event giving rise to the mandatory redemption upon event of loss of a vessel itself does not due to the financial effect of such repurchases or redemption on parent the issuer or their respective subsidiaries in the event a change of control asset sale or event giving rise to the mandatory redemption upon event of loss of a vessel occurs at a time when the issuer is prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes the issuer could seek the consent of its other applicable debt holders or lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition if the issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings the issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing notes in that case the issuers failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture which could in turn constitute a default under other indebtedness of the issuer finally the issuers ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase or redemption may be limited by the issuers then existing financial resources
