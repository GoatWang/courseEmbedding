business has been helping companies manage their it assets in october  alphapoint acquired  of the outstanding equity of str ltd in exchange for  shares of its common stock and a promissory note in the amount of  str ltd was founded in  to provide revenue acceleration solutions to large organizations through the performance improvement and effective execution of their sales teams subsequently the parties to the sea believe that the intended benefits have not been realized and agreed to unwind the transaction and negotiated and finalized the terms of an unwind agreement the unwind the agreement became effective on may   which essentially unwound the sea alphapoint management is currently seeking alternative opportunities in line with their original strategy of acquiring a business in the technology sector that is capable of growth and development application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the application of gaap requires our management to make assumptions judgments and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and the related disclosures regarding these items we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial condition or results of operations will be affected on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts stockbased compensation valuation of acquired intangible assets goodwill impairment longlived asset impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates historically our assumptions judgments and estimates in accordance with our critical accounting policies have not materially differed from actual results for a more detailed discussion of these accounting policies and our use of estimates refer to note  of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including fasb asc  research and development fasb asc  internaluse software fasb  costs of computer software to be sold leased or marketed and fasb asc  website development costs    costs incurred during the period of planning and design prior to the period determining technological feasibility for all software developed for use internal and external has been charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs additionally costs incurred after determination of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development the company has capitalized certain costs in the development of our proprietary software computer software to be sold leased or licensed for the period after technological feasibility was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales website development costs have been capitalized under the same criteria as our marketed software capitalized software costs are stated at cost the estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project and is currently being amortized over three to five years at december   all software and website development costs had been fully amortized longlived assets and intangible property longlived assets such as property equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset the fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset when fair values are not available the company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets the company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented sharebased payments sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options or shares of stock are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values in accordance with fasb asc topic  that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period the company may issue restricted stock to consultants for various services cost for these transactions is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of the common stock is to be measured at the earlier of i the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or ii the date at which the counterpartys performance is complete the fair value of the companys common stock is obtained from the trading prices on or near the date of the transaction the company may issue shares as compensation in the future period for services associated with the registration of the common shares during  the company issued  shares of common stock to an officer of the company for services provided in addition  shares were issued to a service provider for services rendered compensation expense related to these stock grants totaled approximately  goodwill intangible assets longlived assets and impairment assessments goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting goodwill is not amortized but instead goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and under certain circumstances the company performs such testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the company currently has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that is a likelihood of more than  that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the impairment test is unnecessary the company completed its assessment of the qualitative factors as of december   and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value there is no goodwill at december      intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives refer to note  of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed discussion on useful lives over which our intangible assets are amortized generally amortization is based on the straightline method there was no impairment expense related to intangible assets during  or  the company also evaluates the recoverability of its longlived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if such review indicates that the carrying amount of longlived assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value there were no impairment charges recorded during  or  foreign currency the assets and liabilities of str for which the local currency is the functional currency pound sterling are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date and income and

loss included within stockholders equity gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive loss comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation for the year ended december   was  and transaction gains totaled  for the period from acquisition to december   results of operations for the years ended december   and  our consolidated revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively the decrease in revenues from  is the result of a full year of recognition of deferred revenue in  not available in  operating expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively the increase year over year expenses was mainly due to the acquisition of the str business which entailed higher costs for compensation and professional fees net losses incurred in the periods presented have been primarily due to losses from discontinued operations and operating costs the company incurred net losses of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively the decrease in the year over year net loss was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses resulting mainly from the acquisition of str offset by the gain on disposal of discontinued operations we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a technology business enterprise including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies see risk factors to become profitable and competitive we must develop the business and marketing plan and execute the plan our management will attempt to secure financing through various means including borrowing and investment from institutions and private individuals liquidity and capital resources as reflected in the audited financial statements at december   we have a deficit in working capital an accumulated deficit and for the year ended december   we have a net loss and comprehensive loss at december   the company had current assets of  including  in cash and  in prepaids and other assets and current liabilities of  resulting in a working capital deficit of  until october   we depended on advances from shareholders to meet any shortfall in meeting our obligations however we will require working capital to meet our current shortfall in working capital if the company is unable to raise the funds partially through stock offerings the company will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such funds    consequently there is doubt about the companys ability to continue to operate as a going concern as reflected in the financial statements we have an accumulated deficit from inception of  and have a net loss from operations of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the companys ability to raise additional capital and execution of its business plan the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern if we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds for whatever reason to fund our operations the company may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or another entity with which we could create a joint venture management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and execution of its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern recent federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics our board of directors consists of eight  individuals who advise our chief executive officer our chief executive officer makes decisions on all significant corporate matters such as the approval of terms of the compensation of our executive officers the company has adopted a code of ethics and business conduct the company is in the process of introducing them the company has not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committees of our board of directors if we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors the company may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our board of directors it is possible that if our board of directors included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct for example in the absence of audit nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions recent accounting pronouncements see note  in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders management consideration of alternative business strategies in order to continue to protect and increase shareholder value management believes that it may from time to time consider alternative management strategies to create value for the company or additional revenues strategies to be reviewed may include acquisitions rollups strategic alliances joint ventures on large projects andor mergers management will only consider these options where it believes the result would be to increase shareholder value while continuing the viability of the company inflation the effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved
