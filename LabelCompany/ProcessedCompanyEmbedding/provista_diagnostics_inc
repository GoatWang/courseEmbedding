breast cancer centers across the united states and included women ages  who had a birads  probably benign or birads  suspicious finding on imaging the goal of this study was to develop a blood based diagnostic test consisting of multiple serum protein biomarkers and tumor associated autoantibodies to aid in the detection of breast cancer data from this study demonstrated the ability of provistas biomarker assay to accurately detect the presence or absence of invasive breast cancer andor dcis with a high sensitivity specificity negative predicative value npv and positive predictive value ppv  provistas technology is not only groundbreaking as a complimentary diagnostic but is also backed by strong prospective clinical trial data said dr lourenco i chose to present their findings because i wanted to ensure my fellow radiologists learned of it with this data provista has developed videssa® breast a proteinbased blood test that can accurately detect the presence or absence of breast cancer videssa® breast detects breast cancer rather than assessing a patients risk for developing cancer in the future by identifying early warning signals of breast cancer called biomarkers the combination of this proteomic approach with traditional imaging provides concrete biochemical evidence allowing for improved diagnostic accuracy and greater confidence in clinical decisionmaking provistas diagnostic test can help determine when further clinical evaluation is warranted theoretically decreasing the rate of false positive and false negative results provista is honored to have dr

exclusive license agreement for biodesign biomarker technologies       provista diagnostics expands exclusive license agreement for biodesign biomarker technologies share this provista diagnostics expands exclusive license agreement for biodesign biomarker technologies may   download photo may     provista diagnostics inc a molecular diagnostics company developing and commercializing proteomicbased diagnostic prognostic and monitoring tests for cancers affecting women today announced it has expanded its exclusive license agreement for certain biomarker and autoantibody technologies identified by researchers joshua labaer md phd and karen anderson md phd of the biodesign institute of arizona state university  the license provides provista with access to patents proprietary technology materials processing techniques and protocols necessary for detection of certain autoantibodies and use of certain biomarkers  this agreement expands provistas evaluation license allowing full use of these technologies for further research and development of diagnostics products for early detection of breast cancer ovarian cancer and human papillomavirus  the first agreement signed in october of  allowed for the initial evaluation of applicability for this purpose  this is an important next step in signifying the potential clinical and market viability of our research and development focus said dr david e reese president and chief executive officer of provista  the technologies were discovered at harvard university medical school and danafarber cancer institute and completed at asu biodesign institute in the laboratories of joshua labaer md phd and karen anderson md phd these advances are important to provistas diagnostics strategy the combination of these biomarkers with our proprietary assays is important in the development of proteomic tests for early cancer detection biomarkers are substances within the body that can indicate the presence of a disease prior to the clinical manifestation of symptoms they can help detect cancer at an early stage which has been shown to significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival  for example according to the american cancer society when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at an early stage the fiveyear survival rate is greater than  percent  however fewer than one in five cases are detected at an early stage because symptoms are typically minimal and invasive surgery is required for diagnosis  to date no screening biomarkers are recommended for the general population in detecting ovarian cancer in the case of breast cancer while there have been advances in detection and treatment the disease remains a common and devastating health problem that can be difficult to diagnose according to the american cancer society almost one in eight women in the us will develop breast cancer and these are frequently not diagnosed until a late stage the prospect for diagnostic tools to pinpoint biomarkers indicating the presence of cancers that have otherwise been undetectable presents a major opportunity for improved clinical care said dr joshua labaer director of the virginia g piper center for personalized diagnostics at the biodesign institute at asu we are pleased provista sees the value of our research as we strongly believe that earlier disease detection offers the potential to not only save more patient lives but to greatly reduce treatment burdens and health system costs the licensing agreement was brokered by arizona technology enterprises azte
