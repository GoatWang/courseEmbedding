economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

global aggregate bond index is an unmanaged index of global investmentgrade fixedincome securities you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets you can lose money by investing in the fund credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets as of the date indicated above a bond rated bbb or higher a or higher

bond index is an unmanaged index of global investmentgrade fixedincome securities you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the

government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

bond index is an unmanaged index of global investmentgrade fixedincome securities you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

bond index is an unmanaged index of global investmentgrade fixedincome securities you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced

securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value when interest rates decline and decline in value when interest rates rise the fund invests in fewer issuers or concentrates its investments by region or sector and involves more risk than a more broadly invested fund the funds policy of concentrating on a limited group of industries and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest in fewer issuers can increase the funds vulnerability to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility bond

is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations
