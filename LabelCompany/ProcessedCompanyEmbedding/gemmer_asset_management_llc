through sound investment strategies comprehensive backoffice support and high levels of personalized service we pride ourselves on the strength of the partnerships we have with advisors and in turn helping them partner successfully with their clients    when he decided to open the doors of the firm that bears his name david gemmer knew that it was virtually impossible for an advisor to become an expert in everything – portfolio management estate planning insurance marketing reporting etc – and also to give clients the attention they need and deserve gemmer’s model therefore was to provide a full suite of “outsourced” services for advisors enabling them to focus on their own clients while growing their businesses    back then the concept of “outsourcing” asset management services was virtually unheard of today an entire industry has evolved around this business and as the industry has grown so too has gemmer today as a wholly employeeowned firm we are committed to working with our

that bears his name david gemmer knew that it was virtually impossible for an advisor to become an expert in everything – portfolio management estate planning insurance marketing reporting etc – and also to give clients the attention they need and deserve gemmer’s model therefore was to provide a full suite of “outsourced” services for advisors enabling them to focus on their own clients while growing their businesses    back then the concept of “outsourcing” asset management services was virtually unheard of today an entire industry has evolved around this business and as the industry has grown so too has gemmer today as a wholly employeeowned firm we are committed to working with our advisors to provide objective portfolio management and a level of customization not found anywhere
