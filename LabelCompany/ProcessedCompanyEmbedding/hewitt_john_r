to wait more than  minutes we pay you we truly do put the customer first our dedication to unparalleled customer service and delivering the wow factor is what we call the liberty edge  we deliver the little unexpected extras that make people take notice and feel appreciated how and when did you decide on liberty tax service it really did start on a napkin some of my most trusted colleagues and i sat down and wrote on the back of a napkin  things we would do differently from what we had done in the past to create an environment of success we wanted to take on the lb gorilla in hr block and the company that bore my name jackson hewitt people thought we were crazy  insane but we vowed to implement some of those  ideas we acted on what we knew was the right way to do business and we succeeded what was your background prior to liberty tax service when i was  years old i started a job as a tax preparer and it was the most interesting job i had ever had i enjoyed the work immensely and it showed i quickly climbed the ranks becoming a district manager and then the youngest regional director in hr block history at the time of course i then went on to found jackson hewitt what are some of

the tax market of the  million tax returns filed by americans each year  of those pay someone to prepare and file their tax return for them in this economy some mom and pop tax service shops are

track record remember the two certainties in life death and taxes well we must also embrace the third certainty  change while other companies flounder to understand market changes at liberty tax we respond and move forward what are some of the greatest lessons youve learned in growing this franchise that im still learning in starting a business you need to really test your concepts and ideas test test and retest be willing to go back to the drawing board also treat your employees as if they are your best paying customer because in reality they are the daytoday representatives of your company and probably the most important lesson i learned when you put your heart and soul into a company always have a controlling interest do you have a mentor and is there someone you use for inspiration my father was a great mentor he advised me on when to get in and when to get out of a career situation we were both visionaries he showed me the vision of computerized tax preparation and when we couldnt convince hr block to buy our program he convinced me to start my own retail tax company he was a great supporter and motivator what advice do you have for someone looking to acquire a franchise the passion has to be there you have to be committed to your success follow the system that the franchisor has put in place and follow the advice they give be prepared to trust the experts
