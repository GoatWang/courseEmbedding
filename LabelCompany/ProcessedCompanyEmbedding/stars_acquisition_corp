amounts held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  over a month period assuming an interest rate of approximately  per year  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination we do not anticipate any change in the categories of our intended use of proceeds wai fun cheng ren hua zheng and ying chenand chardan capital markets llc have committed that they will purchase the private units for an aggregate purchase price of  from us on a private placement basis that will occur simultaneously with the consummation of this offering they have also agreed that if the overallotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part they andor their designees will purchase from us at a price of  per unit the number of private units up to a maximum of  private units that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to  per share of common stock sold to the public in this offering all of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be placed in a trust account in the united states at jp morgan chase maintained by american stock transfer  trust company llc as trustee the funds held in the trust account will be invested only in united states government treasury bills bonds or notes having a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under

respect to  interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and  interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital requirements the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period the proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business no compensation of any kind including finder’s fees consulting fees or other similar compensation will be paid to our insiders members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after our initial business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after our initial business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be approximately  in addition interest earned on the funds held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination we intend to use the aftertax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our insiders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available to us represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our insiders members of our management team or third parties but our insiders members of our management team or third parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account in connection with our initial business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto including the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to chardan capital markets llc in an amount equal to  of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination to the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient wai fun cheng ren hua zheng richard xu and tom w su have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of may   ren hua zheng our director loaned us  to repay the then outstanding  loan which had been used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the sec registration fee finra filing fee the nonrefundable portion of the nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses this resulted in our having actual liabilities of  as of may   the prior note was repaid on june   the loans are payable without interest on the consummation of the proposed public offering we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds which includes amounts that may be released to us from the trust account to operate for up to the next  months assuming that our initial business combination is not consummated during that time however if necessary in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering our insiders officers and directors andor their designees may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of  per unit our stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete a business combination any loans and advances from our insiders officers and directors or their affiliates will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account if any a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of  our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period  if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a stockholder vote or  if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses • our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction • our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination • our outstanding rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent • our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to chardan capital markets llc upon consummation of our initial business combination • our obligation to either repay working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders officers directors or their affiliates • our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private units and underlying securities and any shares issued to our insiders officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans and • the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial business combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting our initial business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business subsequent to our initial business combination we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company formed under the laws of the state of delaware on may   we were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger share exchange asset acquisition stock purchase recapitalization reorganization or other similar business combination which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a target business to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region although we intend to focus our search on target businesses being operated by andor serving ethnic minorities in the united states especially within asianamerican communities we have not selected any target business for our initial business combination and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf directly or indirectly engaged in any substantive discussions with a target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us  our executive offices
