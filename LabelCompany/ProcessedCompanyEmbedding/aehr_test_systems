fox full wafer contact parallel test and burnin systems waferpak full wafer contactor the diepak carrier and test fixtures the company develops manufactures and sells systems which are designed to perform reliability screening or burnin of complex logic devices memory integrated circuits ics sensors and optical devices these systems can be used to perform parallel testing and burnin of packaged ics singulated bare die or ics still in wafer formthe companys abts family of packaged part burnin and test systems perform test during burnin of devices such as digital signal processors microprocessors microcontrollers and systemsonachip and offers individual temperature control for highpower advanced logic devices the fox systems are full wafer contact parallel test and burnin systems designed to make contact with all pads of a wafer the waferpak cartridge includes a fullwafer probe card for use in testing wafers in fox systems the diepak carrier is a reusable temporary package that enables ic manufacturers to perform final test and burnin of singulated bare die the company markets and sells its products throughout the world to semiconductor manufacturers semiconductor contract assemblers electronics manufacturers and burnin and test service companiesfull wafer contact systemsthe companys foxp full wafer parallel test system is designed for parallel test in wafer sort the foxp system is designed to make electrical contact to and test all of the die on a wafer in a single touchdown the foxp pattern generator is designed to functionally test memory devices such as flash and dynamic randomaccess memory drams it is also optimized to test memory or logic ics that incorporate design for testability dft and builtin selftest bist the foxxp full wafer contact test and burnin system is designed for use with wafers that require test and burnin times typically measured in hours the foxxp system is focused on parallel testing and burningin approximately  wafers at a time the fox full wafer parallel test system is designed for fullwafer test and burnin one of the key components of the fox systems is the waferpak cartridge system the waferpak cartridge contains a fullwafer singletouchdown probe card another key component of foxxp and fox test cell is the waferpak aligner the waferpak aligner performs automatic alignment of the customers wafer to the waferpak cartridge so that the wafer can be tested and burnedin by the foxxp and fox systems typically one waferpak aligner can support several foxxp or fox systemssystems for packaged partsthe companys test during burnin tdbi systems consists of several subsystems including pattern generation and test electronics control software network interface and environmental chamber the test pattern generator allows duplication of the functional tests performed by a traditional tester pin electronics at each burnin board bib position are designed to provide signals to the ics being tested and detect whether a device is failing the test the companys abts family of products is focused on addressing devices the abts system can test and burnin both highpower logic and lowpower ics it can be configured to provide individual device temperature control for devices approximately  watts or more and with approximately  inputoutput io channels the companys max system family monitors burnin of memory and logic devicestest fixturesthe company sells and licenses others to manufacture and sell test fixtures for its systems the test fixtures include bibs for the abts parallel test and burnin system and for the max monitored burnin system these test fixtures hold the devices undergoing test or burnin and electrically connect the devices under test to the system electronics the capacity of each test fixture depends on the type of device being tested or burnedin ranging from several hundred in memory production to as few as approximately eight for high pincount complex application specific integrated circuits asics or microprocessor devices test fixtures are sold both with aehr test systems and for use with the companys installed base of systems test fixtures are also available from thirdparty suppliers the companys diepak product line includes a family of reusable temporary die carriers and associated sockets that enable the test and burnin of bare die using the same test and burnin systems used for packaged ics diepak carriers offer solutions for providing knowngood die kgd for various types of ics including memory microcontroller and microprocessor devices the diepak carrier consists of an interconnect substrate which provides an electrical connection between the die pads and the socket contacts and a mechanical support system the substrate is customized for each ic product the diepak carrier comes in several different versions designed to handle ics ranging from  pincount memory up to  pincount microprocessorsthe company competes with
