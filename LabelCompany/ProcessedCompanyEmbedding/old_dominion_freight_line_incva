by richard craver winstonsalem journal richard craver  min ago … old dominion freight line inc kept on trucking toward its first  billion revenue year in the second quarter while reporting thursday record net incomethe thomasville lessthantruckload company a top us carrier had  million in net income up  percentdiluted earnings rose  cents to the average forecast was  by nine analysts surveyed by zacks investment research analysts typically do not include onetime gains and charges in their forecastson the revenue side old dominion had an  percent jump to  millionfor the first half of fiscal  revenue is at  billion up  percent over last year it just missed  billion in fiscal the overall results are likely to encourage investors to send old dominion roaring past its week share price high of  in early trading todayold dominion’s record performance centers on gaining market share through adding and expanding centers as a lessthantruckload carrier it ships products more quickly and attracts more customers because it does not depend on a full trailer to make a profit“these were the best growth rates in revenue and earnings per share since our first quarter of ” david congdon the company’s vice chairman and chief executive said in a statementcongdon credited the revenue surge to increased demand and customers shipping heavier or larger orders“we believe that the growth in lessthantruckload tonnage was attributable to the continued improvement in the domestic economy and the consistent execution of our longterm strategic plan of delivering superior service at a fair price” congdon saidfor example he said old dominion continues to maintain an ontime delivery rate of better than  percent“with revenue growth continuing into the third quarter we intend to hire additional employees so that we can continue to deliver superior service and position ourselves to win additional market share” he saidhowever old dominion’s strong annual performances of recent years have left it susceptible to investors’ and analysts’ higher earnings expectationsfor example seeking alpha contributor stephen simpson said before the earnings report that “old dominion shares have done well on the back of a good recovery in tonnage and prices”“the growth of ecommerce and a greater focus on streamlined supply chains are creating new opportunities in lessthantruckload trucking that arguably play to old dominions strengths in information technology and service”simpson cautioned old dominion “is back to what i would call its more typical valuation situation – relatively expensive compared to its likely mediumlongterm earnings and cash flow prospects unless you are willing to give a relatively generous premium for its superior quality”“one of the more persistent bear arguments on old dominion is that the company is about as wellrun as it can be and its going to be hard for the company to continue outperforming “in fact some go as far as to argue that the service improvement efforts under way at saia and other ltls are whittling away old dominions competitive advantages and that the company is due for a stretch of underperformance as a result”stifel analyst david ross said old dominions key to recent success is that its network is better set up to benefit from additional volume due to the efficiency of its operationincremental freight comes on at very low incremental cost as opposed to other networks which might require more purchased transportation dock labor training costs etc to handle additional businessits knowing the cost of its network and using that knowledge as a tool to price freight and direct volume and density into the appropriate channels to maximize profitability ross saidold dominion had at last count  employees at its headquarters in thomasville  at a service center in greensboro and  fulltime employees overall down  from a year agoold dominion spent  million on cash dividends this fiscal year — the first in which it offered a dividend it also spent  million on share repurchases leaving  million on an authorized  million programthe company spent  million on capital investments during the quarter it now projects spending  million during fiscal   million for real estate and service center expansions  million for tractors and trailers up  million and  for information technology and other projectsold dominion said increased spending on tractors and trailers “is consistent with the company’s historical practice of reinvesting in its business to support longterm market share gains by ensuring it has the capacity to meet the service expectations of its customers” rcraverwsjournalcom rcraverwsj tags finance old dominion commerce stock exchange revenue economics forecast net income analyst david congdon

rates in revenue and earnings per share since our first quarter of  the  increase in revenue for the second quarter was driven by a  increase in ltl tonnage per day and a  increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges our ltl revenue per hundredweight increased  we believe that the growth in ltl tonnage was attributable to the continued improvement in the domestic economy and the consistent execution of our longterm strategic plan of delivering superior service at a fair price “the company’s operating ratio in the second quarter of  improved  basis points to a new company record of  this improvement was generally due to the leverage created by our accelerated revenue growth which benefited from increases in both freight density and yield as a result most of our
