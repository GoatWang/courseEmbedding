every indexs constituents are weighted by their esg score with the goal of allocating the lions share of investment dollars to good corporate citizens raising the standard with thousands of studies tying higher esg scores to better performance its hard to imagine that anybody would make investment decisions without incorporating the data but familiar benchmark indices weight their constituents using old standards — factors like capweighting or revenueweighting — strategies with no consistent correlation to lower risk or higher return owlshares imagines a future where all investors will understand the value of esg investment strategies will eventually incorporate this data by default or theyll fall behind those who discover how to harness esg now will forge new benchmarks and

help people and the planet it’s not an afterthought it’s not an alternative it’s our core strategy and we’re fiercely proud of it we believe investors don’t have to sacrifice financial returns to make a positive impact on the world every index or product we offer — or will ever offer — will aim for both sustainability and financial return owlshares believes that financial markets constitute one of the greatest mechanisms for creating positive change — not just for investors but for the world at large owlshares wants to help make that benefit and that power as widely accessible as possible and wants to see concerned investors extend their reach and impact how does owlshares benefit investors owlshares’ proprietary esg scores based on the most thorough data set available can be used to esgoptimize any investment strategy owlshares indices will allow a wide range of investors the opportunity to upgrade common portfolio asset categories to esgoptimized versions this allows investors to allocate capital to securities they already use while at the same time diverting a greater portion of the capital to better corporate citizens helping make a positive impact on society and the world what is esg esg stands for environmental social and governance usually esg refers to data about how a company manages their environmental footprint how fairly a company interacts with their social ecosystem and how well a company governs itself to protect shareholders esg can also refer to scores or ratings based on that data or to investment strategies that incorporate any of the above related five steps to become an esgenius the natural history of esg why is esg important esg data provides remarkable insight into the risks and opportunities of investing in a specific company companies that reduce their esg risks are on the whole more sustainable than their lowerscored peers more sustainable companies will generally financially outperform their peers over time the data unequivocally supports this conclusion which is why institutional investors have been consulting esg data vendors for years to analyze their investments additionally esg can help identify those companies which behave as better corporate citizens — those who minimize their environmental footprint treat employees and other stakeholders fairly and operate with honesty and transparency combining this elevated sustainability with esg’s potential to enhance performance is a powerful tool to allocate investment dollars more positively we want to improve the world now for our children and for future generations and believe esgoptimized investment products have the unique power of aligning selfinterest with helping the world the profit motive can help deploy capital for wider beneficial impact related five steps to become an esgenius the natural history of esg how does esg relate to investing one word materiality each of the literally hundreds of esg issues represents an opportunity for a company to reduce risk increase profit or both every industry has its own set of esg issues specific to the operation of that industry’s businesses esg reporting research and analysis work toward the goal of helping businesses operate better and grow for long term success related esg is not an investment strategy five steps to become an esgenius what is sri sustainable responsible and impact investing means investment strategies that consider esg factors with the goal of financial return and positive social impact when used to stand for socially responsible investing a term used less and less frequently it has often meant screening out companies or industries deemed by some to be harmful to society but we use it only in the first sense related should we divest sustainable

applied should enhance returns over the long term related how can families invest responsibly does esg have an image problem read more where do esg scores come from esg scores are primarily generated by research companies like owlshares we create proprietary esg scores that cover the majority of public companies most esg research firms employ a team of analysts that comb through sources including company filings voluntary corporate social responsibility disclosures consultants news media ngos watchdog groups and other public information sources to rate how companies are managing their esg issues these issues have been developed and proposed by standards boards public interest groups who research how industries and businesses interact with their stakeholders and the planet related the natural history of esg  five steps to become an esgenius read more why doesn’t everyone use esg data there are some challenges to using esg well though they’re clearly outweighed by the benefits      on the whole each esg research provider only rates a limited universe of companies so if you work with only one source you may not have access to data on all the companies you’re analyzing      every esg ratings provider has its own ratings methodology which is subjective on many levels      each provider chooses which industryspecific esg issues to use in forming their ratings it’s common for an under  overlap between which issues each research company deems important for each industry      each provider creates its own weighting plan for those issues rightfully they weight more important issues more heavily but this increases the ratings divergence      each provider chooses and uses esg data in different ways each analyzes and interprets it differently this is a great source of subjectivity      ratings companies looking at the same data report vastly different ratings      each esg ratings provider charges a steep fee to access the esg data and thorough investors often need to consult more than one vendor related does esg have an image problem the natural history of esg esg is not an investment strategy if esg data is inherently subjective how can i rely on any of it the challenge of using esg is mostly due to subjective selection of what esg data to use and how to apply it when analyzing whether to invest in a company these same challenges exist in other methods of fundamental investment research for instance analysts give different weight to standard metrics like pricetoearning sales growth management experience but each of these points is still valuable alone or taken as a whole like all of these metrics all esg research provides valuable insights into how a company is managing their material risks and opportunities undoubtedly more data and more analysis is better than less some data and some analysis is better than none related esg is not an investment strategy does esg have an image problem five steps to become an esgenius if esg itself is so valuable why do some esgthemed indices and funds underperform their benchmarks in certain periods simply put esg is merely data good data is a powerful tool in the investor’s toolbox but it needs to be wielded properly for good results existing esgthemed indices and funds all apply esg in different ways and heavily employ exclusionary tactics as a result those products are not an effective gauge of esg’s effect on performance companies that focus on their esg performance are generally better managed with processes and procedures that promote the longterm viability of their businesses that said esgrelated practices are only a subset of what builds value in a company there will always be shortterm reasons why companies with lower esg scores may outperform — eg the release of a new product strong marketing temporary costcutting market psychology and so on over the long term we believe consistency is a stronger strategy higherrated companies that adopt accountable and repeatable processes exhibit operational excellence related does esg have an image problem esg is not an investment strategy how can i use esg for investing most individual investors have limited options for using esg in their investment decisions high net worth individuals and institutions may pay for access to esg data hire a sustainability consultant to create a suitable portfolio or even engage the services of an index provider to create a fund for their institution or likeminded investors retail investors can choose from an increasing number of esgthemed etfs or other funds not every fund will suit every investor’s tastes read the prospectus carefully to understand how the index is determined how the methodology affects exposure and diversification and what risks that entails few esgthemed funds have achieved mainstream status many struggling against the market’s perceptions of what can be seen as a niche product but as esg gains traction and is better understood funds which include esg considerations will become more mainstream related five steps to become an esgenius what’s an etf what happens if esg standards change again could that affect index performance not if but when esg standards continue to evolve as the esg industry has developed standards organizations have focused more and more on esg issues that are material to company performance they and the esg research companies continue to perfect their craft we believe these trends will continue while there is always the chance that new standards will cause a temporary shift in relative esg scores responsible companies on the whole will continue to respond and rise to the top we believe an index based on evolving standards should likewise improve over time related  the natural history of

the prospectus and other documents the silver trust has filed with the sec for more complete information about the issuer and this offering you may get these documents for free by visiting wwwisharescom or edgar on the sec website at wwwsecgov alternatively the silver trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling tollfree  investing involves risk including possible loss of principal because shares of the trust are intended to reflect the price of the silver held by the trust the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting silver prices additionally shares of the trust are bought and sold at market price not at net asset value nav brokerage commissions will reduce returns shares of the trust are intended to reflect at any given time the market price of silver owned by the trust at that time less the trusts expenses and liabilities the price received upon the sale of shares of the trust which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the silver represented by such shares if an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares for a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of silver and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i a change in economic conditions such as a recession can adversely affect the price of silver silver is used in a wide range of industrial applications and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and consequently its price and the price of the shares ii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards silver should the speculative community take a negative view towards silver a decline in world silver prices could occur negatively impacting the price of the shares iii a significant increase in silver price hedging activity by silver producers traditionally silver producers have not hedged to the same extent as other producers of precious metals gold for example do should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of silver producing companies it could cause a decline in world silver prices adversely affecting the price of the shares silver spot prices provided by the bullion desk no warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades although shares of the trust may be bought or sold on the secondary market through any brokerage account shares are not redeemable except in large aggregated units called baskets only registered brokerdealers that become authorized participants by entering into a contract with the sponsor and the trustee of the trust may purchase or redeem baskets the amount of silver represented by shares of the trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of silver necessary to pay the sponsors fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of silver sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and investors will lose money on their investment in the shares the trust will have limited duration the liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trusts silver will result in losses to investors although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of trust shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so there is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares the value of the shares of the trust will be adversely affected if silver owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss shares of the trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by blackrock inc and its affiliates an investment in the trust is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions when comparing commodities and the trust it should be remembered that the sponsors fee associated with the trust is not borne by investors in individual commodities buying and selling shares of the trust will result in brokerage commissions because the expenses involved in an investment in physical silver will be dispersed among all holders of shares of the trust an investment in the trust may represent a costefficient alternative to investments in silver for investors not otherwise able to participate directly in the market for physical silver net asset value nav is determined as specified in the prospectus the ishares silver trusts silver and other assets are valued on the

alternative mutual funds liquid alts retail investing  oct  by andrew smith caia liquid alternative investments have exploded over the past decade post  financial crisis individual investors their advisors and institutional investors alike sought investment opportunities to provide risk diversification return enhancement and inflation hedging characteristics without sacrificing liquidity or transparency many investors both professional and individual believe that liquid alternatives are a new commodity however they have been around for quite some time it is true that the explosive growth in alternative mutual and exchange traded funds has largely taken place over the past halfdecade or so but the liquid alternative market as a whole is much broader than simply alternative mutual and exchange traded funds liquid alternatives by definition are any investment funds that are tradable on a daily or intraday basis that provide investors’ exposure to assets that fall outside the traditional “box” of stocks bonds  cash when past generations wanted to make investments they had very few options publicly listed stocks or bonds bank products such as cds cash like investments such as money market funds and private investment opportunities the final being high risk typically carrying no liquidity no transparency and the need for expertise in the sector over the past  decades there have been vast strides made to bring alternative investments such as real estate commodities active investment funds private equity funds and nontraditional real estate holdings such as oil  gas properties farmland timberland etc to the mainstream public in a liquid regulated transparent package while the investment company act of  has long allowed for the creation operation marketing and thus investment in mutual funds that provide alternative asset exposure the first liquid alternative funds to gain traction were publicly listed real estate investment trusts or reits reits began being offered at the end of the s however they were widely unknown investment opportunities in  there were only  reits in total carrying assets under management as measured by market capitalization of  billion since the s the reit market has grown fold in aum to over  billion in total aum and fold in number of reits offered to  in  according to nareit other real estate opportunities have gained popularity as well such as timberland investment management organizations timos though not nearly the popularity of reits below are two charts first showing the growth in the number of listed reits followed by one showing growth in aum of reits listed reits offer investors exposure to the vast global real estate market with intraday tradability listed reits also offer investors who seek real estate exposure professional asset management the demand for liquid real estate exposure was and remains elevated particularly after the lack of liquidity and lumpiness of private real estate ownership burned a large number of real estate investors in the  financial crises as mentioned earlier other investment opportunities in real estate or real assets for a broader definition have long existed only recently to garner popularity in a liquid transparent regulated and accessible package oil and gas opportunities have always intrigued investors as the demand globally for energy commodities have and will continue to increase as the world develops dependency on fossil fuels creates an opportunity to generate healthy returns with inflation hedging characteristics publicly listed master limited partnerships mlps have made these opportunities accessible to all investors the listed mlp market has exploded over the past  decades and particularly since the financial crisis of  in  there were only  listed mlps with a total aum measured by market capitalization of billion at the beginning of  that market had grown to over  mlps with over  billion in aum since  aum in mlps which bottomed at billion has grown more than fold and the number of funds has increased by over  from  at the end of  to current levels there are a number of reasons for the explosive growth in this market however the two most compelling are the inflation hedging benefits and the taxadvantaged status of the mlp vehicle listed mlps are one of the best inflation hedges providing investors both an infrastructure and commodity exposure listed mlps distribute a lot of cash as a mandate of their existence providing investors a stable income investment opportunity but they also carry significant tax advantages and with the majority of current us investors entering or getting close to their retirement tax advantaged income is in high demand factors such as diversification liquidity and transparency in a market that previously had little opportunity to diversify due to very few funds with high minimum investments no liquidity and a significant lack of transparency add to the appeal of listed mlps and have drawn individual investors investment advisors and institutional investors to increase their allocations to listed mlps the charts above highlight this demand in a visual format   liquid alternative investment opportunities are not confined to the real estatereal asset sectors the private equity market a traditionally highly complex and nontransparent asset class with virtually no liquidity has begun its shift into the liquid alternative space with the listing increased awareness towards and growing popularity of business development companies bdcs listed bdcs are the first publicly listed private equity funds accessible by individual and institutional investors alike while not all bdcs are listed many more are choosing a public stock exchange as an outlet to not only raise capital and garner a public valuation but offer investors liquidity and transparency bdcs are not as broad of a private equity exposure as many investors would like focusing mostly on middle market growth companies that are preparing for strategic sale of public offering however it is an exposure to private equity particularly for those investors that have been shunned from the market due to high minimum investments and investor qualification rules the listed bdc market is young and still growing but just since  the number of listed bdcs has nearly doubled and the assets under management in the listed bdcs has nearly tripled bdcs are the liquid alternative to private structure private equity funds and are a liquid alternative investment offering liquid exposure to private equity through public stock exchanges below are two charts the first shows the growth in the number of listed bdcs in  and again in  the second highlights the growth in listed bdc assets under management as can clearly be seen the number of the popularity of and the awareness towards listed bdcs as a liquid private equity fund has grown significantly and likely will continue to as institutional investors intend to increase their private equity allocations to nearly double their current level by  according to preqin liquid alternatives serve a useful purpose in both the individual and institutional portfolio as discussed in this posting real estate real assets  private equity has become significantly more accessible with the listing of reits mlps and bdcs however most noninstitutional investors have also suffered from a lack of exposure to actively managed alternative investment funds that employ sophisticated trading strategies developed and operated by “wall street” professionals with significant knowledge these funds commonly known as hedge funds have always lacked accessibility carried high minimum investments complex fee structures and only provided liquidity when the manager of said funds was willing both pre  post financial crisis investors in hedge funds sought better alternatives the alternative mutual and exchange traded fund business exploded alternative mutual  exchange traded funds offer investors exposure in actively managed longshort commodity equities  fixed income strategies domestically region specific andor globally there is a broad range of various strategies whether simply value oriented and actively managed or focused on a specific situation such as merger arbitrage or some other specialty in  there was only billion in aum in alternative mutual funds  etfs by  it had grown  fold at the end of  total aum in alternative mutual funds  etfs reached over billion this chart demonstrates the enormous growth in popularity of these liquid alternative funds as has been detailed throughout this post investors today have the ability to build a truly diversified portfolio gaining exposure to asset classes such as real estate real assets oil  gas land timberland commodities infrastructure private equity  hedge funds without sacrificing the liquidity of their portfolio capital markets today are far more competitive than they were when our parents and grandparents were building their wealth through investing for generations the only investment options were stocks bonds bank products cashlike investments such as money market funds and private investment deals this presented a massive challenge to the average investors attempting to build a diversified longterm portfolio particularly maintaining a high level of liquidity today there is no excuse whether you’re an individual investor retail advisor or institutional investor for maintaining a portfolio that lacks asset or strategy diversification there are many options that provide investors the ability to expose their portfolio to a broad spectrum of both traditional and alternative assets as well as traditional and alternative strategies here in the new millennium capital markets have evolved and the inclusion of liquid alternative strategies allow investors of all size and sophistication to take a longterm diversified asset allocation approach building a stable portfolio focused on delivering returns minimizing risk and meeting the goals of the portfolio the evolution of the liquid alternatives market has been significant beginning in the late s investors have seen the continuous addition of new opportunities that provide new asset and strategy exposure and have for the most part taken advantage of such opportunities investors that have not yet participated in these new opportunities have not missed out it is not too late for investors of all sizes to take advantage of liquid alternatives it would be prudent of all investors to seek advice from a professional or conduct adequate research to determine the best way to include liquid alternative opportunities in their portfolio the growth in this market is expected to continue and new products seemingly emerge every month while traditional investments still serve their purpose within the portfolio it will become increasingly important as markets become increasingly efficient from an information standpoint to utilize alternatives if seeking to outperform or stabilize returns when investing liquid alternatives will likely become the preferred option for all investors as they have already for so many it is likely that liquid alternatives will replace the private structure funds of old if not entirely significantly due to the increase in transparency and the ability to redeem funds quickly and easily as needed andrew n smith caia is a cofounder and chief product strategist for owlshares and serves as the chairperson of the
