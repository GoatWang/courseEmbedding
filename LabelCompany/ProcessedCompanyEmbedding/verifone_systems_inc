merchant’s primer october   marked a major milestone in the us payments landscape when liability for fraudulent counterfeit credit and debit card transactions shifted from issuers to merchants unless those merchants migrate to pos technology that accommodates the emv europaymastercardvisa standard in this primer we take a look at what emv is what the liability shift is meant to accomplish how migration will benefit merchants and what consequences merchants should expect from failure to embrace emvcompliant technology we also dispel some of the myths surrounding emv implementation lay out the basic groundwork for emv migration and explore other technologies that should be implemented in conjunction with emv as part of a comprehensive data security solution who what where  why emv is an openstandard set of specifications for chip card payments and acceptance devices developed to define requirements that ensure interoperability between pos terminals and chipbased payment cards chipbased payment cards contain embedded microprocessors that provide strong transaction security features and other application capabilities not possible with traditional magstripe cards there are three types • contact contact chip cards communicate with the card reader over a contact “plate” that must touch the terminal such contact is usually established by inserting the card into a slot in the terminal or atm • contactless contactless cards communicate via radio frequency rf technology as such they contain an antenna • dualinterface dualinterface chip cards combine contact and contactless card technologies they communicate with the card by touching its plate or in rf mode as for emv specifications these are managed maintained and enhanced by emvco which executes testing and other processes related to emv such processes include but are not limited to card and terminal evaluation security evaluation and the handling of interoperability issues emvco’s work is overseen by six member organizations american express discover jcb mastercard unionpay and visa other payments industry stakeholders—including banks merchants processors and technology vendors—participate in emvco initiatives as technical and business associates emvco is not responsible for individual card brand certifications emv benefits decreases card fraud an emvenabled card’s microprocessor chip stores information securely and carries security credentials that are encoded by the card issuer when the card is personalized for an individual cardholder using userspecific keys the encoding of these credentials helps prevent fraudsters from creating counterfeit cards “cloning” unlike magstripe cards which are easy to duplicate because they lack the security features of microprocessor chips emv cards emv handbook one year later cannot be duplicated or used to complete fraudulent transactions in order to be successfully processed emv transactions require an authentic card validated either online by the issuer using a dynamic cryptogram or offline with the terminal using static data authentication sda dynamic data authentication dda or combined dda with application cryptogram generation cda emv transactions also create unique transaction data so that any captured data cannot be used to execute new transactions additionally emv reduces fraud resulting from card theft and loss by harnessing enhanced transaction authorization card authentication and cardholder verification • transaction authorization uses issuerdefined rules to authorize transactions either online or offline for an online authorization emv transactions proceed in the same manner as with magstripe cards transaction information and a transactionspecific cryptogram are sent to the issuer which authorizes or declines the transaction offline the card and terminal communicate and use issuerdefined risk parameters to determine whether the transaction can be authorized offline transactions are typical in situations where terminals do not have internet connectivity or in countries where telecommunication costs are high • card authentication occurs online via cryptographic processing which validates the integrity of the card number and certain static and dynamic live data used in the transaction or offline through sda dda or a combination of dda with cda dynamic data is unique to each transaction so it can’t be used more than once even if fraudsters manage to steal it any attempt to do so would cause that transaction to be declined • cardholder verification ensures that the person attempting to make the transaction is the person to whom the card belongs it is executed through one of four cardholder verification methods cvms supported by emv offline chip and pin online chip and pin chip and signature and no cvm contactless the choice of cvm depends on the merchant acquirer and issuer alike allows interoperability with the global payments infrastructure consumers with emvenabled cards can use them on any emvcompatible payment terminal in the world such interoperability is likely to become increasingly important as some nations consider phasing out magstripe cards entirely additional emv benefits meanwhile although merchants aren’t required to follow an emv migration path significant benefits await those that do by deploying emvcompliant hardware and software they can avoid major financial repercussions this is the strongest argument for embracing emv maintaining nonemvcompliant pos technology leaves merchants responsible for potentially steep costs stemming from fraudulent transactions and chargebacks as of emv handbook one year later october  mastercard will exempt merchants from  of account data compromise penalties if at least  of mastercard transactions that originate in their stores are handled on emvcompliant pos terminals pci audit relief if more than  of merchant visa and mastercard transactions since october   originate from emvcompliant pos terminals that support both contact and contactless transactions the merchant may apply for relief from the audit requirement for pci compliance but is still required to be pcicompliant build a futureproof payment acceptance infrastructure that supports new payment innovations and technologies nfcenabled nearfield communications mobile devices that are used to accept mobile contactless payments as well as other mobile applications like mobile couponing and loyalty programs top the list of these options emvco has been playing a key role in defining the architecture specifications requirements and type approval processes for supporting emv mobile contactless payments this helped to facilitate the launch of nfc mobile contactless payments in europe where an emvbased payments infrastructure is already in place the same is likely to happen in the us take advantage of global interoperability to boost business many us merchants want to attract to their establishments to visitors from countries where chip cards are the norm acquiring emvcompliant hardware and software prevents merchants from losing business of foreign customers who favor the security afforded by chip cards and are reluctant or unwilling to revert to the use of the magstripe on their cards to process payments as of october  card brands will hold “the party that is the cause of a chip card transaction not occurring” ie a merchant whose terminals are not emvcompliant liable for any resulting cardpresent counterfeit fraud losses review card brand specifics by visiting their websites

a number of upgrades from earlier models such as full color display arm  processors and a fully programmable pin pad key trends and forcesedit summary of trendsedit the industry’s growth continues to be driven by the longterm shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of similar products have caused price reductions reduced margins and a loss of market share for

addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of

vx evolution line is an extension of verifones countertop and pin pad products and included a number of upgrades from earlier models such as full color display arm  processors and a fully programmable pin pad key trends and forcesedit summary of trendsedit the industry’s growth continues to be driven by the longterm shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of

pin pad key trends and forcesedit summary of trendsedit the industry’s growth continues to be driven by the longterm shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of

pin pad key trends and forcesedit summary of trendsedit the industry’s growth continues to be driven by the longterm shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of

vx evolution line is an extension of verifones countertop and pin pad products and included a number of upgrades from earlier models such as full color display arm  processors and a fully programmable pin pad key trends and forcesedit summary of trendsedit the industry’s growth continues to be driven by the longterm shift towards electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks in addition to an improvement in security standards that require more advanced electronic payment systems international and national security issues have become the main drivers of verifones business model as customers seek means to meet everescalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations these trends have been accelerated by the usage of credit and debit card based payments especially pinbased debit another key driver is the growth in single application credit card products that enable merchants to provide payment solutions in nontraditional settings such as payatthetable in restaurants exposure to and rapid penetration of electronic payments in emerging marketsedit rapid economic growth and subsequent infrastructure development—expanding presence of ip and wireless communication networks in eastern europe latin america and east asia have led to significant increases in demand for verifones electronic payment products verifone has strategically gained exposure to these growing markets and its  revenue breakdown is a good indication of this in particular during the fiscal year ended october    of verifones net revenues were generated outside of the united states verifone expects the percentage of net revenues generated outside of the united states to continue to increase in the coming years the firms system solutions segments net revenues increased  million or  during the fiscal year ended october   as compared to the fiscal year ended october   primarily due to a  million increase in international system solutions net revenues this increase was offset by a decline in north america system solutions revenue of  million the increase in international system solutions net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the latin american market primarily brazil as several of verifones largest brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products as well as higher demand for prepaid topups medical and health care system solutions furthermore european net revenues for system solutions increased by  million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in russia and ukraine the decrease in north america system solutions net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firms petroleum solutions and a reduction in demand from united states financial businesses verifones increased revenue from abroad has not increased its profit margins on the contrary international gross profit percentage declined due to the combination of increased price competition in emerging markets countries including russia china turkey and brazil in addition certain customers purchased nonpci compliant inventory at significant discounts in addition revenues in latin america which have historically carried gross margins below international averages increased proportionally in the fiscal year ended october   as international sales of verifones system solutions products have tended to carry lower average selling prices and therefore have lower gross margins than its sales in north america increasing ip connectivityedit large telecommunication carriers have expanded their communication networks and lowered fees which lets merchants use ipbased networks more cost effectively this increased ip connectivity has led to faster processing speeds and lower costs which in turn has opened new markets for electronic payment systems including many that have been primarily cashonly industries such as quick service restaurants “qsrs” additional wireless electronic payment solutions are being developed to increase transaction processing speed and mobility at the point of sale and offer significant security benefits that enabling consumers to avoid relinquishing their payment cards for example a portable device can be presented to consumers to payatthetable in fullservice restaurants or to pay in other environments such as outdoor arenas pizza delivery farmers’ markets and taxi cabs the increase in ip connectivity in several fastgrowing emerging economies in particular brazil turkey china brazil and israel has fueled much of the  million increase in verifones international system solutions net revenues for  however the pervasive global bear market in  has negated any positive impact on verifones revenues from increasing ip connectivity in all market sectors as well as domestic and international markets growth of wireless communicationsedit the development and increased use of wireless communication infrastructures are increasing demand for compact easytouse and reliable wireless payment solutions the wireless communications industry has grown substantially in the united states and globally over the past twenty years the increased speed of wireless communications and everexpanding coverage maps of standardized wireless data technologies such as general packet radio service “gprs” and code division multiple access “cdma” makes wireless telecommunications an attractive alternative to traditional telecommunications the  million increase in revenue from north american system solutions products was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for wireless products due to customers’ interest in differentiating the service they provide to merchants and higher sales in canada where merchants are preparing for a transition to a new payment card technology offered by interac increased focus on security issuesedit industry security standards are constantly evolving driving recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems particularly in europe and the united states in order to offer electronic payment systems that connect to payment networks electronic payment system providers certify their products and services with card associations financial institutions and payment processors and comply with government and telecommunications company regulations not surprisingly security has become a driving factor in its business as customers endeavor to meet ever escalating governmental requirements related to the prevention of identity theft as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations members of which include visa mastercard american express discover financial services and jcb in response to increasing industry demands for high security products in the fiscal year ended october   verifone incurred an obsolescence charge of  million primarily due to the implementation of new pci security standards competitionedit verifone is one of the top three providers of electronic payment systems and services in the world the markets for this companys products are highly competitive and have been subject to price pressures in the last two years competition from manufacturers distributors and providers of similar products have caused price reductions reduced margins and a loss of market share for example one of verifones former customersfirst data corporation has developed its own series of proprietary
