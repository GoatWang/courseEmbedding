year and our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year  before we open up the call for qa with that let me turn the call over to antonio antonio antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director thanks karl and thanks to everyone for joining us today we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter that reflected a strong execution by the aspentech team in a macro environment that remains challenging looking at our financial highlights for the quarter total revenue was  million at the high end of our guidance range of  million to  million gaap operating income was  million and nongaap operating income was  million which represents a nongaap operating margin of  gaap earnings per share was  and nongaap earnings per share was  both of which were  above the highend of our guidance ranges free cash flow was  million and we returned  million to shareholders by repurchasing  million shares for the full fiscal year  we delivered total revenue of  million gaap earnings per share of  and nongaap earnings per share of  both of which were above the high end of our guidance ranges gaap operating margin of  and nongaap operating margin of  up  basis points yearoveryear free cash flow of  million annual spend of  million up  yearoveryear and we returned  million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately  million shares were pleased with our fourth quarter performance which enabled us to achieve the upper end of our  to  annual spend guidance for the full year during the quarter we saw broadbased demand from downstream and chemicals customers who continued to make investments to improve the efficiency and productivity of their assets we were encouraged that the deal flow and customer dynamics around completing transactions in the quarter more closely represented historical patterns reflecting the value customers realize from our solutions however we have yet to see customers believe that oil prices have stabilized which would continue to weigh on overall demand during our q earnings call we referred to some sizeable transactions in our q pipeline were pleased to have closed significant transactions in the fourth quarter with two of the largest oil and chemical companies in the world these transactions expand aspentechs footprint across these customers assets portfolio and demonstrate the positive impact of our business from the rd investments made in recent years across our product suite in particular in the pimsao advanced optimization planning product the dmc adopted advanced controlled product and in the aspenone process explorer client data visualization product as well as in our engineering products we believe these two transactions are a testament to the value we deliver to customers and our ability to grow our business in a challenging economic environment our fourth quarter performance was achieved despite the fact that the three latin american noc transactions referenced on prior earnings calls did not renew the macro environment in certain countries in this region remains challenging and while we continue actively engage with these customers the timing for any of these transactions to close is unclear at this time we do not intend to provide further progress updates on these transactions going forward but we will inform investors if any of these transactions closes turning to engineering and construction and upstream energy this vertical markets continue to be under pressure though we did experience a second quarter of positive growth for the smb ec group the rebound in oil prices during the second calendar quarter was a positive development though we have yet to see price stability in the oil market as weve consistently said we believe price stability in a comfortable range for producers is a necessary step before customers in this vertical will have the confidence to step up investment in their businesses looking at our performance in q we saw a solid performance in our north america middle east russia and global accounts regions these regions were also the primary growth drivers for the full year from a product perspective for the year our engineering business represented  of our overall annual spend growth with the msc business representing the other  we were pleased with the performance of our engineering business considering that its growth was impacted by the macro environment impacting the ec and upstream verticals our install base of business at the end of the year on annual spend basis is split  engineering and  msc our three core verticals of energy chemicals and ec contributed   and  of our growth in annual spend during the year respectively our attrition rate for fiscal year  was around  which compares to approximately  in fiscal year  the attrition rate is a new metric that we introduced to investors during our investor day in early june to measure the retention rates for our contracts on a dollar basis against our total base of annual spend this is consistent with the number we shared at analyst day and reflects the impact from the challenges facing our ec and upstream customers it is our current intention to update investors on this metric on a yearly basis karl will review our overall guidance later but i wanted to take a moment to discuss our annual spend outlook for fiscal year  were reiterating our target of  to  growth in annual spend this outlook assumes no impact from the latin american noc transactions that has not renewed and no improvement in the demand environment we experienced in fiscal year  as you know annual spend growth can fluctuate quartertoquarter based on the timing of customer contracts and renewals but overall we feel confident about our ability to deliver another year of growth in fiscal year  turning to the fourth quarter energy engineering and construction and chemicals once again represented greater than  of our business energy was the largest vertical contributor followed by chemicals ec was a negative contributor to growth in the fourth quarter looking at our  largest transactions in the quarter there was again a mix of engineering and manufacturing supply chain transactions i would like to provide some color on this quarter by highlighting the following transactions first a global oil company signed a sizeable transaction with aspentech to extend its use of our petroleum supply chain solutions after piloting our pimsao solution and determining the significant incremental margin expansion potential from its use in their operations second a global producer of industrial gases decided to expand use of our aspen capital cost estimation product in its north american operations after evaluating acce against a competing product this decision not only quadrupled this customers token entitlement but also opened up usage of the aspenone engineering suite in particular this customer sees an opportunity to realize significant value from the pressure relief valve sizing and flare analyzer functionalities in aspen plus which further validates the benefits from the breadth of functionality available in this suite third a longterm customer a global chemicals company renewed its engineering and msc agreement while increasing entitlement and annual spend the renewal will lead to increased deployment of aspentechs supply chain management solution across many of their plants to improve operations through the use of our scheduling solution finally a large russian refiner expanded use of aspentech msc solutions by implementing our aspen petroleum scheduler solution in their scheduling organizations at their refineries that we were able to grow token entitlement with this customer despite the difficult macro environment in russia reflects the incremental value a customer expects to realize by leveraging the synergies between our scheduling and engineering solutions at our recent analyst day we outlined our future product vision that will be built around asset optimization we have a comprehensive product roadmap that we believe will significantly enhance our leadership in asset design and asset operations as well as expand our market presence to include asset maintenance a key element of our strategy is to leverage the large amounts of operational data and asset models in the aspenone platform with a purposebuilt analytics solution during the quarter we announced the general availability of aspenone version  including exciting early analytics capabilities for column analysis inside hysys and aspen plus which will help drive energy savings of up to  for distillation columns other innovations in version  include the integration of the blowdown depressurization solution and sulsim sulfur recovery technology that we previously acquired we have seen strong customer interest in this acquired safety and environmental technologies which highlight the value of our tuckin ma strategy can produce the version  release has been received in the marketplace with positive customer feedback and strong interest and demand we will continue to use ma to augment our internal product development efforts during the quarter we made another tuckin acquisition of the fidelis group a leading provider of asset reliability software used to help owneroperators predict and optimize asset performance as part of their risk analysis process fidelis solutions are a great addition to the aspenone platform and will help accelerate execution of our asset optimization strategy aspentechs highly scalable business model generates significant free cash flow which we can deploy to support ma and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases during the fourth quarter we repurchased another  million of stock bringing our cumulative share repurchases to over  million since fiscal year  as we announced last call it is our intention to repurchase  million of stock in fiscal year  based on current market conditions and business outlook our strong balance sheet and free cash flow are a strategic asset for the company and we intend to continue to deploy capital prudently to support our growth initiatives and share repurchase program to produce significant shareholder value before i close i would like to welcome the newest member of our board of directors halsey wise halsey has nearly  years of technology and leadership experience most recently as the chairman and ceo of medassets a healthcare technology company he also has a strong engineering software background from his time as chairman president and ceo of intergraph a leading engineering and geospatial software company halseys extensive operational and financial experience will be a strong addition to our board and i look forward to his contribution to summarize aspentech ended fiscal  on a strong note our ability to generate over  growth in annual spend in a year that has seen significant disruption in several of our key markets underscores the resiliency of our business and a significant value we generate for customers were executing well in a challenging environment and believe were wellpositioned to deliver another year of growth and profitability in fiscal year  with that let me turn the call over to karl karl karl e johnsen  senior vice president  chief financial officer thanks antonio i will now review our financial results for fourth quarter and full fiscal year  beginning with annual spend annual spend which is a proxy for the annualized value of our recurrent term license and maintenance business at the end of each period was approximately  million at the end of the fourth quarter this represented an increase of approximately  on a yearoveryear basis and  sequentially now let me turn our financial results beginning on a gaap basis total revenue was  million for the fourth quarter and compares to  million in the prior year period looking at revenue by line item subscription software revenue was  million for the fourth quarter an increase from  million in the prior year period and down from  million last quarter services and other revenue was  million compared to  million in the year ago period and  million last quarter as a reminder we recognized approximately  million of nonrecurring revenue during the third quarter and did not have any similar revenue during the fourth quarter turning to profitability gross profit was  million in the quarter with a gross margin of  which compares to  million and a gross margin of  in the prior year period operating expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the year ago period total gaap expenses including cost of revenue are  million which is down from  million in the year ago period and down from  million last quarter for the full year total expenses were  million which was slightly below our guidance range of  million to  million striking the appropriate balance between making targeted investments for growth and maintaining strong expense management has been and will remain a core focus of our management team operating income was  million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to  million in the year ago period net income for the quarter was  million or  per share compared to net income of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter fiscal  turning to nongaap results excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense restructuring charges amortization of intangibles associated with acquisition acquisitionrelated expenses and noncapitalized acquired technology we reported nongaap operating income for the fourth quarter of  million representing a  nongaap operating margin compared to nongaap operating income and margin of  million and  respectively in the year ago period nongaap net income was  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on  million shares outstanding which was  above the high end of our guidance range this compares to nongaap net income of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on  million shares outstanding for the full fiscal year our revenue was  million and was in line with our guidance range gaap operating income of  million was an improvement from  million in fiscal  while nongaap operating income of  million improved from  million in fiscal  turning to the balance sheet and cash flow the company ended the year with  million in cash and marketable securities compared to  million from last quarter the increase reflects the return of approximately  million of net cash that has been held in escrow related to our kbc bid during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately  million shares of our stock for  million bringing us to a total of  million in buybacks for fiscal  looking at our deferred revenue balance it was  million at the end of the fourth quarter representing a  decrease compared to the end of the year ago period on a sequential basis deferred revenue increased  million the yearoveryear decline reflects the continued impact of approximately  million in nonrecurring revenue recognized over the past year that had been included in deferred revenue combined with lower levels of deferred services revenue from a cash flow perspective the company generated  million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and  million for the full fiscal year for the full fiscal year  free cash flow was  million this years free cash flow is down from the  million generated in fiscal  due to the fact that we became a us corporate taxpayer at the beginning of fiscal year  adjusting for the approximately  million in cash taxes paid during the year free cash flow grew approximately  a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap results is provided in the tables within our press release which is also available on our website id now like to close with our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal  we are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance that we initially provided at our investor day this past june we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million and continue to expect subscription software to comprise greater than  of revenue with our services and other revenue representing the remainder from an expense perspective we expect total gaap expenses of  million to  million taken together we continue to target gaap operating income in the range of  million to  million for fiscal  with gaap net income of approximately  million to  million we expect gaap net income per share of  to  from a nongaap perspective we are reiterating our nongaap operating income guidance of  million to  million and expect nongaap income per share in the range of  to  the increase in our gaap and nongaap income per share guidance reflects the impact of our share repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with respect to annual spend growth in fiscal  as antonio has already indicated we are maintaining our guidance of  to  annual spend growth in fiscal  from a free cash flow perspective we are reiterating our fiscal year guidance of  million to  million that was initially provided at our investor day our fiscal  free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately  million to  million from a timing perspective we would expect to pay  of our cash taxes in the second quarter with remaining  paid equally in the third and fourth quarters as it relates to the first quarter we expect revenue in the range of  million to  million nongaap operating income of  million to  million and nongaap eps of  to  per share on a gaap basis we expect operating income of  million to  million and income per share of  to  in summary were pleased with our fourth quarter performance we are executing well in a challenging market which together with our strong expense discipline is generating solid profitability and cash flow with that were now happy to take your questions operator lets begin the qa questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from matt pfau with william blair matthew c pfau  william blair  co llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions first one want to digin a little bit on the large deal that you closed in the quarter that i assume drove some of the upside there with the annual spend number so was this just that you had closed the deals for more than you had originally expected or factored in the guidance or i guess what drove the upside because given youre maintaining your guidance for fiscal  for annual spend it doesnt seem like they were pulled forward or anything antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director no i mean look when we had our q earnings call we talked about some sizable transactions in our q pipeline weve been working on these deals and we knew there was a good probability that it would close in the q quarter and we managed to do so its more than one but in general as i said in my commentary we also saw a broadbased demand for our products with our owneroperators in refining and chemicals so it wasnt just one transaction there was more than one sizable transaction but there was also a good solid demand for our products in the quarter matthew c pfau  william blair  co llc got it and then with respect to the fiscal  annual spend guidance you commented that theres not an expectation of closing some of the national – those two latin american or three latin american oil company contracts during fiscal  was this the expectation all along or is this different in respect to what youve factored into your expectations for the annual spend for fiscal  antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director well the annual spend guidance for fiscal  what it says and i stated is that those latin american noc deals are not included in the  to  so that doesnt mean that we dont expect them to close but based on the dynamics that we saw over the last three quarters we feel it is a safe or conservative thing to do not to bake them into the guidance well continue to engage with those customers and well see if they close in fiscal  matthew c pfau  william blair  co llc all right great thats it from me guys thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from monika garg with pacific crest monika garg  pacific crest securities hi thanks for taking my question first the annual spend guidance of  to  maybe can you talk about how do you think the growth is between ec chemicals and energy industries baked into the guidance antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director well monika the basic assumption that weve made about fiscal  is that it will look a lot like  we dont believe based on where we are today and what weve seen that the dynamics have changed in the marketplace so we told you that almost   of our growth came from really energy and chemicals and thats really refining chemicals a little bit from ec and some other from other industries the rest about  to  so we would expect the same dynamic for  monika garg  pacific crest securities got it thanks then your nongaap margins came in at  points in fiscal  but youre guiding to  to  for  so why so much margin compression or are you being conservative karl e johnsen  senior vice president  chief financial officer so monika its karl i think when you look at  you have to factor in the onetime revenues that weve talked about about  million which brought them up so you could kind of factor those in and then we are making a investment in  but we are expanding our expenses that we talked about on investor day so were making some targeted investments into the marketing with digital platforms rd and a little bit of the back office monika garg  pacific crest securities then antonio oil has recovered from the somewhat low prices we had seen could you maybe talk about you have seen any changes in tone with your customers or how the customers are viewing the market antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director well i mean look i think overall including customers it was nice to see oil move up to  to  and stay there even north of  for a while but as youve also seen in the last few weeks oil got down to  and now its been back up a little bit to  or so when we talk to customers they feel that – theyre just waiting to see what the bottom is really for oil as ive met with investors and also you monika and other analysts what ive said is that we need to see oil prices stabilized at a level that creates confidence in our customers for them to then plan to invest when their next budget cycle comes around in september october november for calendar year  but when you have oil prices still moving up and then down and up again it sort of gives a sense that things are not yet fully stable as far as the supplydemand equation but theres a positive outlook if you read the analysts commentary looks like oil is already coming into balance and probably the supply will be outstripping demand towards the end of the calendar year and that should be positive but at the moment i dont think theres enough there for customers or us to change how we feel about the current market monika garg  pacific crest securities thank you so much antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from sterling auty with jpmorgan jackson e ader  jpmorgan securities llc hi guys this is jackson ader on for sterling antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director hi jackson jackson e ader  jpmorgan securities llc hi how are you you called out that north america and middle east and russia were all positive regions in the quarter i was just wondering if we can get an update maybe on europe antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah no look europe – central europe has a big chemicals industry and as such we saw good demand on chemicals out of europe at the same time the ec company space in europe faced the same dynamics that everyone else did in the ec space the refining business in europe has always been more challenged from a margins perspective than the rest of the world because of the dynamics there with really a contracting refining base nonetheless we saw good demand out of europe but the combination of upstream ecs they make europe the standout that these are the regions that we called out were jackson e ader  jpmorgan securities llc okay great and then just a quick followup as you look out into  are there any large renewals and i know youve talked about not anything past that are going to slip but are there new large renewals that are coming up in  and if so what quarters do you expect them to come up for renewal antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yes well i mean look as you would expect every year we have a whole new set of renewals that come up because – since its a sixyear contract and they are distributed over those six years we do have renewals some of size and most of not great size but the thing about the last  months is that weve also learned a lot about the dynamics in the market we believe we understand better how customers are thinking about their businesses both in chemicals refining ecs and upstream and going into  i also feel that were better prepared to work with customers on these renewals but theres nothing there that we would call out like we have done for the latin american nocs jackson e ader  jpmorgan securities llc okay great that was all for me thank you antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator the next question comes from mark schappel with benchmark mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc hi good evening thank you for taking my question here antonio with respect to the two large transactions with the large oil and chemical customers in the quarter were those deals with the nocs or were they with the independents antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director no independents mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc independents and then building on a prior question in fiscal  i believe the company had a higher than usual concentration of contract renewals – up for renewal with the national oil companies and i was just wondering if you can give us an idea of what fiscal  looks like just generally with respect to the noc contract renewals is it above average is it below average average antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director no but let me look – yeah theres a lot of nocs out there the thing about  is there was a concentration of nocs in a specific part of the world that we called out and we also felt that the other two contracts we needed to call them out but the profile of our noc business understanding what it takes to renew business with different nocs because not all nocs are equal its not the same  looks different than  and thats why we havent called out anything specific to our renewals in  mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc okay thank you antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah operator your next question comes from michael morosi with avondale partners antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director hey michael michael morosi  avondale partners llc hi guys thanks for taking the questions antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah michael morosi  avondale partners llc first off youre obviously seeing a lot of strength in the downstream segments your owneroperators in the chemicals could you talk just a little bit more about the sources of that is that some of the products that you brought into that market is it macro is it some of the other things youre doing to educate customers just so we can understand those drivers a little better antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah well let me look i stated in my commentary that certainly i believe that the investments that we have made in our products over the last few years and really five years or so is starting to pay off weve enhanced the capabilities the optimization algorithms not to get too technical here weve replatformed some products and done a lot to them and introduced new completely new products such as adaptive process control and i think thats all paying off dmc and adaptive process control its in its third year but now its getting more traction in the market weve done certain things to pimsao that have improved our product and create much greater value for our customers than pims does and theres a series of pims in addition even though the environment for refiners and chemical producers have been positive i still think that theres always that pressure to continue to optimize and drive efficiencies out of their assets and thats what you see in what these customers are doing look were also getting better i like to think that some of our focus on digital marketing and how were reaching out to customers and the messaging around our value propositions is having an impact so when you see something like this its a combination of multiple factors including a testament to the leadership of the company in the marketplace and our relationship with customers so it takes a lot of factors but its a good outcome and were very happy about it michael morosi  avondale partners llc thats great thanks a lot for that and then with respect to the annual spend we appreciate the color on growth by segment but how about by region are there particular pockets of strength that youre seeing antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah so when i mentioned north america russia the middle east global accounts those are regions that showed strength in growth and better than expected in some cases in others they delivered growth that was commensurate with what we would expect in a normal environment out of those regions so some of those regions exceeded our expectations and others just delivered to what they should deliver on a normal environment so you should take those four regions as regions that showed a solid growth michael morosi  avondale partners llc and then finally its good to hear that we saw sequential improvement again in the smb portion of the ec market but youre still pretty cautious overall on that segment how do you kind of square those two developments and when do you think that strength in the kind of the more volatile end of the market will flow through to the broader market antonio j pietri  president chief executive officer  director yeah look if you look at the metrics that we released you will conclude that our ec business was actually positive for the year when we had stated and felt that it was going to be slightly negative a couple of quarters ago i think part of it is a turnaround that weve seen in the smb business in q and q i like to wait until i see the spending patterns in calendar

will be as follows antonio will discuss business highlights from the quarter and then ill review our financial results for the third quarter and our guidance for the fourth quarter as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year  before we open the call up for qa antonio antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc thanks karl and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon we delivered a solid third quarter financial performance with revenue and profitability that exceeded our guidance looking at our financial results for the quarter annual spend was  million up  yearoveryear total revenue of  million was above the high end of our guidance range gaap operating income was  million and nongaap operating income was  million which represents a nongaap operating margin of  gaap eps was  and nongaap eps was  both of which exceeded the highend of our guidance ranges free cash flow was  million and we repurchased  million shares for  million were pleased with our financial performance considering that the spending environment remains challenging due to the market dynamics we have experienced over the past two years engineering and construction and upstream customers are focused on being profitable in a  to  per barrel oil environment that they expect to continue for the foreseeable future they remain closely focused on cost controls and reducing their operating expenses after rightsizing their businesses to match the engineering personnel head count to the lower capex spend which is about  lower than its peak in  according to published reports in addition the latin america business environment with a major stateowned enterprises continues to be a net negative as the region on oil sector continued to struggle to recover from their macro environment and operational challenges positively our owneroperator customers in the chemicals and downstream energy sectors continue to generate growth in the quarter similarly to last year the growth from our owneroperator customers is offsetting the weakness and headwinds were seeing from ec and upstream customers the continuous strength of owneroperator demonstrates the significant value aspentech delivers to customers every day as they increase their focus on operational excellence and asset reliability we did have a number of transactions with owneroperators a slip out of the quarter as we have experienced over the past couple of years the current environment puts a premium on sales focus and execution for example contract negotiations are more challenging and transactions experience greater scrutiny from customers before approvals are obtained as we enter the fourth quarter we currently expect to achieve annual spend growth for fiscal year  towards the lower end of our  to  guidance range the guidance assumes a projected attrition rate in line with fiscal  and is supported by the amount of new growth that the company will generate as we stated at the beginning of the fiscal year the challenges in some of our end markets made possible a wider range of outcomes were facing the most disruptive oil price environment in an generation and are still generating growth which we believe is a testament to the missioncritical nature of our products and the strategic relationships we have with customers while were focused on driving higher growth when you consider the macro environment were operating in we feel good about our financial performance and the discipline weve maintained in running the business while making important investments in new areas looking at fiscal year  there are two primary factors weve seen in the market first now that were a quarter into calendar  it has become clear that the  budget cycle for ec customers will reflect the rightsizing of their business that took place in  calendar these customers are facing a year of flat to slight increase in backlogs materially reduced engineering head count and significant cost pressures feedback we have gotten from customers indicate this environment could persist through calendar  were evaluating how to position aspentech for improved growth in this market over time the second dynamic were seeing is related to large deal activity for our msc suite relative to last year we have signed fewer larger deals and the ones we have signed have not been as large overall we continue to see good demand from owneroperators but were coming off of two very strong years of growth in msc and customers are absorbing the significant amount of new token capacity theyve acquired in order to generate the value expected through the implementation of our technology as we have long said there are limits to how much new technology our customers can absorb at any given time we believe this is a temporary phenomenon and would expect to see better growth from this group in fiscal year  we will provide a specific guidance on our growth outlook for fiscal year  at our investor day on june  but i want to provide some high level commentary on our expectations overall we would expect to see growth improve from fiscal year  levels due to the positive impact of the asset performance management or apm suite the customer response we have seen in the first few months since the launch of apm has been very exciting and it is translated into a strong pipeline of opportunities in fact apm opportunities represent about  of our pipeline at this point in the rest of the business we currently anticipate engineering will perform in line with this year and msc will show a slight improvement due to the dynamics i just described with our owneroperator customers we remain optimistic about the longterm opportunity in our core markets and for aspentech overall we have been making significant investments across our product portfolio and we believe well further extend our market leadership and position us for improved growth when the spending environment improve the reason for that optimism was on display last week as we held our biennial optimize user conference which was attended by over  customers and prospects and was more than double the size of our last optimize this years conference focused on our asset optimization strategy and the substantial progress we have made in bringing that vision to reality since we first introduced it at optimize  as we have discussed in the past asset optimization is a holistic approach to asset management that focuses on an assets design operation and maintenance in order to drive the highest possible financial return over its entire life cycle by implementing best practices and realizing efficiencies across all three of these areas we believe customers will improve the reliability of their assets and maximize their longterm value our product vision is to bring all three areas together so customers can leverage the vast amounts of data they already have to drive better more informed decisions on how they manage their assets aspentechs leadership in asset design and asset operations provides a strong foundation to expand into asset maintenance with the apm suite apm represents a major step forward in the market starting with reliability analysis to better understand how to improve the overall reliability of a system of assets an asset or equipment this leverages analytics and machine learning capabilities proactively to improve the degradation pattern or breakdown of this asset we believe apm represents another significant area of opportunity for customers to generate incremental efficiencies and improve on their operational excellence programs ultimately a customer does not benefit from the true value of asset optimization if they have designed and are operating a plant for peak efficiency but the physical plant itself experiences a failure that shuts down production despite decades of investment in preventive maintenance according to arc  of the failures and unplanned downtime are not addressable by this investment we believe that addressing these vital issues for customers represent a significant expansion of the value creation aspentech can provide to customers as well as a meaningful expansion of our tam we look forward to providing greater insight into this potential opportunity at our investor day in june finally there are two other aspects of apm that provide us with the confidence that it will become a greater component of our growth mix in the future and support faster growth over time first the apm suite is mostly targeted at our owneroperator customers in the downstream and chemicals markets where aspentech solutions are used daily as part of their operating expenses by increasing the mix of our business in markets that are not exposed to the cyclicality of capex investments we would expect to see more predictability in our performance secondly we believe apm is more broadly applicable and can provide value in any industry where equipment reliability and uptime are critical business issues we continue to see interest from new customers in these industries as our existing customers further rollout the machine learning capabilities from mtell and our existing oem partner takes mtells products to market in this industry in addition reliability is a top priority in any of these industries and the opportunity to improve it through analytics technology be it machine learning multivariate analysis or root cause analysis will be a growth driver now turning back to our third quarter performance energy engineering and construction and chemicals once again represented greater than  of our business energy was the largest vertical contributor followed by chemicals and engineering and construction i will now provide some color on a few notable transactions signed during the quarter first a global oil company continued their rollout of our adaptive process control technology dmc by upgrading existing controllers to the latest version of our technology this customer will continue to expand the value created from multivariable control applications through this deployment second a global ec company that had been performing ram studies those are reliability availability maintainability studies on a reactive adhoc basis decided to adopt our fidelis reliability product in one of their canadian offices as a new source of revenue by one creating the ability to offer ram studies to their customers proactively two making available to project teams an effective means of review and scope of deliverables and ensuring competitive bids and three maintaining client engagement through both the capex and opex investment cycles third our global chemical customer decided to expand their use of mtells machine learning capabilities in one of their largest us site and expects to rollout the mtell product to all their chemical sites in the united states this decision was based on the longterm success of the mtell technology coupled with aspentechs technical and financial capacity finally a latin american producer of chemicals that was a first customer in the region to implement our dmc technology in its chemical operations is expanding the use of dmc based on the incremental value captured from it and the reduction in time and resources to implement it while were making investments to extend aspentechs reach into new markets and product areas we continue to run the business with a focus on expense discipline we believe our ability to make incremental investments for growth while maintaining the strong levels of profitability is a core component of our business model as karl will detail later our strong yeartodate profitability performance enables us to raise our fiscal  nongaap operating income our substantial free cash flow is a strategic asset for the company that we continue to deploy in ways that deliver value for shareholders in the third quarter we returned another  million to shareholders by repurchasing  million shares our buyback program which has been in place since  hit a milestone during the quarter as we have now returned more than  billion to shareholders since the plans inception it is our intention to continue to buy back shares as long as market and business conditions are favorable before i turn the call over to karl i wanted to provide an update on our executive management team effective july  were promoting michele triponey currently aspentechs senior vice president of customer success to executive vice president of field operations in this role michele will be responsible for overseeing all global sales and services michele has been a valued member of the aspentech team since  and has a deep understanding of our customers the industries we serve and the value our products deliver for customers every day michele and i have worked closely together since  as she took on increasing levels of responsibility within our global sales and services organization i look forward to partnering with michele in her new role and believe her experience will enhance the companys ability to execute on our growth initiatives in this environment bill griffin who has served as executive vice president of field operations since january of  has left the company in order to pursue other opportunities i like to thank bill for his efforts at aspentech and wish him well in the future in summary aspentech continues to deliver positive growth and significant profitability in a challenging spending environment were focused on using our financial strength to extend our product portfolio and market leadership to better position the company for faster growth customer reaction to our product innovation has been terrific and we continue to be optimistic about the longterm prospects for the company with that let me turn the call over to karl karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc thanks antonio i will now review our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal  beginning with the annual spend annual spend which is a proxy for the value of our recurring term license business at the end of each period specifically the annualized value of our term license and maintenance revenue was  million at the end of the quarter which is an increase of  on a yearoveryear basis and  sequentially let me now turn to our quarterly financial results beginning on a gaap basis total revenue of  million was consistent with a  million in the prior year period and was above the highend of our guidance range of a  million to  million as a reminder in the third quarter of  we recognized  million of nonrecurring subscription and software revenue breaking this down further subscription and software revenue was a  million for the third quarter which is consistent with a  million in the prior year period and compares to a  million last quarter when looking at sequential comparisons remember that we recognized subscription revenue on a daily basis and the third quarter has two fewer days than the second quarter which equates to approximately a  million sequential decline services and other revenue was  million compared to  million in the year ago period and  million last quarter the timing of services revenue can fluctuate between periods based on customer demand turning to profitability gross profit was  million in the quarter with a gross margin of  which compares to a  million and gross margin of  in the year ago period operating expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the prior year period total gaap expenses including cost of revenue were  million down from  million in the year ago period and up from  million last quarter as a reminder in the third quarter of fiscal  we had approximately  million of acquisitionrelated expenses operating income was  million for the third quarter fiscal  representing an operating margin of  which is an increase compared to  million or  operating margin in the prior year period net income for the quarter was  million or  per share compared to net income of  million or  per share in the third quarter fiscal  turning to our nongaap results excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense amortization of intangibles associated with acquisition acquisitionrelated expenses and noncapitalized acquired technology we reported nongaap operating income for the third quarter of  million representing a  nongaap operating margin compared to a nongaap operating income and margin of  million and  respectively in the yearago period nongaap net income was  million or  of nongaap eps in the third quarter of fiscal  based on  million shares outstanding compared to nongaap net income of  million or  of nongaap eps in the third quarter of fiscal  based on  million shares outstanding turning to the balance sheet and cash flow we ended the third quarter with  million in cash and marketable securities a decrease of  million from the end of last quarter during the third quarter we repurchased  million shares for  million under our stockrepurchase program through the first three quarters of fiscal  we have returned  million shares or  million to shareholders demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy our deferred revenue balance was  million at the end of the third quarter representing a  increase compared to the end of the year ago period and  increase on a sequential basis as a reminder our deferred revenue balance is heavily influenced by the timing of invoices and over the course of the year we expect deferred revenue growth to generally be in line with the underlying growth in the business however there can be some quartertoquarter variability from a cash flow perspective we generated  million of cash from operations during the third quarter and  million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures capitalized software and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated expenses a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap results is provided in the tables within our press release which is also available on our website id now like to close with thoughts regarding our updated financial outlook for fiscal  as well as guidance for the fourth quarter for the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of  million to  million nongaap operating income of  million to  million and nongaap eps of  per share to  per share on a gaap basis we expect fourth quarter operating income of  million to  million and eps of  per share to  per share turning to the full year were raising our revenue guidance and now expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million which compares to our previous guidance of  million to  million from a mix perspective we continue to expect subscription software to comprise greater than  of revenue with our services and other revenue representing the remainder from an expense perspective were adjusting our assumption for total gaap costs and expenses to  million to  million which compares to our previous guidance of approximately  million to  million we expect gaap operating income in the range of  million to  million net income in the range of  million to  million and gaap eps of  per share to  per share this compares to our previous guidance of gaap operating income of  million to  million net income of  million to  million and gaap eps of  per share to  per share from a nongaap perspective we now expect nongaap operating income in the range of  million to  million which is up from our previous guidance of  million to  million for the full year fiscal  this would lead to nongaap earnings per share in the range of  per share to  per share which is an increase from our previous guidance of  per share to  per share for the fiscal year with respect to annual spend as antonio mentioned we expect to deliver full year growth towards the lower end of our  to  guidance range in terms of free cash flow we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance of a  million to a  million for the year in summary aspentechs third quarter performance demonstrates our ability to deliver positive growth and strong earnings and cash flow in a difficult environment at the same time were making significant progress on a strategic priority that we believe will deliver longterm growth and additional shareholder value with that we are now happy to take your questions operator lets begin the qa questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of matt pfau matthew charles pfau  william blair  co llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions antonio antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc hi matt matthew charles pfau  william blair  co llc hey just wanted to start out with digging in a little bit to the preview you gave for fiscal  and with respect to the apm suite potentially helping accelerate revenue growth so it sounds like in terms of the pressure youve seen in  some of it has been on the ec side but then also a bit on the msc suite as well in terms of not as many large deals or maybe more work in terms of getting some of those deals pushed across but maybe you can parse out the difference of getting these apm deals across versus maybe some of the issues that you have seen with some of these msc deals antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc well i mean look i wont get into specifics of deals what i will say though is certainly we did close a handful of apmrelated deals both with reliability analysis software and machine learning and were happy about that were also very excited about the reaction that we got at optimize last week from our customers with regards to our engineering and msc business in general what ill tell you is look i think over the last two years in order for us to deliver the performance that we have delivered both financial performance and growth performance it has required tremendous focus on our details both on how we manage the business and how we execute in our sales organization and in q we hit a bump in the road with respect to our sales execution but i dont expect that that will be the case going forward so matthew charles pfau  william blair  co llc got it okay and then wanted to touch on the guidance a little bit karl im trying to parse out the difference between revenue guidance going up for the year and then being more towards the lower end of the annual spend guidance whats sort of the difference there between the two karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc so its really just the timing of how the annual spend comes in during the year and for this our revenue for the year is already baked because of the annual spend that we close in q wont have an impact to revenue until q so its a little bit of seeing that also weve talked in couple other calls weve accelerated a little bit of the cash basis revenue and weve seen that come in and its been a little bit of a benefit for that matthew charles pfau  william blair  co llc okay got it and then in terms of the reduction in the expense guidance any changes there in terms of spending plans or hiring plans that is impacting that guidance karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc i mean a little bit of it is just in q were a little bit behind the expenses due to hiring which you cant make that up because some people got hired later in the quarter and some got pushed to q so its a little bit of that its not a change in the investment strategy of how were deploying it its just a little bit of timing and then its also how we see the people coming in and those investments being made in q being pushed a little bit so not a change in the strategy of how were investing but maybe a little bit more in kind of the timing piece of it matthew charles pfau  william blair  co llc got it okay ill pass it along thanks for taking my questions guys antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of monika garg antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc hi monika monika garg  pacific crest hi antonio thanks for your time thanks for taking the questions first is we have seen some improvement in oil prices end markets right but not really improvement in the annual spend and especially the way youre guiding for the year would be modestly lower annual spend growth yearoveryear maybe could you talk about what we need to see to pick up in the annual spend from here and maybe touch upon kind of the sales execution in q what you little bit talked about antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc okay well i mean look as probably you have seen oil companies are reporting increased earnings in the last week or so and thats as a result of oil being around  a barrel for the past few months now in those same articles what you hear and i attended ceraweek in houston in early march and heard it directly from the ceos of these oil companies that attended that conference and that they are also very focused on expense management cost controls and running their businesses very lean the ceo of total was very proud of having become the most profitable oil company in the last quarter and there was a lot of bragging around that so there was a lot of bragging about their ability to produce oil profitably at  a barrel which emphasizes the point on expense management and control and just in general bill tightening but very little announcements about new projects in upstream which is really where the capex investment starts being generated ive also read an article in the wall street journal where they talked about the five largest western oil companies taking on  billion of debt over the last two years three years to finance their dividends so i think some of this profitability ends up going to address or delever those companies and just in general builder cash portfolios what do i think is going to take for capex spend and eventually annual spend to grow in the engineering business i think its for the oil supply and demand balance to get more skewed towards higher demand and supply or the supply shrinking to a level where it signals to oil companies that if theyre going to invest in new projects theres going to be a market for that oil of course the dynamic right now at  is shale producers getting back into the game because they are the most profitable operators and they are driving oil production and therefore mitigating the rise in the oil price and thats why you see oil prices bouncing between  a barrel and  a barrel and theres also an opinion that that will continue for longer but i think its about the supply and demand balance coming much more into balance and a signal to oil producers that they can go ahead and invest in this bigger projects when that will happen if i had that answer for you id probably make a lot of money monika garg  pacific crest thanks then you talked about  of pipeline is in apm how to think about pipeline translation to revenue what im trying to understand is is your pipeline like  months of revenue or a year of annual spend so kind of to gauge quantitatively the  of pipeline in the apm antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc well i wont talk about the specific but we do look at our quarter pipeline as a metric that weve always tracked here even before i became ceo as a head of field operations is a metric that i used to track and that metric is – the pipeline is in line with the metric our historical performance is bounced up and down a little bit over the  months to  months but its also the velocity of conversion of that pipeline and that sometimes what we experience in q and not only our largest transaction for the quarter moved out of the quarter but also a number of other deals and i think theres a combination of factors but certainly i dont like to make excuses and were here to deliver outcomes and sales execution is what we focus on so well correct that going forward and get back on a more healthy growth path monika garg  pacific crest got it then karl you announced an acquisition of rights to ots software in april so is there any revenue you are baking in for the fq guidance from this deal karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc no so the deal was really to just acquiring rights to technology so it didnt come with customers or contracts or anything else just literally buying the technology monika garg  pacific crest all right and just the last one deferred revenue growth yearoveryear was just kind of modestly up  maybe could you walk through that or is it kind of just a factor of annual spend growth karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc no its a factor of two different things the first is when you look at the deferred revenue we give the whole amount but you really need to focus on just the current the longterm is a kind of a hangover for some singlepays and some ops deals that were linked to licenses that are just kind of amortizing down so if you look at the longterm deferred revenue you see that kind of coming down ratably over time so when you look at just the current piece it had an increase of about – i think it was around  q over q which is more in line with what youd expect but the second piece that influenced it was we had a couple of large renewals at the end of quarter that closed in q but because of the payment didnt do until the next quarter because they get  days what ends up happening is it comes out of what normally would have been in deferred revenue and it doesnt go back in until q and if you kind of factor those and youd be more at that  or   yearoveryear growth in deferred monika garg  pacific crest got it thank you so much antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc yeah operator your next question come from the line of david hynes david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc thanks guys so maybe we could start with annual spend attrition and i know its a metric that you share only annually but can you give us an update on how thats tracking at least relative to what we saw last year i think last year you said it was  i mean is it going to be more or less in line or were going to see an uptick in attrition what should we expect when q comes around antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc well i think thats what weve mentioned we havent been able to make inroads into that attrition rate that is basically mostly driven by the ec business weve put in place initiatives in fiscal  at the beginning of the year to see if we could mitigate that attrition rate of  last year and what were finding is as i mentioned in my notes or in my script that the dynamic is one where these customers have right sized their businesses to a number of engineering personnel head count there is a certain amount of entitlement that they need for our software to match that head count and thats what the discussions end up being certainly there has been some cases where weve been successful expanding usage of the products but what were finding like with the oil companies there is a strong focus on cost control and expense management and thats whats coming through david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah okay and then moving on i guess to the sales head transition maybe some color kind of when did this happened how extensive of a search did you guys go through i mean youre putting somebody with largely a services background at the head of your sales team when you guys are embarking on a pretty major new effort with apm so curious the thought process behind that and any additional color you could share on – michele and how youre thinking about that team antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc yeah certainly look i wont talk about the specifics of when bill departed the company or the reasons for it but as an executive officer of the company we have certain requirements to report and that probably will give you the answer with respect to michele look michele has been a member of not only my executive team as ceo but my predecessors executive team as well she is also the executive sponsor for some of our large accounts in the company and she engages with customers on a regular basis in her role as a svp of customer success she has to understand and drive her organization to engage with customers in order to make sure our products are being implemented the adoption of those products implemented is sustained and in general provide support in addition to just being exposed on a daily basis to our sales organization so i have no concerns whatsoever with micheles capabilities and experience to step up into that role especially in the context of the environment that were dealing with and that it is an environment that requires a strong focus on execution and that really means a strong focus on details a strong knowledge of our products a strong institutional knowledge understanding of our customers our customers deploy our products and how they get value from those products so if you look at the current environment and you look at micheles experience capability skills and qualifications i think michele is actually a perfect fit for this environment we did not conduct a search i was happy to select michele to step into the role she has worked for me for about seven years i know her very well she is a grinder and i know shell come in and play that role in addition i will partner with her to make sure that not only she is successful but the company is successful going forward so david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc im very happy for michele she deserves a promotion she was the best qualified person for that job considering what the company is going through and with respect to apm michele has been involved in our apm strategy helping put words to the strategy involved with some of the acquisitions and in the overall process including setting up a professional services team customer support and so on so she will have no problem theres also other decisions and actions that were taking around our apm business that well ensure thats a business that will launch and taken care of so hope that answers your question dj david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc no that does and look forward to engaging with her at the analyst day here coming up maybe one last question for karl free cash flow typically theres some pretty big seasonality right i mean i look back to my model which goes back to like   and q has always been kind of the highest free cash flow quarter of the year sometimes quite noticeably and to get to the midpoint of your reiterated guidance implies that q cash flow is actually going to be better than q so is there something unusual going on this year why is it different than the previous whatever it is seven or eight years karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc yeah so we feel comfortable about the guidance and were on track for hitting it what really happened in q dj was for our international customers we need to get a certificate from the irs beginning of each calendar year and this year the irs was about four weeks to six weeks behind in schedule and getting those out and so by the time we got them to our customers it delayed them paying us so we pushed off – probably about  million to  million got pushed off out of the quarter into q i think weve gotten almost all of it by this third week of april so were back on track it was really just the irs slow because they had a hiring freeze in the service so they just got backlogged in getting us certificates but not that it will impact the yeartodate or the full year david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc okay that makes sense okay great thanks for all the color guys antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark schappel antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc hi mark mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc hey hi good evening thanks for taking my question just one question here i want to come back to karl and karl id like you to go back to an earlier question regarding the annual spend and could you just go through one more time the divergence between the lower than expected annual spend and the higher revenue guide karl e johnsen  aspen technology inc sure so the easy way to look at it if you look at our yeartodate results and then you can walk forward from that for the q revenue to get to the kind of the full year guide and what you do is were going to have to pick up a day of revenue in the fourth quarter which is probably about  million  million and then you get the annual spend from q that comes in so thats the easy way to do the math to get there and then you kind of get a little bit of fluctuation around the services revenue but the overarching view is that its how the annual spend comes in during the year so if annual spend comes in closer to the front of the year you get more of that revenue throughout the year if its spread towards the backend you get less of it so its a little bit of the timing of where we were at the beginning – our initial viewpoint at the beginning of the year when we were looking at forecasting revenue annual spend has come in a little differently and then the last piece is really we got a little bit of a benefit from cash basis customers may have a little bit of good viewpoint into those in the fourth quarter that kind of rounds out the answer to that so its really those three legs to the stool mark w schappel  the benchmark co llc thank you thats helpful operator there are no further audio questions at this time ill now turn the call back over to antonio antonio j pietri  aspen technology inc thank you natalie sic namdi  and thank you
