investment opportunities october  – our niche product newsletter    one of the reasons gps can provide investors with above market returns is due to our operating a niche product service skill and culture are other reasons in general terms gps loans are too big for the bank manager but too small for their property departments when reengineering the gps business postgfc there were several items i wanted to enshrine into the gps business model such as  we do senior debt senior debt and only senior debt we do not do second mortgages mezzanine funding joint ventures and the like  we stick to our longestablished and proven niche product  it is all about looking after our investors’ best interests the rest will follow from providing good service  not to become an institution to stick to being a small and tightly run business my initial study was on the viability of the business where i developed the following graph which shows the income to gps against funds under management what came out of the study is that if you do not have enough funds under management you cannot generate a consistent return with fixed overheads eating away at profit then came the strong return phase which included overheads for a small but competent team that was not reliant upon one or two people the graph then shows that as the business becomes larger and heading towards being an institution the overhead costs and margin from lending reduced profitability i then looked at investors’ returns the graph was quite similar which means the best interests of investors and gps coincide when there is a smaller amount of funds under management a consistent return was not possible as usage ratios were lower then came the strong return phase to investors where there was consistent usage of funds under management returns to investors then starts to drop the traditional gps loan product and market only has a limited depth and increasing lending past this point leads to either a lowering of quality of loans or lending into more competitive markets by the time you are at institution size you are doing home loans as that is where the volume is in the australian lending market if you are lending money at around  to borrowers and want a margin then investors are going to get very little return another aspect was my personal knowledge of loans when lending is only a small part of the overall business it can be left to others there is then the number of loans which my comprehension can absorb as the number of loans increases beyond my capacity to comprehend my knowledge of each loan declines thanks to the loyal and longestablished gps investor base we are now sitting in the “niche market” quadrant for funds under management i revisited my analysis work on this topic when reviewing the  fund performance summary from another wellknown mortgage fund in five years their funds under management has grown from approximately  million to approximately  billion but returns on their pooled fund have gone from  to  distributions from the gps invest pooled fund have grown in this period to a very consistent  pa i think this proves my point however i am confident that the other wellknown mortgage fund would not agree tweet recent updates view all updates july  – to grow or not to grow the focus of our strategic review for the  financial year say goodbye to the cranes

sending this story thanks for sharing oops we messed up try again later last updated august  theres almost no excuse for getting lost anymore using gps global positioning system is a fact of modern life—whether its on your smartphone built into your car or as a standalone portable navigation device that can be moved from car to car most of us are familiar with how gps makes travel easier you can choose routing preferences fastest no tolls or most fuelefficient and sometimes get realtime traffic info the system works via satellite and can be set to show icons for gas stations or hospitals or direct you to points of interest like national parks or tourist attractions   many factors will determine which gps system is best for you including price features screen size and portability—but most important are you glued to your smartphone if so you’ll be drawn to phone apps or incar infotainment systems we give the pros and cons of portable units as well as builtins and apps life is a highway you can choose from many gps systems—those that harness the power of your smartphone versions that are builtin to the car and portable units the last of which we have actually tested check our full gps ratings for more available to subscribers smartphone gps apps typical advantages of these are that they are often free involve hardware a phone that you already own and are always uptodate how they work hop in the car with your smartphone and choose a preloaded app such as google maps or apple maps or download the likes of here waze or mapquest and your phone service gives you multiple options for a smoother trip complete with traffic views alternateroute suggestions and warnings if you’re going too fast the oftenbright displays of these apps can make them easy to read on a sundrenched dashboard plus you don’t have to buy any other gps device—because you already have the smartphone—nor do you have to worry about carrying around a portable navigation device pnd phones can also do things pnds cant such as warn you to leave early for a calendar appointment if traffic looks bad or based on your past history a phone app shows estimated travel time to your frequent destination on the lock screen if you dont particularly like the navigation app that came with your phone you have other great choices via the app store many of them free see “free ride top map apps” below for more info compared to portables or most indash options the apps are easier to update automatically loading the latest maps consider this using phonebased phone gps apps eats up precious data from your monthly plan and some conk out during phone calls or when your cellular signal drops some apps work around this by saving maps to your phone so you wont lose your way—even if you lose phone service whichever option you choose you’ll likely need to purchase a mount car charger since navigation can quickly deplete a battery and possibly a data plan for your phone if you don’t already have one incar infotainment systems with factory gps carmakers builtin proprietary infotainment systems typically work without a pluggedin smartphone how they work it used to be that integrated factory systems were often the most expensive type of navigation aid however more and more cars are rolling off the assembly line complete with multifaceted infotainment systems that combine hardware and software to do things like regulate climate controls provide updates on the engine and other systems offer bluetooth connectivity incar internet wifi and typically offer a navigation option newer cars have the infotainment system screen built into the dashboard and you adjust it using the touchscreen steering wheel controls or voice commands with older cars that aren’t infotainment systemcapable you could install a gps unit but would still need a professionally installed aftermarket head unit to run a full infotainment system like pnds builtin gps systems work via satellite so you won’t end up lost if you lose cell phone service consider this in our tests we find that the quality of the carmakers’ branded infotainment systems varies widely and highrated systems don’t necessarily align with highrated cars if you dont like the infotainment system that came with your car you can opt for phonebased apps such as googles android auto and apple carplay which plug your smartphone into a car that supports either app see our reviews of infotainment systems proprietary to brands as well as the favorites from our survey covering more than  cars android auto and apple carplay these integrated infotainment systems are built into your car or professionally installed aftermarket and use either a pluggedin android smartphone or iphone as a conduit how they work increasingly new cars come equipped with infotainment systems a mix of hardware and software that combines information and entertainment to give access to navigation and audio systems usb and bluetooth connectivity incar internet and wifi among other features there are proprietary infotainment systems from carmakers such as chrysler gm and hyundai that run without a phone see “incar infotainment systems…” for more on these but more and more automakers are supporting these two smartphonebased infotainment systems from google and apple android auto and apple carplay plug into a systemsupporting car and voila you’re seamlessly connected a modified version of your smartphone screen with larger icons and an editeddown menu appears on the indash screen allowing you to use the phone and apps in a less distracting way since you’re already addicted to…er familiar with your smartphone’s ways this saves the bother of learning the ins and outs of an automaker’s possibly clunky proprietary system older cars would need a professionallyinstalled aftermarket head unit the current market price for caplayandroid autocapable units is around  installed consider this since it’s your phone you already know how it works and can “hey siri” and “ok google” as usual however these platforms only run approved apps—for example you can’t get google maps on apples system and you might want to check that your favorite musicstreaming service or podcatcher is supported the phonepowered navigation automatically updates maps and other apps telematics systems these “concierge”style call buttons came on the scene in the mid s how they work carmakers combine gps and cellular technology to access emergency help or a variety of convenience services from the vehicle systems include bmw assist gm onstar toyota entune hyundai blue link lexus safety connect and mercedesbenz mbrace specific services—both paid and free—vary the systems typically offer a menu of services including emergency crash notification and assistance a stolenvehicle locater and roadside assistance some telematics systems will unlock your car door remotely navigation is typically one of the services provided via a basic graphic display showing each coming turn along with voice direction advantages include ease of use and being able to ask for directions by talking to a human at the other end of the line even while driving another plus is that you dont have to pay for updated mapping information older cars with telematics but lacking dash screens will have you interact with a computerized voice when getting directions consider this on the downside these systems can be expensive and you have to be in an area with good cell phone coverage for them to work typically the vehicle has to be equipped from the factory although some companies offer costly aftermarket installation car companies may offer an initial trial period of the service then charge a service fee it’s a good idea to study up beforehand on what is a paid service and what’s not check with individual carmakers for more info about particular systems portable gps the name says it all—they can move with you from car to car how they work like builtin systems these are connected to a satellite so—unlike cell phone apps—they can never freeze and leave you stranded when you lose phone service portables usually offer the same features as builtin systems plus more—and often cost less typically the volume can be turned up louder than phone apps portables are compact and easy to carry with you or share with others realtime traffic reporting is usually reasonably priced and voice commands are sometimes available we’ve found that map updates are less costly than with builtins some models even come with lifetime updates for a modest charge some newer models come with bluetooth handsfree calling and dashboard camcorders that can save footage of a trip and in the case of an accident capture still images consider this screens are usually smaller than indash models and potentially hard to read voice command programming capability is soso compared to the best car systems these should be securely mounted and placed where they won’t interfere with airbag deployment or block visibility other disadvantage your phone already has builtin gps with a free app buying a portable device is an additional purchase—and something to carry around it’s worth noting that battery life is minimal or can decrease over time if the battery loses its charge you have to connect via power cord it’s best to routinely charge the battery when batteries die on some models the unit must be replaced and usually when you leave the car a portable should be hidden or removed to deter thieves prices range from about  to  portable gps ratings oh the places you’ll go most gps navigators will home in on a destination but not always via the most efficient route a few tips tailored to your typical travel conditions tell you what you can’t live or drive without easy to use making navigation easier is the prime directive of these gadgets so look at our easeofuse scores in the ratings for pnds the models that tested high for us make it especially easy to enter destinations even by speaking them and give the most helpful directions some interfaces are more intuitive than others and lowscorers can be awkward slow or both keeps track of traffic if you tend to stick to a routine on your commute or errands you might get the most use out of a navigation system or app that offers realtime traffic info you’ll know about—and avoid—accidents road closures and speed traps bear in mind that traffic reporting on portable gps units or preinfotainmentsystem builtins is not perfect it can be inaccurate or outdated phone apps that offer realtime traffic allow you to peek in on traffic cameras and allow for crowd sourced tips on tieups and detours shows stamina if you have more than one car or often rent cars you might prefer a portable system or smartphone app that’s always there riding shotgun on your travels if you’ll be using a pnd for walking or accessing multimedia features outside of the car look for a battery that has at least two hours on a charge the matter of size if you have a hard time deciphering tiny maps consider a builtin or infotainment system which generally have larger screens you can even go really big with special pnds for commercial trucks vans and rvs since dashboards are farther away from the driver’s seat these models will also take into account lowbridge clearance and parkway restrictions however if you often pack a gps unit in your suitcase you may want to go smaller for a pnd screen large enough to read easily without blocking your view we’ve found a inch diagonal screen a good compromise for travelers but for regular use a inch size is easier to work with latest gps ratings free ride top map apps if you’re a fan of your phone you’re probably already using a free navigation app these are some we like apple maps offers d views as well as the birdseyeview flyover feature youll get realtime traffic monitoring and turnbyturn spoken directions it even gives public transportation guidance

the distance consider these options and our gps ratings when buying a portable navigation device pnd power supply all portable systems can be powered through a cars volt socket and all have an internal rechargeable battery we found that those units typically operate for  to  hours on a charge although our testing has revealed significant variance among models internal power also allows you to practice using the system and program driving destinations while you are away from the car or to use the device as a handheld tool when traveling walking or bicycling an ac power adapter is sometimes included with the systems allowing the device to be used and recharged indoors many can also be charged via a computer’s usb port screen size weve tested portable systems with screens ranging from  to  inches the smallest can be hard to see and their small touchscreen buttons can make it tedious to enter an address on the other hand the largest units can be bulky to carry and tend to obstruct more of your view when mounted to the windshield a inch screen measured diagonally is acceptable but inch screens are easier to read and use while still being easily portable larger screens are increasingly available and these big units can be especially useful for trucks or rvs where the windshield is far from the driver realtime traffic reports units with traffic information can alert you to a problem or slowdown ahead in time to avoid it the realtime data is available to subscribers through a cellphone network fm signal or satellite radio service the quality of information—like any traffic reporting—can vary or be less than current were seeing more and more devices with free advertisingsupported traffic information but some are still subscription based and some require an additional receiver costing up to  some models factor in historical traffic data when calculating routes and can guide you around known congestion patterns such as rushhour traffic  detour request if you see traffic building up ahead a manual detour button will find you an alternative route some models allow the user to select a specific distance to route around a problem trafficcapable devices integrate their traffic information with detouring functions prompting a user to choose an alternative route when traffic conditions are unfavorable that can be helpful in evaluating options before changing course photo garmin nuvi reality view and lane assistance realistic depiction of major junctions with lanespecific visual directions inform a driver in advance of their next maneuver basically it tells you which exit ramp is yours and the lane assistance indicates the appropriate lane via an arrow for the driver to travel in order to execute their upcoming maneuver photo navigon mounting hardware manufacturers typically use an angled rigid arm to attach the unit to a suction cup or magnet look for a unit that is easy to install and remove from the mount typically a unit slides onto a mount or snaps into it the power cord either plugs into the mount or directly into the unit weve found the most convenient models have the cord plugging directly into the mount allowing you to snap in and release the unit with the push of a button check local laws for any restrictions on placement foreign languages many units offer spoken and displayed directions in spanish and french in addition to english and several have even more choices some tomtom models can provide spoken directions in more than  languages but cant display them all on the screen for specific language needs check with the device manufacturers website for the latest outofthebox abilities and additional language features that might be available by download photo youtube morefun digi
