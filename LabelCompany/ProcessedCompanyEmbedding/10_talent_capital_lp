of talent capital  returns  lifescivclifescivc blog about me from the trenches recovering scientist turned early stage vc a biotech optimist fighting gravity the inescapable gravity of biotech’s key clusters the great consolidation of talent capital  returns posted march st  in bioentrepreneurship biotech financing boston cluster talent two key geographic clusters dominate the biotech landscape today these two areas boston and san francisco combine a unique blend of biomedical science venture capital entrepreneurial talent risktaking culture and geographic density other regions have some or all of these elements but not in the same magnitude or momentum that boston and san francisco have today – and the gap is just getting bigger last year gen ranked boston  and san francisco  in their biotech clusters report here others have covered these clusters and the rivalry between them here as the economist did with “clusterluck” earlier in  but rather than draw distinctions between them i’d like to focus on these key clusters relative to the rest of the biopharma ecosystem context relative to the us biotech scene europe is often viewed as a laggard in the biopharma space from an entrepreneurial perspective of course there are notable exceptions – like actelion’s incredible success – but by and large there’s limited funding limited rdveteran entrepreneurship and risktaking and limited prospects for scaling companies while there is great science across many worldclass research institutions in europe the commercialization of their science into local startups and emerging biopharma companies remains a challenge two relevant analyses were captured in the datarich report from hbm partners on the ma environment which highlight the essence of this challenge from a venture perspective usbased biotechs drove faster exits here with higher investment return multiples here than their eu counterparts these data are striking  but how much of this outperformance was driven by the two key clusters in massachusetts and san francisco i’ll refer to them as the “key clusters” from now on in an attempt to answer this i’ve worked with pitchbook to assemble some data on these two key clusters relative to the rest of the us as well as europe the quick conclusion is that the rest of the us should likely use the euro as its biotech currency outside the key clusters the rest of the us biotech sector performs and looks a lot like the european ecosystem as shown in the charts below examining either ma or ipo events between  biopharma startups from the key clusters were roughly two years faster at the median to get to that exit outcome left chart  years to ma or ipo versus  years  the quartile ranges are shown as well  similar timeline differentials are evident in prior time periods over the past decade as well in terms of value biopharma startups in the key clusters have outperformed both on the median upfront ma and the median ipo premoney valuations during  right chart the average dramatically skews the distribution upwards in the key clusters due to big outliers again this differential in value also exists during other time windows of the past decade holding periods and valuations at exit are reasonable but only directional proxies for investor returns the actual returns depend on pricing of each of the venture rounds as well as timing of stock sales etc  but it’s reasonable to assume based on these data that biotech returns in the two key clusters have outperformed other regions why is differential in performance happening biotech historians in the future might call it the “great consolidation of talent and capital” while silicon valley quickly emerged in tech a few decades ago as the nexus of all things it and venture capital in biotech it’s been far more geographically egalitarian in the past  san francisco and boston were clearly important leaders in the early decades of the field but so were other biotech clusters seattle san diego raleigh phillynj colorado etc…  most of these also had legacy pharma or big biotech footprints that were important for cultivation of talent  and great firms grew out of places well beyond boston and san francisco early winners like immunex idec centacor medimmune and celltech just to name a few – and firms like celgene san deigo nj and amgen thousand oaks – all born in other geographies in recent years this has changed – boston and san francisco are now the preeminent biotech clusters  and their gravity in the ecosystem is only getting stronger beyond having great science and the right “pixie dust” in the local environment two fundamentally important ingredients to the success of any cluster are capital and talent – and both are aggregating into the two key clusters capital over the past decade startups in the key clusters have been consuming evergreater portions of the global biotech venture capital pie as shown in the chart below since  these two key clusters have increased their share by more than  now securing nearly half of the global venture capital funding budget for biotech in the us alone depending on the data source the two clusters are now receiving  of the country’s venture pie both the rest of the us and the eu have shrunk on a relative basis as a response  the percent change in absolute dollars reflects this – nearly  increase in five years into the two key clusters with the other regions relatively flat or down looking back to  most of the change has occurred in the past five years – the distribution of capital across geographies were nearly the same between  on top of the flow of venture capital other funding sources are also consolidating into these geographies take nih funding for instance california and massachusetts rank first and second in terms of total nih funding to its institutions  and massachusetts ranks a farandaway first with regards to nih funding per capita nearly x higher than most other strong states like ca ny pa nj etc five of the top six nihfunded independent research hospitals are in the boston area here  fund flows like these further contribute to the consolidation of biomedical activity into the key clusters however it’s important to call attention to the disconnect between where scientific discoveries are made and where startups are formed many of the new companies that get created or launched in the two key clusters do not have scientific roots in those regions as an example from our own portfolio here at atlas venture despite nearly all of our startups being locatedformed in cambridge ma the founding science is sourced from all over the globe unum came from singapore avrobio from toronto padlock from florida quartet from epfl in switzerland delinia from san francisco etc… about a third of our new startups have roots or connections into boston’s research institutions a third with institutions across the rest of the country and a third outside of the us so the concentration of capital doesn’t mean scientific sources have shrunk in fact it’s increasingly clear to us that science competes on a global stage and we need to access the best substrate wherever it may be – but put the startup where it can take advantage of the benefits of a key biotech cluster talent it’s much harder to quantify the talent metrics but one only has to see all the cranes in cambridge ma to know that big things are happening here nearly every major biopharma company has a research footprint in the region  same goes for the bay area though much more spread out around the region to get a sense for the consolidation of talent here’s a chart that attempts to capture the change in biopharma rd employment in the three geographic groupings  the key clusters have seen rd employment grow by  in past decade versus shrinking in the other major biopharma states like panj europe according to their pharma trade group is flat – though i suspect the metric is actually down in pharma rd organizations and up in the cro rd world  as a macro point these data reflect the intuitive sense we have of recruiting talent from other regions into boston with regards to rd teams prior pharma hubs are shrinking rapidly while boston is growing we’ve even recruited a few sunloving san diego biopharma vets to move to the boston market recently as this implies for startup biotechs larger biopharma companies are the lifeblood of the talent flows prior blog on topic is here most of our early stage startups are led by teams with experiences inside of larger rd organizations the serial cycle of biotech entrepreneurship – starting companies recruiting talent discovering new medicines and getting acquired or going public – is accelerated in high density clusters the entrepreneurial diaspora enabled by biotech ma is just much larger and more vibrant in these clusters here as shown by the data above faster timelines more acquisitions and more rd talent flows just add more and more water to the millrace powering the wheel of the biotech mill churning out startups in these key clusters as these data suggest the great consolidation of talent and capital into the two key clusters has clearly been happening in the past decade – and shows no signs of abating any time soon while the prior return metrics of time and value are clearly lagging indicators of an ecosystem as they reflect the value creation pace and trajectory in the past few years metrics around talent and capital flows into startups will most definitely shape the future of these ecosystems so what are the implications of this consolidation for different stakeholders in the ecosystem  here are a few thoughts if you are a sector or civic leader in one of the key clusters some simple advice don’t get complacent make sure the local infrastructure doesn’t fail you at the most critical moment congestion commutes and chaos can only lead to an exodus over time of those interested in a better quality of life further building capacity to grow will be important scarce lab space has already driven rents in cambridge to outlandish levels we’re seeing startups begin to move back out to the rt  corridor while still part of the greater boston ecosystem those locations are less hyperconnected to the benefits of the density and proximity of the kendall biotech scene lastly make sure you keep importing ideas and talent into the cluster from around the world or you risk becoming insular ideas are global talent is mobile – so keep focusing on bringing them into the region if you aren’t in a cluster today different stakeholders might think about this challenge differently a few themes can’t beat ‘em join ‘em one school of thought would suggest that rather than fighting the consolidation work to benefit from it  if you are an academic investigator interested in founding a new company and you want to maximize its chances of success you might consider putting the startup in a key cluster and create virtual links back to your lab elsewhere in the us or europe we’ve done this successfully many times you’ll need connections into those clusters but some creative use of email and social media can usually get you that if you are a tech transfer executive you might also work to build connectivity with venture creation firms in the key clusters give them an offer they can’t refuse the alternative for economic development minded folks in other regions is to enable your local startups with “extra” advantages provide rd credits or funding like texas did with cprit grants – these significant funding infusions lower the costofcapital for young startups and let them progress with less equity investment since its less available outside of clusters unclear whether these are sustainable in the long run but they could help prime the pump it’s also important to cultivate more anchor tenants to remain or build in the region easier said than done but the revolving door of talent from larger biopharma into smaller companies is a crucial component to a successful cluster along those lines facilitating the return of your regions biopharma diaspora could help many exec’s in the key clusters hail from other parts of the country or world and some wouldn’t mind returning “home” like former california investor jd vance recently did with ohio i’m sure tax deductions to successful returnees would spur lots of interest at the end of the day in the face of this ongoing consolidation regions need to figure out how to give their startups a leg up to compete without a major disadvantage be the big fish in the small pond this is a riff off the ageold contrarian investor thesis much like biotech has been a recent contrarian bet in venture capital amongst many lp’s creating or investing in startups outside the key clusters could offer some advantages – fewer competitors for the regions talent and capital even if scarce means that you could attract more of them and there’s less threat of losing talent if there’s few other places for them to go further operating costs are lower – both people salaries and fixed costs rents etc are often far less expensive outside the clusters most of these other regions remain underappreciated and a local champion might get a reasonable cut of the “best” ideas in the smaller pond  but you’ll need to figure out how to evolve these businesses into global competitors over time – and one idea is to have a satellite office inside one of the major clusters to access the talent and capital advantages of those markets which we’ve done with numerous startups in the recent past like here the current trends around capital and talent flows strongly suggest that boston and the bay area will be the preeminent biotech clusters for the foreseeable future – and the global biotech startup scene needs to figure out how to adapt to that reality     this entry was posted in bioentrepreneurship biotech financing boston cluster talent and tagged biotech funding clusters bookmark the permalink ‹‹ previous post next post ›› leslie molony this clustering in two cities is not a great thing for innovation or for talent some of us do not wish to

comment we back ideas and discoveries from all over the globe so happy to connect with your regional faculty on great science building successful companies requires more than just great science though – talent capital culture environment all play into the mix stephen provost having recruited biotech management teams in both the clusters and the nonclusters our proudest was the arkansas search this is a daily convo i have my thoughts – cprit companies are islands right now texas hasn’t built a critical mass to start a tight community yet and since the cities are spread out it adds to that challenge – shaving  years off an exit could do with that fact that it’s easier to meet quickly in person at le meridien or the weston than getting on a flight to denverseattleaustin those smaller accessibility reasons can add up over time – ma will pull away with the lead soon from bay area based on cost of living i have senior management members tell me daily that they’ll move anywhere but bay area you’ll pay m for  br in palo alto south bay and north bay aren’t too much better – noncluster areas can work we’ve completed searches in  states in biotech like most things in this industry if the science is sound things always find a way of falling into place tim gallagher boston  sf surely are the top biotech clusters in the world but i’m wondering if this is an inevitable win for bossf simply through numbers or are the companies in the “key clusters” better eg if a given technology or startup or person has a higher ceiling or greater probability of success in boston or sf i think this article ably demonstrates the greater scale in the “key clusters” total nih funding greater valuation at exit etc and wants to deliver the ceilingprobability of success but i don’t see evidence of that yet yes key cluster companies are  years quicker to the public markets but i’m not sure that represents better companies rather than more financial engineering or more hype as an example consider the  boston crispr companies edit  ntla they’re superquick to the public markets which only could have happened in bossf but they are still fundamentally preclinical companies only in the “key clusters” do  preclinical companies have a collective b in market cap but  of this is cash on the balance sheet with very little news flow to come for years suggesting a lower truefuture valuation along with the inevitable trimming from platform company to a product company with  programs nearing ind might these companies have had a higher ceiling had they started as cashstarved startups in the hinterlands i also see that the megabiotechs were generally created outside the “key clusters” suggesting that what the hinterlands lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality working down the top holdings of ibb which list represents greater long term success bostonsf biogen vertex gilead incyte biomarin exelixis alnylam bluebird hinterlands amgen celgene regeneron alexion illumina shire ct qiagen seattle genetics jazz pharma tesoro united tx ionis acadia kite biotechne cellectis juno genmab morphosys galapagos up for debate alkermes halfbos half irl i recognize that this is a trailing indicator of key cluster growth it seems that the “key clusters” lead in numbers of companies and dealflow but not necessarily long term success another area to explore in another post is where the economic impact is generated as many wellfunded companies in the “key clusters” are  person virtual companies with operations contracted out to hinterlands cros like biocon india ppd inc pra quintiles all nc and covance various with manufacturing ultimately outsourced as well to patheondr reddy’sdsm in the hinterlands full disclosure i work in biotech economic development in a hinterland location alex whilst it is true that boston and san francisco are undeniably the homes of biotech i feel i should make an effort to stand up for europe and in particular london as a young scientist looking to work for a startup biotech i was spoilt for choice in many areas of research the company i am with now is one of the first on a large new site being developed for biotech research and translation the number and quality of nearby universities with a desire to foster new talent and feed innovation is ever growing  out the top  european universities plus the francis crick institute the wellcome trust etc proximity to both large pharma and the financial industry of london encourages collaboration and access to funding london has also been a talent draw in a similar way to the north american key clusters with a strong influx of great people from europe i can only hope that this remains so throughout and after brexit in the meantime i will continue to count cranes out of my lab window…i’ve got to  nathan w thanks for a wonderful blog i am a technology and patent analyst for an investment bank in dallas tx i have to agree with leslie on this one not everyone can afford to live in sf especially talented scientists coming from places like ut southwestern ut austin and washu the bay area doesn’t have a monopoly on talented scientists nor bostonthis trend sends a chilling effect on great scientists living outside of these hubs often forcing them to leave the profession i have been asked to do some advocacy work to promote biotech in dallas the goal with my presentation is to encourage local entrepreneurs and financiers to invest in texas startups that are spunoff from texas medical school and universities there have been over  biotech startups launched in the last  years in the dallas metroplex that have failed been boughtout or relocated to biotech hub cities like san francisco further we have some startups here with a bare bones headquarters in dallas but their main rd operations are located elsewhere why most of the companies from this list were spinoffs from local universities whose basic research was supported with local alumni and taxpayer money two of these companies were asked to relocate to hub cities at the request of an out of state vcs even though it would have been cheaper to have them here in dallas than sf  sq ft vs  sq ft office space plus salaries are higher due to the increase in the cost of living mostly housing these relocations of startups just the cost the vc and angel investors and their backing accredited investors more money and will result in a decrease roi even some cprit executives are encouraging the out of state relocation of spinoffs using tx tax dollars to create jobs in ca of note if one looks at migration patterns between tx and ca most people are leaving ca to move to tx due to lower taxes and a substantial decrease in housing costs so what are these vc investors thinking nicholas phillips great article but unless i missed it in the above text you did not mention infrastructure biotech requires hazardous waste removal special water companies that expertise building iso certified rooms etc since ca and ma both have this infrastructure they are more attractive for startups search search for subscribe by email this iframe contains the logic required to handle ajax
