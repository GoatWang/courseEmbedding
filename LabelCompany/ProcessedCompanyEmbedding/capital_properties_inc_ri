station associates et al richard g riendeau joseph s larisa jr philip w noel charles j mcgovern eugene coulter james r lee providence for defendant o p i n i o nthis case comes before us on an appeal by the state of rhode island state and the city of providence city from summary judgments entered in the superior court arising from four civil actions that were consolidated for trial before justice thomas h needham of the superior court   these cases involve separate but related disputes among the plaintiff capital properties inc cpi the state and the city   these disputes include the issues of payment by the state and the city of a condemnation award entered in the superior court in favor of cpi in which the fairmarket value of property condemned by the state for the providence river relocation project was set in the sum of    the disputes include a purported assessment by the city of taxes on other property owned by cpi in the capital center area based upon the valuation made by the superior court in the condemnation procedure   this reassessment of taxes covered a period for the years  to    the disputes also include a proceeding commenced by the providence redevelopment agency to condemn a parcel of real estate in the capital center area referred to in this litigation as parcel no  all these disputes were resolved by summary judgments entered in the superior courtthe state opposed the entry of summary judgment that required it to pay the entire balance of the condemnation award subject to reimbursement by the city for its  percent share and credit by cpi for a sum already paid by the state and also for reimbursement by cpi for the value of land parcel no  that the state had conveyed to cpi to pay the states share of the condemnation award   the city appealed from the summary judgments that enjoined the city from its purported retroactive tax increase and invalidated the purported condemnation of parcel no  and also appealed from the conditional summary judgment requiring the city to reimburse the state for  percent of the payment that the state would make to satisfy the condemnation awardwe are of the opinion that for the reasons stated in the opinion of justice needham the appeals by the state the city and the providence redevelopment agency  are without merit   we adopt the opinion of justice needham as our own but make the following modifications to the summary judgment entered in the superior court by reason of a waiver entered in open court by counsel for cpi the state shall not be required to pay its  percent share of the award to cpi since cpi acknowledges that it has already received full reimbursement for the states share by an earlier payment plus the conveyance of parcel no  from the state to cpi consequently the state shall pursuant to the summary judgment entered in the superior court pay to cpi within twenty days from the date of this opinion the  percent share of the condemnation award that was held in the superior court to be attributable to and ultimately payable by the city within twenty days of the date of the payment by the state of the share of the award attributable to the city the city shall pursuant to the conditional summary judgment entered in the superior court pay to the state complete reimbursement for the states payment to cpi of the citys share of the condemnation awardin all other respects the judgments entered by the superior court are affirmed and the appeals by the state and the city are denied and dismissed   the opinion of justice needham is appended hereto as exhibit a and made a part hereof   the papers in the case may be remanded to the superior court for issuance of execution on the summary judgments already rendered and for further proceedings relating

relief pursuant to the uniform declaratory judgment act rigl §  et seq concerning the contractual rights and obligations of the parties with respect to payment of the final judgment in ca no    the state has moved for summary judgment against cpi arguing that the state has already paid its contractual share of the final judgment   the state also has moved although reluctantly for “conditional” summary judgment against the city the state argues that the city not the state is contractually liable to pay cpi the remaining share of the final judgment   additionally the state argues the alternative that if this court determines the state is liable to pay cpi the final judgment then the city is contractually liable to the state for one half the final judgment   in response cpi has moved for summary judgment against the state arguing that the state not the city is the proper judgment debtor and is contractually obligated to pay the condemnation award   the city opposes the motions by the state and cpi arguing that the contract between the state and city is void and unenforceable for lack of city council authorization   the city also contests the jurisdiction of this court to hear this declaratory judgment complaint arguing that the state is not a proper party plaintiffadditionally cpi has moved for summary judgment against the city the city claims that the conveyance of certain property in the capital center district known as parcel  by the city to the state and subsequently the conveyance by the state to cpi is void   cpi argues that the city council of the city city council passed resolutions nos  and  authorizing the mayor to convey parcel  to the state and that the mayor did in fact convey this property by deed   the state then conveyed parcel  to cpiafter thorough examination of the evidence presented and factual proffers made by the parties the court finds the following undisputed facts   on january   cpi and the state signed an agreement cpistate agreement in settlement “of all outstanding problems between them relating to the river relocation․” paragraphs  and  provide in part that the “state will condemn the land of cpi necessary to accomplish the river relocation and construction of memorial boulevard․” cpi agreed to “dismiss with prejudice the suit filed against the state and the city ․ and to release the state and city from all liability relating to the river relocation ․  however this release shall not extend to condemnation payments under paragraphs  and  hereof”paragraph  referenced a separate agreement between the state and the city entitled providence river relocationmemorial boulevard extension project comprehensive agreement statecity agreement signed by the state and city on january   acknowledging that “the state and the city will be sharing the costs of condemnation referred to under paragraphs  and  hereof”   paragraph  also states in pertinent part that thestate hereby agrees to convey said parcel  to cpi as consideration for this conveyance ․ cpi will pay to the state a sum equal to the states share of the total condemnation proceeds awarded cpi under paragraphs  and  hereof   the balance of the condemnation proceeds shall remain the property of cpi no subsequent amendment of said agreement between the state and the city shall affect the rights of cpi under this paragraphfurthermore on january   the state and cpi signed a settlement agreement which was an agreement among the state city and cpi to settle claims in a lawsuit filed by cpi however the city did not sign this settlement agreement and paragraph  states in pertinent part that thisagreement will not become effective until it has been executed by all of the parties hereto․ the fact of the execution of this agreement by any of the parties hereto shall not be used as evidence against any such party in any legal proceedings involving the subject matter of this agreement unless and until this agreement has been executed by all three signatories․on march   the city council issued a resolution resolution of the city council no  authorizing the mayor “to execute an agreement ․ with the state ․ regarding the memorial boulevard extension project ․ setting forth the obligations of the city ․ concerning the relocation of the moshassuck and woonasquatucket rivers traffic improvement within that area and other matters relative to said property․”on january   the state and the city signed the statecity agreement which provided for the “relocation of the moshassuck and woonasquatucket rivers” and “extension of memorial boulevard” and set out “funding commitments” and “costsharing provisions”   section  responsibility for property acquisition subsection b provides that “the city and the state shall share equally in all costs and expenses not borne by a third party arising out of acquisition of such real property”   moreover section  payments by city subsection a states in pertinent part thatas provided in exhibit iv hereto the city has agreed to make payments in cash to the state of its financial obligations under this agreement as follows ․ iv at such time as may be required in the event that land acquisition costs exceed the estimates set forth for land acquisition in exhibits ii and iii a payment in an amount sufficient to satisfy the citys obligations under section bthe aforementioned exhibit iv is a preliminary agreement made between the state and city and a letter from the city to the state recognizing and incorporating the same both dated october     in paragraph  the letter states in pertinent part thatany and all cost overruns or short falls incurred or experienced with respect to any element of this project including but not limited to ․ land acquisition expenses and costs and any costs expenses fees awards judgments or settlements arising out of any litigation or threat of litigation relating to such elements shall be borne by the state and city in equal sharesmoreover the preliminary agreement section  funding allocation subsection c cost savings shortfalls states in pertinent part that thestate and the city hereby agree that ․ all cost savings achieved or cost overruns or shortfalls incurred or experienced with respect to any element of this project such saving or shortfall if not had or borne by a third party funding entity be had or borne by the state and the city in equal shareson november   the state condemned approximately two acres of property owned by cpi and paid cpi  the fair market value determined by the state   on july   the city transferred parcel  by deed to the state  the deed was signed by the mayor and approved by the city solicitor   on september   the state conveyed parcel  to cpi on september   the city council issued resolution no  acknowledging the authority of the mayor pursuant to resolution no  to execute an agreement with the state regarding the providence river relocation project   the city council also authorized the mayor to convey to the state parcel  and recognized that the city was authorized to make such conveyance pursuant to rigl §  the city council expressly “ratified confirmed and approved” this conveyance of real property to the statec ca nos  and   reassessment of back taxesin another matter of this litigation on august   and on october   cpi filed ca nos  and  respectively seeking equitable relief against the city under rigl §§  and    cpi asserts that the city violated rigl §§   and   and  by revaluing and reassessing cpis real property in the capital center district  property for years  to  and  and retroactively applying a property tax and accrued interest based upon the  per square foot real property fair market value determination in ca no    cpi has moved for summary judgment   the city has opposed this motion arguing that cpis property in the capital center district was erroneously assessed with a lower value than the fair market value determined by the court in the above condemnation proceeding and asserts that cpi is judicially estopped from asserting that its other property has a lower fair market value per square foot   the city also has made a motion to sever the assessment for year  from the reassessment for years  to    additionally in order to collect the alleged back taxes and accrued interest owed by cpi the city has given cpi tax sale notices dated january   that state in pertinent part “the real estate in the city   assessed in your name on december   and prior will be offered for tax sale at public auction on june  ”after thorough examination of the evidence presented and factual proffers made by the parties the court finds the following undisputed facts   a general revaluation of all real property located in the city was conducted as of december   by the saber system company   the saber system company developed a statistical computer model utilizing “pricing keys” to produce a fair and equitable valuation of all real property located in the city on or about august   cpi received tax bills from the city for taxes assessed on cpis property as of december     these tax bills reflected a remarkable increase in the valuations of the property  the city essentially revalued cpis property solely based upon the  per square foot condemnation value determined by the court in ca no    it is undisputed that after the tax assessor learned of this determination he “felt compelled” to raise the valuations of cpis other property to this level   the tax assessor reasoned that the previous valuations must have been “erroneous” because the superior court determined a condemnation fair market value per square foot that was greater than the assessed values of other property located in the capital center districton or about august   the city mailed additional tax bills to cpi the city retroactively applied the real property valuations made in  to taxes assessed for years  to  and assessed back taxes and accrued interest   moreover these same reassessment values were carried forward to the real property assessment as of december     there is no dispute between the parties that cpi has paid all taxes due on the property up to and including taxes assessed as of december  d ca no   condemnation of parcel on december   cpi filed ca no  alleging violation of the redevelopment act of  title  chapters  to  redevelopment act in opposing the condemnation of parcel  by the city cpi moves for summary judgment arguing that parcel  is not a blighted and substandard area as defined by the redevelopment act and that the city council did not make the required findings of fact to support condemnation of parcel  the city argues that the above motion is not proper as there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute concerning the development of parcel  the city asserts summarily with no supporting documentation that the facts concerning the development of parcel  are in dispute as the factual findings of the city council disagree with the factual proffers made by cpiafter thorough examination of the facts proffered and consideration of the arguments presented in memoranda this court makes the following undisputed findings   in august  the providence redevelopment agency pra submitted to the city council an ordinance to amend the official redevelopment plan for downtown providence renewal amendment   this amendment authorizes the pra to condemn parcel  and a portion of parcel    the pra submitted a written report with the amendment   this report made “findings as to dangers from arrested development” and states in pertinent part at page  thatpursuant to rigl sec  it is hereby established that the properties proposed to be acquired within both parcels  and  are found to be arrested and that the vacant lots contribute to the substandard conditions in the areaparcel  is a more precarious position than any other parcel in capital center   its location is the gateway to downtown  it is positioned at the crossroads of memorial boulevard i and francis street   its lack of development proposals is surprising given that this premier site will command views of waterplace park the state house college hill and downtown   a vacant parcel in such close proximity to waterplace park hinders access to the park and retards further development around waterplace parkon or about september   the city council referred the amendment to the committee on urban redevelopment renewal and planning committee   on september   the committee held a hearing concerning the amendment and development of parcel  during this hearing cpi represented that it had secured a letter of intent for the “substantial” development of parcel  cpi also represented that it “anticipates” the execution of a “definitive lease agreement shortly”   however on november   and december   the amendment was read and passed in the city council   the mayor of the city mayor signed the amendment on december  on december   cpi entered into a one hundred and fortynine year lease agreement with fc acquisition associates llc fc associates a national real estate company and an affiliate of forest city enterprises inc for the development of parcel  under this lease agreement fc associates is required to construct a building with at least three hundred and fifty thousand square feet of commercial space with a minimum of two hundred parking spaces   this court takes notice that most recently in an article entitled “developer plans retail complex at cap center” the providence journal newspaper outlined this development project as a “million sixstory retail development” that “would feature record and book stores and other entertainment offerings on the first floor more traditional retail outlets above and parking space for  cars atop the structure”   see bob wyss developer plans retail complex at cap center the providence journal march   also available at wwwprojocom reportpjb stories htm additionally the mayor in publicly “announcing the new development” is quoted by the providence journal as saying parcel  is “probably one of the most prominent addresses in the city of providence”   id these facts are not disputed by the cityhowever the city does dispute as a genuine issue of material fact the ownership of parcel  as stated above in ca no  on july   the city transferred parcel  by deed to the state and on september   the state conveyed parcel  to cpi as part of an agreement between the state and cpi approximately from september  to december  cpi permitted the state to use parcel  for the storage of large granite blocks that were used to construct the providence river relocation project   in exchange for the use of parcel  the state agreed to pay the real estate taxes of parcel  due to the city summary judgment review “summary judgment is a proceeding in which the proponent must demonstrate ․ that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that there are no genuine issues of material fact”   palmisciano v burrillville racing association  ad   ri citing steinberg v state  ad  ri  ludwig v kowal  ad  ri  superctrcivp rule c   during a summary judgment proceeding “the court does not pass upon the weight or credibility of the evidence but must consider the affidavits and other pleadings in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion”  id citing lennon v macgregor  ad  ri   moreover “the trial justice must look for factual issues not determine them the justices only function is

party plaintiff to seek relief pursuant to rigl §  the city argues that the uniform declaratory judgment act act does not confer jurisdiction upon this court to hear a complaint brought by the state   relying on rhode island turnpike and bridge authority v nugent  ri   ad   the city asserts that the state is not a “person” as defined by rigl §  and thus cannot seek relief under the act “obviously state officials are literally persons   but a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the officials office   as such it is no different from suit against the state itself”   will v michigan  us    sct    ledd   citations omitted   this court agrees with the city that under the general rules of statutory construction “neither the state nor its officials acting in their official capacities are ‘persons ” included in the definition of “persons” as defined in rigl §   id however rigl §  does not limit declaratory relief to “persons” as defined by the act the term “person” is used in rigl §§  “power to construe”  construction of contracts” and  “fiduciaries and other persons entitled to declaration of rights”   the legislature recognized that the “enumerations” contained in the above sections “do not limit or restrict the exercise of the general powers conferred in rigl §  in any proceeding where declaratory relief is sought in which a judgment or decree will terminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty”   rigl §    this court finds that a declaratory determination of the contractual obligations of the parties will terminate this aspect of the controversy   moreover our supreme court recognized in rhode island turnpike and bridge authority v nugent  ri at   ad at  that the state may consent to be sued and thus waive any sovereign immunity from judicial review under the act additionally “it has been determined that public officers are entitled to have their legal duties determined judicially by action for declaratory judgment   i anderson declaratory judgments  sec  p    and it has stated that the ‘state itself and its political subdivisions ․ are proper parties plaintiff’ ” borchard declaratory judgments  pp ”  abbott v beth israel cemetery assn  nj   ad    citations omitted   this court concludes that the state has brought this action under the act and thus has waived sovereign immunity   therefore this court has jurisdiction to decide this matter pursuant to rigl §  state is contractually bound to pay the final judgment to cpi this jurisdiction has “long   held that ‘parties are bound by the plain terms of their contract’ ”  vincent co v first nat supermarkets inc  ad   ri quoting hiller v submarine signal co  mass    ned     “the main objective of the court when construing contract terms is to determine the intent of the parties”  johnson v western nat life ins co  ad   ri citations omitted   the court will enforce the intentions of the parties as manifested in the terms of the contract if those “intentions can be clearly inferred from the contract terms and can be fairly carried out consistent with settled rules of law”  hill v ms alper  son inc  ri    ad    citations omitted   moreover the court “must find that a contract is ambiguous before it can exercise judicial construction of the document   if the court finds that the terms of an agreement are clear and unambiguous the task of judicial construction is at an end and the agreement must be applied as written”   wp associates v forcier inc  ad   riafter review of the facts and consideration of the arguments presented this court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute between the parties   from thorough consideration of the cpistate agreement the preliminary agreement and the statecity agreement and after giving the “word their plain ordinary and usual meaning” the court finds that the relevant terms and provisions of the these agreements are clear and unambiguous  johnson v western nat life ins  ad at    paragraph  of the cpistate agreement clearly states that “cpi will pay to the state a sum equal to the states share of the total condemnation proceeds awarded cpi․ the balance of the condemnation proceeds shall remain the property of cpi” in order for cpi to pay the state a portion of the total condemnation proceeds awarded in the final judgment and retain the balance cpi must first receive payment of the final judgment from the state   although the cpistate agreement contemplated that “the state and the city will be sharing the costs of condemnation ․” this language does not release the state from paying the final judgment to cpi the cpistate agreement specifically states that “this release shall not extend to condemnation payments under paragraphs  and  hereof”   the final judgment for condemnation damages was awarded to cpi against the state and only the state   the court concludes that the state is the judgment debtor and cpi has a clear legal right to payment by the state   the state has not submitted sufficient evidence for this court to find that it is has any contractual defenses to the execution of the writ of mandamus   after thorough consideration of the above findings of fact and conclusions of law this court concludes that the writ of mandamus issued in the decision by justice dominic f cresto no pc  supra is proper and should so issue   therefore this court denies the states motion for summary judgment with prejudice and grants the motion for summary judgment filed by cpi the city owes the state one half the final judgment “contracts with municipalities are measured by the same tests and are subject to the same rights and liabilities as are other contracts”  city of warwick v boeng corp  ad   ri citing  mcquillin municipal corporations §  at  d rev ed   from the undisputed facts this court finds that a valid contract was executed between the state and the city the city claims however that the statecity agreement is void and unenforceable for lack of city council authorization   to conclude whether the statecity agreement is void this court must first determine  whether the city was “acting within its general corporate powers but the particular act is void on account of some defect in the execution of the power” or  whether the citys “act in question is void because it is entirely beyond its corporate powers under any circumstances”  newport hospital v ward  a    ri      although the city does not make this distinction in their argument this determination is significant because “in cases of the former class the municipality is generally held liable for such benefits as it may have received in the course of the transaction while in cases of the latter class no recovery is permitted from the municipality for the value of the benefits received”  id citations omittedour supreme court has recognized that “a city may enter into contracts in aid of the performance of its public duties” xavier v cianci  ad   ri citing  mcquillin municipal corporations §  at  d ed and “a party who has received the benefit of the performance of a contract will not be permitted to deny his or her obligations unless paramount public interest requires”  city of warwick v boeng corp  ad at    the city has not submitted any genuine issue of material fact concerning the validity or enforceability of either the preliminary agreement or the statecity agreement   the city has neither proffered facts to dispute that the city council in issuing resolution no  authorized the mayor “to execute an agreement ․ with the state ․ regarding the memorial boulevard extension project” nor presented argument that mayors actions of executing the preliminary agreement and statecity agreement are ultra vires and not within the general corporate powers of the city from the undisputed facts presented this court finds that the mayor first executed the preliminary agreement and then executed the statecity agreement   after thorough review of these writings this court finds that the relevant terms and provisions of these writings are clear and unambiguous and are not in conflict with each other   this court concludes that the city council in issuing resolution nos  and  expressly authorized the mayor to execute these agreements and that the city council officially ratified the actions of the mayor by issuing these resolutions   specifically in resolution no  the city council acknowledged and ratified the actual authority of the mayor to execute such agreements pursuant to resolution no moreover the city neither proffers facts nor makes any argument that it has contested the validity and enforceability of the preliminary agreement and statecity agreement prior to being confronted with the potential liability of paying its share of the final judgment   this court notes that from the time the mayor executed these agreements until the start of this litigation the city has received many benefits from the substantial commercial and infrastructure development in the city associated with the preliminary agreement the statecity agreement and the providence river relocation project   the court finds that in receiving these benefits while maintaining its silence the city namely the city council has ratified the preliminary agreement and the statecity agreement   moreover the actions by the city council in issuing resolutions nos  and  and the inaction by the city council in maintaining silence while receiving substantial benefits from these two agreements with the state illustrate to this court that the mayor had the requisite actual authority from the city council to execute such agreements on behalf of the city see school committee of city of providence v board of regents for ed  ad   ri the “authority of a public agent to bind a municipality must be actual”the determination of this court interpreting the cpistate agreement that the state is contractually bound to pay cpi the final judgment additionally is supported by the statecity agreement   the parties do not dispute the documentary evidence illustrating that the state and the city agreed to share equally the “land acquisition expenses” and payment of “judgments” incurred by the state “arising out of any litigation․” specifically the statecity agreement section  subsection a states that “the city agreed to make payments in cash to the state of its financial obligations”  emphasis added   the states argument that the city is contractually obligated to pay onehalf the final judgment to cpi is not supported by the clear and unambiguous language of the statecity agreement   final judgment has been entered in ca no  and despite the states contrary position the court finds that the city is contractually obligated to pay the state its onehalf share of this amount   therefore the court grants the ‘conditional’ motion for summary judgment by the state against the city and upon subsequent “supplementary proceedings” before this court the court will grant the state affirmative relief against the city in accordance herewith cpi is the owner in fee of parcel  the city has presented no genuine issues of material fact that the conveyance of parcel  from the city to the state is void   it is undisputed that the city council issued resolution nos  and  approving the preliminary agreement and statecity agreement and thus the conveyance of parcel  to the state   moreover from the clear and unambiguous language contained in resolution no  this court finds that the city council “authorized the mayor to convey to the state ․ said parcel ․” the city council also recognized in resolution no  the general corporate authority of the city to convey parcel  pursuant to rigl §  and then “ratified confirmed and approved” said conveyance to the state   the city presents neither sufficient facts nor argument that the conveyance of parcel  does not come within the corporate authority of the city pursuant to rigl §  the court also finds that the city has neither presented sufficient facts nor argument for this court to conclude that the action of the city in conveying parcel  to the state was ultra vires   the court concludes that the city council authorized the mayor to convey parcel  to the state and officially “ratified confirmed and approved” said conveyance of real property   moreover this court finds that the state then conveyed parcel  to cpi and concludes that cpi is the owner in fee of parcel  therefore the motion for summary judgment by cpi against the city is grantedb ca no  and   reassessment of back taxes standard of review “the relief which the legislature provided for in rigl

 see also picerne v diprete  ad  ri   it is not “illegal per se or violative of constitutional uniformity or equalprotection provisions” when the tax authorities correct “past inequities without a general revaluation․ but when the tax authorities act out of improper or discriminatory motives the legitimacy of the revaluation process ends”  id at    the “appropriate” remedy to cure this violation is for the trial justice to “order  the defendants to expunge the   reassessments and permanently enjoin  the defendants from collecting taxes based on these reassessments”  id at  citations

but valuation alone is not the assessment but instead only its most important element’    cooley the law of taxation §  at  th ed   ․ the term ‘assessment’ as used in our taxing statutes carries with it a variety of meanings and noting also the statutory language before us to wit ‘any person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes ․’ we have no hesitancy in holding that within the context of rigl §  the term ‘assessment’ refers to the entire plan or statutory scheme for the imposition and collection of taxes including the calculation of the ratemaggiacomo v

used”  inn group associates v booth  ad   ri the complaint filed by cpi is proper the city argues that cpi must file a complaint for each of the tax years cpi is contesting the reassessment and imposition of back taxes and accrued interest   this court does not agree   generally “a taxpayer who challenges an assessment must file a complaint for each tax year that an assessment is under challenge”  mckee v bouchard  ad   ri citing northgate associates v shorey  ad  ri   however our supreme court has recognized that a plaintiff is not required “to relitigate annually the issue of fair market value” once this court has found an assessment to be invalid  ferland corp v bouchard  ad   ri citing rhode island student loan authority v nels inc  ad   ri   the city conducted a tax assessment and retroactive reassessment in  and a tax assessment in  of cpis properties   the matter before the court is whether the tax assessment of cpis real property and retrospective application thereof utilizing the fair market value per square foot determined by the superior court in ca no  violates the general laws once this court determines this issue there will be no need for cpi to file a separate complaint for each tax year it is contesting as any ruling the court makes will apply to all tax years in question  ferland corp v bouchard supra   therefore from the above findings of fact and conclusions of law this court denies the citys motion to sever the tax reassessments by the city are selective arbitrary and illegal after review of the factual proffers and arguments made by counsel this court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute between the parties   in the absence of precedential decisions on a particular matter the court may look to the cases from other jurisdictions which have considered the issue  merlino v tax assessors for the town of north providence  ri    ad    footnote omitted   as counsel for cpi has argued other courts have determined that the term “omitted property” as applied in the tax statutes means property that the tax assessor has not assessed at all and does not mean property that the tax assessor has undervalued  hunt v dist of columbia  fd   dccir  see also dist of columbia v casino assocs ltd  ad  dc  enterprise prods co v bd of supervisors  sod     additionally the term “erroneous assessment” is defined as “an assessment that deviates from the law and is therefore invalid and is a defect that is jurisdictional in its nature and does not refer to the judgment of the assessing officer in fixing the amount of valuation of the property”   blacks law dictionary th ed citing in re blatt  nm   pd     see also rosewell v bulk terminals co  illappd   illdec   ned  the city reassessed and imposed back taxes and accrued interest on cpis property solely based upon the condemnation value of one other piece of real property as determined by the superior court in a condemnation action   this fact is not disputed by the evidentiary proffers made by the parties   the city valuing real property for tax assessment purposes lower than the fair market value of other real property as later determined by the superior court in a future condemnation proceeding does not qualify as an “omitted” or “erroneous” assessment as required by the statute   this court concludes that the tax assessments were neither “omitted in the assessment” nor “erroneously assessed” to comply with the requirements of rigl §  moreover this court finds the tax assessments made by the city against cpi to be selective arbitrary and illegal   from the factual proffers provided by the parties the court concludes that the city intended to revalue only cpis property in the capital center district  the tax assessments and reassessments were not made by the tax assessor as part of a “definite and logical plan for all properties in the” city but rather were based upon the fair market value of different real property in the capital center district as determined by the superior court in a condemnation proceeding  see picerne v diprete  ad at    the citys real property valuation method of utilizing the fair market value of real property as determined by the superior court in a condemnation proceeding to determine the fair market value of other real property for tax assessment and reassessment purposes is selective arbitrary and illegal   therefore this court grants the motion for summary judgment filed by cpi against the city this court hereby orders the city to expunge all real property tax assessments and reassessments based upon the  per square foot fair market value as determined in the condemnation proceeding above and permanently enjoins the city from collecting taxes and accrued interest based upon this assessment and reassessment valuation method  idc ca no   condemnation of parcel  standard to condemn real property the purpose of the redevelopment act is the “elimination and prevention of blighted and substandard areas and their replacement through redevelopment by wellplanned integrated stable safe and healthful neighborhoods․” rigl §    an arrested blighted area is defined as “an area which by reason of the existence of physical conditions ․ is unduly costly to develop soundly through the ordinary operations of private enterprise and impairs the sound growth of the community”   rigl §    this court is “conscious ․ of the extreme grant of power now resting in the hands of various redevelopment agencies ․ and that a showing that a redevelopment agency has exceeded its delegated authority by an arbitrary capricious or bad faith taking of private property is a matter properly cognizable by the judicial branch”  romeo v cranston redevelopment agency  ri    ad    citations omitted   additionally pursuant to rigl §  the pra and subsequently the city council in adopting the ordinance was required to make “findings that the project area is blighted and substandard and requires ․ redevelopment” condemnation of parcel  violates the redevelopment act cpi has proffered undisputed facts that parcel  is scheduled for “substantial” commercial development which will benefit the local community the city and the state   at the september   hearing before the committee cpi made this fact known to the city however with the knowledge that cpi would execute a “definitive lease agreement” for parcel  with a real estate developer the city council adopted and the mayor signed the ordinance condemning parcel  neither the pra nor the city council made the requisite findings of fact to support a conclusion that parcel  is a “blighted and substandard area” and “requires” redevelopment by the city see rigl §    after consideration of the undisputed factual proffers made by the parties this court concludes that this act by the city council and the mayor was arbitrary capricious and done in bad faith   moreover this court takes notice that as the city contests this summary judgment motion arguing to this court that there are disputed facts whether cpi is developing parcel  the mayor was very willing to announce publicly the commercial development of parcel  and to unveil an “artists rendering of the project”   bob wyss developer plan retail complex at cap center the providence journal supra   therefore this court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to the condemnation of parcel  by the pra and the city council and hereby grants the motion for summary judgment filed by cpiconclusionthe supreme court deferred consideration of no appeal and “remanded that case to this court with the direction to consolidate hear and decide” all unresolved claims and defenses among the parties   see appendix a pursuant to the remand order issued in that appeal this court has consolidated heard and decided the above case actions   the parties have submitted various summary judgment motions and accompanying memoranda of law   after thorough review of the factual proffers made and consideration of the memoranda of law submitted by the parties this court finds in each case action that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute between the parties   this court provided all parties with an equal and more than ample opportunity to comply with the above supreme court order   the court granted a flexible and lengthy briefing schedule for the parties to submit memoranda and supplementary memoranda of law and to provide accompanying evidentiary proffers in order to ensure that this court have before it all unresolved claims and defenses and to ensure for each party a full opportunity to be heard by this court   although the parties did not present oral arguments concerning the above matters this court concludes that the rights of the parties were not prejudiced as the aforesaid briefing schedule ensured that each party had an equal and more than ample opportunity to proffer facts and make arguments of law before this courtafter filing this decision with the clerk of the superior court this court sua sponte will enter the appropriate judgments in accordance herewith for the above case actions and shall submit all case files herein to the supreme court forthwith   this court takes notice that these case actions are proceeding directly to the supreme court and that the appeal procedures under our general laws and civil rules for the parties to seek review of this decision by our supreme court have been stayed   after thoughtful consideration this court concludes that neither the appeal rights nor the constitutional rights of the parties have been substantially prejudiced   the appeal rights of the parties are preserved so this procedural irregularity does not prevent any party from appealing either this decision or the judgments contained herein to our supreme court   this court orders that the above matters which have been consolidated heard and decided before this court as so ordered by our supreme court shall remain consolidated and shall proceed to the supreme court without further delayfootnotes   the providence redevelopment agency was involved

of the state pursuant to this agreement to pay either cpi or the city the claimed amounts for reassessed back taxes and accrued interest   the court notes that other owners of real property located in the capital center district also may have been assessed real estate taxes solely based upon the  per square foot fair market value determination of the superior court  however the parties do not present sufficient facts to support such a conclusion   this court concludes that such factual proffers would not change the legal determinations contained herein   the issue before the court is not whether the tax assessor calculated the proper fair market value of cpis real property in the capital center district but whether the tax assessors valuation methodthe fair market value for condemnation of other real property as determined by the superior courtfor reassessing real property that the city already had assessed is proper   this court distinguishes the present issue from that presented by the parties in nos ltd partnership v booth  ad  ri   the case action between cpi and the city is not a dispute over the fair market value of the individual properties   in fact the city has not “assessed” the fair market value of cpis properties utilizing a recognized valuation model to produce a fair and equitable valuation of all real property located in the city this court doubts that if the superior court in the condemnation proceeding above determined a fair market value per square foot less than the assessed values of real property in the capital center district that the city would have “felt compelled” to issue a tax refund and pay accrued interest to cpi for overpayment of taxes during the prior six yearsweisberger chief justice findlaw career center attorney
