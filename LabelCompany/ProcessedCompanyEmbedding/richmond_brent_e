states us supreme court richmond v j a croson co richmond v j a croson co resetaa font size print united states supreme court richmond v j a croson co  no  argued october      decided january   appellant city adopted a minority business utilization plan plan requiring prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least  of the dollar amount of each contract to one or more minority business enterprises mbes which the plan defined to include a business from anywhere in the country at least  of which is owned and controlled by black spanishspeaking oriental indian eskimo or aleut citizens although the plan declared that it was remedial in nature it was adopted after a public hearing at which no direct evidence was presented that the city had discriminated on the basis of race in letting contracts or that its prime contractors had discriminated against minority subcontractors the evidence that was introduced included a statistical study indicating that although the citys population was  black only  of its prime construction contracts had been awarded to minority businesses in recent years figures establishing that a variety of local contractors associations had virtually no mbe members the citys counsels conclusion that the plan was constitutional under fullilove v klutznick  us   and the statements of plan proponents indicating that there had been widespread racial discrimination in the local state and national construction industries pursuant to the plan the city adopted rules requiring individualized consideration of each bid or request for a waiver of the  setaside and providing that a waiver could be granted only upon proof that sufficient qualified mbes were unavailable or unwilling to participate after appellee construction company the sole bidder on a city contract was denied a waiver and lost its contract it brought suit under  usc  alleging that the plan was unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause the federal district court upheld the plan in all respects and the court of appeals affirmed applying a test derived from the principal opinion in fullilove supra which accorded great deference to congress findings of past societal discrimination in holding that a  minority setaside for certain federal construction grants did not violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment however on appellees petition for certiorari in this case this court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of its intervening decision in wygant v jackson board of education  us   in  us     which the plurality applied a strict scrutiny standard in holding that a racebased layoff program agreed to by a school board and the local teachers union violated the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause on remand the court of appeals held that the citys plan violated both prongs of strict scrutiny in that  the plan was not justified by a compelling governmental interest since the record revealed no prior discrimination by the city itself in awarding contracts and  the  setaside was not narrowly tailored to accomplish a remedial purpose held the judgment is affirmed  fd  affirmed justice oconnor delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i iiib and iv concluding that  the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling governmental interest justifying the plan since the factual predicate supporting the plan does not establish the type of identified past discrimination in the citys construction industry that would authorize racebased relief under the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause pp  a a generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in the entire construction industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota since it provides no guidance for the citys legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy and would allow racebased decisionmaking essentially limitless in scope and duration the citys argument that it is attempting to remedy various forms of past societal discrimination that are alleged to be responsible for the small number of minority entrepreneurs in the local contracting industry fails since the city also lists a host of nonracial factors which would seem to face a member of any racial group seeking to establish a new business enterprise such as deficiencies in working capital inability to meet bonding requirements unfamiliarity with bidding procedures and disability caused by an inadequate track record pp  b none of the facts cited by the city or relied on by the district court singly or together provide a basis for a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by anyone in the citys construction industry the fact that the plan declares itself to be remedial is insufficient since the mere recitation of a benign or legitimate purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no weight similarly the views of plan proponents as to past and present discrimination in the industry are highly conclusory and of little probative value reliance on the disparity between the number of prime contracts awarded to minority businesses and the citys minority population is also misplaced since the proper statistical evaluation would compare the percentage of mbes  us     in the relevant market that are qualified to undertake city subcontracting work with the percentage of total city construction dollars that are presently awarded to minority subcontractors neither of which is known to the city the fact that mbe membership in local contractors associations was extremely low is also not probative absent some link to the number of mbes eligible for membership since there are numerous explanations for the dearth of minority participation including past societal discrimination in education and economic opportunities as well as both black and white career and entrepreneurial choices congress finding in connection with the setaside approved in fullilove that there had been nationwide discrimination in the construction industry also has extremely limited probative value since by including a waiver procedure in the national program congress explicitly recognized that the scope of the problem would vary from market area to market area in any event congress was acting pursuant to its unique enforcement powers under  of the fourteenth amendment pp  c the evidence relied upon by justice marshalls dissent  the citys history of school desegregation and numerous congressional reports  does little to define the scope of any injury to minority contractors in the city or the necessary remedy and could justify a preference of any size or duration moreover justice marshalls suggestion that discrimination findings may be shared from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is unprecedented and contrary to this courts decisions pp  d since there is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against spanishspeaking oriental indian eskimo or aleut persons in any aspect of the citys construction industry the plans random inclusion of those groups strongly impugns the citys claim of remedial motivation p   the plan is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination since it entitles a black hispanic or oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country to an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race although many of the barriers to minority participation in the construction industry relied upon by the city to justify the plan appear to be race neutral there is no evidence that the city considered using alternative raceneutral means to increase minority participation in city contracting moreover the plans rigid  quota rests upon the completely unrealistic assumption that minorities will choose to enter construction in lockstep proportion to their representation in the local population unlike the program upheld in fullilove the plans waiver system focuses upon the availability of mbes and does not inquire whether the particular mbe seeking a racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors given the fact that the city must already consider bids and  us     waivers on a casebycase basis the citys only interest in maintaining a quota system rather than investigating the need for remedial action in particular cases would seem to be simply administrative convenience which standing alone cannot justify the use of a suspect classification under equal protection strict scrutiny pp  justice oconnor joined by the chief justice and justice white concluded in part ii that if the city could identify past discrimination in the local construction industry with the particularity required by the equal protection clause it would have the power to adopt racebased legislation designed to eradicate the effects of that discrimination the principal opinion in fullilove cannot be read to relieve the city of the necessity of making the specific findings of discrimination required by the clause since the congressional finding of past discrimination relied on in that case was made pursuant to congress unique power under  of the amendment to enforce and therefore to identify and redress violations of the amendments provisions conversely  of the amendment which includes the equal protection clause is an explicit constraint upon the power of states and political subdivisions which must undertake any remedial efforts in accordance with the dictates of that section however the court of appeals erred to the extent that it followed by rote the wygant pluralitys ruling that the equal protection clause requires a showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved since that ruling was made in the context of a racebased policy that affected the particular public employers own work force whereas this case involves a state entity which has specific statelaw authority to address discriminatory practices within local commerce under its jurisdiction pp  justice oconnor joined by the chief justice justice white and justice kennedy concluded in parts iiia and v that  since the plan denies certain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely on their race wygants strict scrutiny standard of review must be applied which requires a firm evidentiary basis for concluding that the underrepresentation of minorities is a product of past discrimination application of that standard which is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by the racial classification assures that the city is pursuing a remedial goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool and that the means chosen fit this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype the relaxed standard of review proposed by justice marshalls dissent does not provide a means for determining that a racial classification is in fact designed to further remedial goals since it accepts the remedial nature of the classification  us     before examination of the factual basis for the classifications enactment and the nexus between its scope and that factual basis even if the level of equal protection scrutiny could be said to vary according to the ability of different groups to defend their interests in the representative process heightened scrutiny would still be appropriate in the circumstances of this case since blacks constitute approximately  of the citys population and hold five of nine seats on the city council thereby raising the concern that the political majority may have acted to disadvantage a minority based on unwarranted assumptions or incomplete facts pp   even in the absence of evidence of discrimination in the local construction industry the city has at its disposal an array of raceneutral devices to increase the accessibility of city contracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races who have suffered the effects of past societal discrimination including simplification of bidding procedures relaxation of bonding requirements training financial aid elimination or modification of formal barriers caused by bureaucratic inertia and the prohibition of discrimination in the provision of credit or bonding by local suppliers and banks pp  justice stevens although agreeing that the plan cannot be justified as a remedy for past discrimination concluded that the fourteenth amendment does not limit permissible racial classifications to those that remedy past wrongs but requires that racebased governmental decisions be evaluated primarily by studying their probable impact on the future pp  a disregarding the past history of racial injustice there is not even an arguable basis for suggesting that the race of a subcontractor or contractor on city projects should have any relevance to his or her access to the market although race is not always irrelevant to sound governmental decisionmaking the city makes no claim that the public interest in the efficient performance of its construction contracts will be served by granting a preference to minoritybusiness enterprises pp  b legislative bodies such as the city council which are primarily policymaking entities that promulgate rules to govern future conduct raise valid constitutional concerns when they use the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of private citizens courts on the other hand are well equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed and should have the same broad discretion in racial discrimination cases that chancellors enjoy in other areas of the law to fashion remedies against persons who have been proved guilty of violations of law pp   us     c rather than engaging in debate over the proper standard of review to apply in affirmativeaction litigation it is more constructive to try to identify the characteristics of the advantaged and disadvantaged classes that may justify their disparate treatment here instead of carefully identifying those characteristics the city has merely engaged in the type of stereotypical analysis that is the hallmark of equal protection clause violations the class of persons benefited by the plan is not limited to victims of past discrimination by white contractors in the city but encompasses persons who have never been in business in the city minority contractors who may have themselves been guilty of discrimination against other minority group members and firms that have prospered notwithstanding discriminatory treatment similarly although the plan unquestionably disadvantages some white contractors who are guilty of past discrimination against blacks it also punishes some who discriminated only before it was forbidden by law and some who have never discriminated against anyone pp  justice kennedy concluded that the fourteenth amendment ought not to be interpreted to reduce a states power to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects in both the public and private sectors or its absolute duty to do so where those wrongs were caused intentionally by the state itself except where there is a conflict with federal law or where as here a state remedy itself violates equal protection although a rule striking down all racial preferences which are not necessary remedies to victims of unlawful discrimination would serve important structural goals by eliminating the necessity for courts to pass on each such preference that is enacted that rule would be a significant break with this courts precedents that require a casebycase test and need not be adopted rather it may be assumed that the principle of race neutrality found in the equal protection clause will be vindicated by the less absolute strict scrutiny standard the application of which demonstrates that the citys plan is not a remedy but is itself an unconstitutional preference pp  justice scalia agreeing that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental racial classifications concluded that  the fourteenth amendment prohibits state and local governments from discriminating on the basis of race in order to undo the effects of past discrimination except in one circumstance where that is necessary to eliminate their own maintenance of a system of unlawful racial classification moreover the states remedial power in that instance extends no further than the scope of the constitutional violation and does not encompass the continuing effects of a discriminatory system once the system itself has been eliminated pp   us      the state remains free to undo the effects of past discrimination in permissible ways that do not involve classification by race  for example by according a contracting preference to small or new businesses or to actual victims of discrimination who can be identified in the latter instance the classification would not be based on race but on the fact that the victims were wronged pp  oconnor j announced the

fd  ca  appeal docketed no  associated general contractors of cal v city and cty of san francisco  fd  ca  we noted probable jurisdiction in this case to consider the applicability of our decision in wygant to a minority setaside program adopted by the city of richmond virginia i on april   the richmond city council adopted the minority business utilization plan the plan the plan required prime contractors to whom the city awarded construction contracts to subcontract at least  of the dollar amount of the contract to one or more minority business enterprises mbes ordinance no  codified in richmond va city code a  the  setaside  us     did not apply to city contracts awarded to minorityowned prime contractors ibid the plan defined an mbe as a business at least fiftyone  percent of which is owned and controlled    by minority group members  p  minority group members were defined as citizens of the united states who are blacks spanishspeaking orientals indians eskimos or aleuts ibid there was no geographic limit to the plan an otherwise qualified mbe from anywhere in the united states could avail itself of the  setaside the plan declared that it was remedial in nature and enacted for the purpose of promoting wider participation by minority business enterprises in the construction of public projects a the plan expired on june   and was in effect for approximately five years ibid    the plan authorized the director of the department of general services to promulgate rules which shall allow waivers in those individual situations where a contractor can prove to the satisfaction of the director that the requirements herein cannot be achieved  to this end the director promulgated contract clauses minority business utilization plan contract clauses paragraph d of these rules provided no partial or complete waiver of the foregoing  setaside requirement shall be granted by the city other than in exceptional circumstances to justify a waiver it must be shown that every feasible attempt has been made to comply and it must be demonstrated that sufficient relevant qualified minority business enterprises    are unavailable or unwilling to participate in the  us     contract to enable meeting the  mbe goal § d record exh  p  see j a croson co v richmond  fd   ca  croson i the director also promulgated purchasing procedures to be followed in the letting of city contracts in accordance with the plan id at  bidders on city construction contracts were provided with a minority business utilization plan commitment form record exh  p  within  days of the opening of the bids the lowest otherwise responsive bidder was required to submit a commitment form naming the mbes to be used on the contract and the percentage of the total contract price awarded to the minority firm or firms the prime contractors commitment form or request for a waiver of the  setaside was then referred to the city human relations commission hrc the hrc verified that the mbes named in the commitment form were in fact minority owned and then either approved the commitment form or made a recommendation regarding the prime contractors request for a partial or complete waiver of the  setaside croson i  fd at  the director of general services made the final determination on compliance with the setaside provisions or the propriety of granting a waiver ibid his discretion in this regard appears to have been plenary there was no direct administrative appeal from the directors denial of a waiver once a contract had been awarded to another firm a bidder denied an award for failure to comply with the mbe requirements had a general right of protest under richmond procurement policies richmond va city code a  the plan was adopted by the richmond city council after a public hearing app  seven members of the public spoke to the merits of the ordinance five were in opposition two in favor proponents of the setaside provision relied on a study which indicated that while the general population of richmond was  black only  of the citys prime construction  us     contracts had been awarded to minority businesses in the year period from  to  it was also established that a variety of contractors associations whose representatives appeared in opposition to the ordinance had virtually no minority businesses within their membership see brief for appellant  chart listing minority membership of six local construction industry associations the citys legal counsel indicated his view that the ordinance was constitutional under this courts decision in fullilove v klutznick  us   app  councilperson marsh a proponent of the ordinance made the following statement there is some information however that i want to make sure that we put in the record i have been practicing law in this community since  and i am familiar with the practices in the construction industry in this area in the state and around the nation and i can say without equivocation that the general conduct of the construction industry in this area and the state and around the nation is one in which race discrimination and exclusion on the basis of race is widespread id at  there was no direct evidence of race discrimination on the part of the city in letting contracts or any evidence that the citys prime contractors had discriminated against minorityowned subcontractors see id at  statement of councilperson kemp the public witnesses indicated that the minority contractors were just not available there wasnt a one that gave any indication that a minority contractor would not have an opportunity if he were available opponents of the ordinance questioned both its wisdom and its legality they argued that a disparity between minorities in the population of richmond and the number of prime contracts awarded to mbes had little probative value in establishing discrimination in the construction industry id at  statement of councilperson wake representatives of various contractors associations questioned whether there  us     were enough mbes in the richmond area to satisfy the  setaside requirement id at  statement of mr beck id at  statement of mr singer id at  statement of mr murphy mr murphy noted that only  of all construction firms in the united states were minority owned and that  of these were located in california new york illinois florida and hawaii he predicted that the ordinance would thus lead to a windfall for the few minority firms in richmond ibid councilperson gillespie indicated his concern that many local labor jobs held by both blacks and whites would be lost because the ordinance put no geographic limit on the mbes eligible for the  setaside id at  some of the representatives of the local contractors organizations indicated that they did not discriminate on the basis of race and were in fact actively seeking out minority members id at  statement of mr shuman the company i work for belonged to all these contractors organizations nobody that i know of black puerto rican or any minority has ever been turned down theyre actually sought after to join to become part of us see also id at  statement of mr watts councilperson gillespie expressed his concern about the legality of the plan and asked that a vote be delayed pending consultation with outside counsel his suggestion was rejected and the ordinance was enacted by a vote of six to two with councilperson gillespie abstaining id at  on september   the city of richmond issued an invitation to bid on a project for the provision and installation of certain plumbing fixtures at the city jail on september   eugene bonn the regional manager of j a croson company croson a mechanical plumbing and heating contractor received the bid forms the project involved the installation of stainless steel urinals and water closets in the city jail products of either of two manufacturers were specified acorn engineering company acorn or bradley manufacturing company bradley bonn determined that  us     to meet the  setaside requirement a minority contractor would have to supply the fixtures the provision of the fixtures amounted to  of the total contract price on september  bonn contacted five or six mbes that were potential suppliers of the fixtures after contacting three local and state agencies that maintained lists of mbes no mbe expressed interest in the project or tendered a quote on october   the day the bids were due bonn again telephoned a group of mbes this time melvin brown president of continental metal hose continental a local mbe indicated that he wished to participate in the project brown subsequently contacted two sources of the specified fixtures in order to obtain a price quotation one supplier ferguson plumbing supply which is not an mbe had already made a quotation directly to croson and refused to quote the same fixtures to continental brown also contacted an agent of bradley one of the two manufacturers of the specified fixtures the agent was not familiar with brown or continental and indicated that a credit check was required which would take at least  days to complete on october   the sealed bids were opened croson turned out to be the only bidder with a bid of  brown and bonn met personally at the bid opening and brown informed bonn that his difficulty in obtaining credit approval had hindered his submission of a bid by october   croson had still not received a bid from continental on that date it submitted a request for a waiver of the  setaside crosons waiver request indicated that continental was unqualified and that the other mbes contacted had been unresponsive or unable to quote upon learning of crosons waiver request brown contacted an agent of acorn the other fixture manufacturer specified by the city based upon his discussions with acorn brown subsequently submitted a bid on the fixtures to croson continentals bid was  higher than the price croson had included for the fixtures in its bid to the city this  us     constituted a  increase over the market price for the fixtures with added bonding and insurance using continental would have raised the cost of the project by  on the same day that brown contacted acorn he also called city procurement officials and told them that continental an mbe could supply the fixtures specified in the city jail contract on november   the city denied crosons waiver request indicating that croson had  days to submit an mbe utilization commitment form and warned that failure to do so could result in its bid being considered unresponsive croson wrote the city on november   in the letter bonn indicated that continental was not an authorized supplier for either acorn or bradley fixtures he also noted that acorns quotation to brown was subject to credit approval and in any case was substantially higher than any other quotation croson had received finally bonn noted that continentals bid had been submitted some  days after the prime bids were due in a second letter croson laid out the additional costs that using continental to supply the fixtures would entail and asked that it be allowed to raise the overall contract price accordingly the city denied both crosons request for a waiver and its suggestion that the contract price be raised the city informed croson that it had decided to rebid the project on december   counsel for croson wrote the city asking for a review of the waiver denial the citys attorney responded that the city had elected to rebid the project and that there is no appeal of such a decision shortly thereafter croson brought this action under  usc  in the federal district court for the eastern district of virginia arguing that the richmond ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied in this case the district court upheld the plan in all respects see supplemental app to juris statement  supp app in its original opinion a divided panel of the fourth circuit  us     court of appeals affirmed croson i  fd   both courts applied a test derived from the common concerns articulated by the various supreme court opinions in fullilove v klutznick  us   and university of california regents v bakke  us   see croson i supra at  relying on the great deference which this court accorded congress findings of past discrimination in fullilove the panel majority indicated its view that the same standard should be applied to the richmond city council stating unlike the review we make of a lower court decision our task is not to determine if there was sufficient evidence to sustain the council majoritys position in any traditional sense of weighing the evidence rather it is to determine whether the legislative history    demonstrates that the council reasonably concluded that    private and governmental discrimination had contributed to the negligible percentage of public contracts awarded minority contractors  fd at  quoting fullilove supra at  powell j concurring the majority found that national findings of discrimination in the construction industry when considered in conjunction with the statistical study concerning the awarding of prime contracts in richmond rendered the city councils conclusion that low minority participation in city contracts was due to past discrimination reasonable croson i  fd at  and n  the panel opinion then turned to the second part of its synthesized fullilove test examining whether the racial quota was narrowly tailored to the legislative goals of the plan id at  first the court upheld the  setaside figure by comparing it not to the number of mbes in richmond but rather to the percentage of minority persons in the citys population id at  the panel held that to remedy the effects of past discrimination a setaside program for a period of five years obviously must require more than a  setaside to encourage minorities to enter  us     the contracting industry and to allow existing minority contractors to grow ibid thus in the courts view the  figure was reasonable in light of the undisputed fact that minorities constitute  of the population of richmond ibid croson sought certiorari from this court we granted the writ vacated the opinion of the court of appeals and remanded the case for further consideration in light of our intervening decision in wygant v jackson board of education  us   see  us   on remand a divided panel of the court of appeals struck down the richmond setaside program as violating both prongs of strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment j a croson co v richmond  fd  ca  croson ii the majority found that the core of this courts holding in wygant was that to show that a plan is justified by a compelling governmental interest a municipality that wishes to employ a racial preference cannot rest on broadbrush assumptions of historical discrimination  fd at  as the court read this requirement findings of societal discrimination will not suffice the findings must concern prior discrimination by the government unit involved id at  quoting wygant supra at  emphasis in original in this case the debate at the city council meeting revealed no record of prior discrimination by the city in awarding public contracts     croson ii supra at  moreover the statistics comparing the minority population of richmond to the percentage of prime contracts awarded to minority firms had little or no probative value in establishing prior discrimination in the relevant market and actually suggested more of a political than a remedial basis for the racial preference  fd at  the court concluded that if this plan is supported by a compelling governmental interest so is every other plan that has been enacted in the past or that will be enacted in the future id at   us     the court of appeals went on to hold that even if the city had demonstrated a compelling interest in the use of a racebased quota the  setaside was not narrowly tailored to accomplish a remedial purpose the court found that the  figure was chosen arbitrarily and was not tied to the number of minority subcontractors in richmond or to any other relevant number ibid the dissenting judge argued that the majority had misconstrued and misapplied our decision in wygant  fd at  we noted probable jurisdiction of the citys appeal  us   and we now affirm the judgment ii the parties and their supporting amici fight an initial battle over the scope of the citys power to adopt legislation designed to address the effects of past discrimination relying on our decision in wygant appellee argues that the city must limit any racebased remedial efforts to eradicating the effects of its own prior discrimination this is essentially the position taken by the court of appeals below appellant argues that our decision in fullilove is controlling and that as a result the city of richmond enjoys sweeping legislative power to define and attack the effects of prior discrimination in its local construction industry we find that neither of these two rather stark alternatives can withstand analysis in fullilove we upheld the minority setaside contained in f of the public works employment act of  pub l   stat   usc  et seq act against a challenge based on the equal protection component of the due process clause the act authorized a  billion appropriation for federal grants to state and local governments for use in public works projects the primary purpose of the act was to give the national economy a quick boost in a recessionary period funds had to be committed to state or local grantees by september   the act also contained the following requirement except to the extent the secretary  us     determines otherwise no grant shall be made under this act    unless the applicant gives satisfactory assurance to the secretary that at least  per centum of the amount of each grant shall be expended for minority business enterprises fullilove  us at  quoting  stat   usc f  mbes were defined as businesses effectively controlled by citizens of the united states who are negroes spanishspeaking orientals indians eskimos and aleuts ibid the principal opinion in fullilove written by chief justice burger did not employ strict scrutiny or any other traditional standard of equal protection review the chief justice noted at the outset that although racial classifications call for close examination the court was at the same time bound to approach its task with appropriate deference to the congress a coequal branch charged by the constitution with the power to provide for the    general welfare of the united states and to enforce by appropriate legislation the equal protection guarantees of the fourteenth amendment  us at   the principal opinion asked two questions first were the objectives of the legislation within the power of congress second was the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria a permissible means for congress to carry out its objectives within the constraints of the due process clause id at  on the issue of congressional power the chief justice found that congress commerce power was sufficiently broad to allow it to reach the practices of prime contractors on federally funded local construction projects id at  congress could mandate state and local government compliance with the setaside program under its  power to enforce the fourteenth amendment id at  citing katzenbach v morgan  us    the chief justice next turned to the constraints on congress power to employ raceconscious remedial relief his opinion stressed two factors in upholding the mbe setaside  us     first was the unique remedial powers of congress under  of the fourteenth amendment here we deal    not with the limited remedial powers of a federal court for example but with the broad remedial powers of congress it is fundamental that in no organ of government state or federal does there repose a more comprehensive remedial power than in the congress expressly charged by the constitution with competence and authority to enforce equal protection guarantees  us at  principal opinion emphasis added because of these unique powers the chief justice concluded that congress not only may induce voluntary action to assure compliance with existing federal statutory or constitutional antidiscrimination provisions but also where congress has authority to declare certain conduct unlawful it may as here authorize and induce state action to avoid such conduct id at  emphasis added in reviewing the legislative history behind the act the principal opinion focused on the evidence before congress that a nationwide history of past discrimination had reduced minority participation in federal construction grants id at  the chief justice also noted that congress drew on its experience under a of the small business act of  which had extended aid to minority businesses id at  the chief justice concluded that congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices when applied to minority businesses could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination id at  the second factor emphasized by the principal opinion in fullilove was the flexible nature of the  setaside two congressional assumptions underlay the mbe program first that the effects of past discrimination had impaired the competitive position of minority businesses and second that adjustment for the effects of past discrimination would assure  us     that at least  of the funds from the federal grant program would flow to minority businesses the chief justice noted that both of these assumptions could be rebutted by a grantee seeking a waiver of the  requirement id at  thus a waiver could be sought where minority businesses were not available to fill the  requirement or more importantly where an mbe attempted to exploit the remedial aspects of the program by charging an unreasonable price i e a price not attributable to the present effects of prior discrimination id at  the chief justice indicated that without this fine tuning to remedial purpose the statute would not have passed muster id at  in his concurring opinion justice powell relied on the legislative history adduced by the principal opinion in finding that congress reasonably concluded that private and governmental discrimination had contributed to the negligible percentage of public contracts awarded minority contractors id at  justice powell also found that the means chosen by congress particularly in light of the flexible waiver provisions were reasonably necessary to address the problem identified id at  justice powell made it clear that other governmental entities might have to show more than congress before undertaking raceconscious measures the degree of specificity required in the findings of discrimination and the breadth of discretion in the choice of remedies may vary with the nature and authority of the governmental body id at  n  appellant and its supporting amici rely heavily on fullilove for the proposition that a city council like congress need not make specific findings of discrimination to engage in raceconscious relief thus appellant argues it would be a perversion of federalism to hold that the federal government has a compelling interest in remedying the effects of racial discrimination in its own public works program but a city government does not brief for appellant  footnote omitted  us     what appellant ignores is that congress unlike any state or political subdivision has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the fourteenth amendment the power to enforce may at times also include the power to define situations which congress determines threaten principles of equality and to adopt prophylactic rules to deal with those situations see katzenbach v morgan  us at  correctly viewed  is a positive grant of legislative power authorizing congress to exercise its discretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment see also south carolina v katzenbach  us    similar interpretation of congressional power under  of the fifteenth amendment the civil war amendments themselves worked a dramatic change in the balance between congressional and state power over matters of race speaking of the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments in ex parte virginia  us    the court stated they were intended to be what they really are limitations of the powers of the states and enlargements of the power of congress that congress may identify and redress the effects of societywide discrimination does not mean that a fortiori the states and their political subdivisions are free to decide that such remedies are appropriate section  of the fourteenth amendment is an explicit constraint on state power and the states must undertake any remedial efforts in accordance with that provision to hold otherwise would be to cede control over the content of the equal protection clause to the  state legislatures and their myriad political subdivisions the mere recitation of a benign or compensatory purpose for the use of a racial classification would essentially entitle the states to exercise the full power of congress under  of the fourteenth amendment and insulate any racial classification from judicial scrutiny under  we believe that such a result would be contrary to the intentions of  us     the framers of the fourteenth amendment who desired to place clear limits on the states use of race as a criterion for legislative action and to have the federal courts enforce those limitations see associated general contractors of cal v city and cty of san francisco  fd at  kozinski j the city is not just like the federal government with regard to the findings it must make to justify raceconscious remedial action see also days fullilove  yale l j    hereinafter days fullilove clearly focused on the constitutionality of a congressionally mandated setaside program emphasis in original bohrer bakke weber and fullilove benign discrimination and congressional power to enforce the fourteenth amendment  ind l j    congress may authorize pursuant to section  state action that would be foreclosed to the states acting alone we do not as justice marshalls dissent suggests see post at  find in  of the fourteenth amendment some form of federal preemption in matters of race we simply note what should be apparent to all   of the fourteenth amendment stemmed from a distrust of state legislative enactments based on race  is as the dissent notes a positive grant of legislative power to congress post at  quoting katzenbach v morgan supra at  emphasis in dissent thus our treatment of an exercise of congressional power in fullilove cannot be dispositive here in the slaughterhouse cases  wall   cited by the dissent post at  the court noted that the civil war amendments granted additional powers to the federal government and laid additional restraints upon those of the states  wall at  it would seem equally clear however that a state or local subdivision if delegated the authority from the state has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination  us     within its own legislative jurisdiction  this authority must of course be exercised within the constraints of  of the fourteenth amendment our decision in wygant is not to the contrary wygant addressed the constitutionality of the use of racial quotas by local school authorities pursuant to an agreement reached with the local teachers union it was in the context of addressing the school boards power to adopt a racebased layoff program affecting its own work force that the wygant plurality indicated that the equal protection clause required some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved wygant  us at   as a matter of state law the city of richmond has legislative authority over its procurement policies and can use its spending powers to remedy private discrimination if it identifies that discrimination with the particularity required by the fourteenth amendment to this extent on the question of the citys competence the court of appeals erred in following wygant by rote in a case involving a state entity which has statelaw authority to address discriminatory practices within local commerce under its jurisdiction thus if the city could show that it had essentially become a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry we think it clear that the city could take affirmative steps to dismantle such a system it is beyond dispute that any public entity state or federal has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice cf norwood v harrison  us    racial discrimination in stateoperated schools is barred by the constitution and it is also axiomatic that a state may not induce  us     encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish citation and internal quotations omitted iii a the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall    deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws emphasis added as this court has noted in the past the rights created

citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely upon their race to whatever racial group these citizens belong their personal rights to be treated with equal dignity and respect are implicated by a rigid rule erecting race as the sole criterion in an aspect of public decisionmaking absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such racebased measures there is simply no way of determining what classifications are benign or remedial and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics indeed the purpose of strict scrutiny is to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool the test also ensures that the means chosen fit this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype classification based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility see university of  us     california regents v bakke  us at  opinion of powell j preferential programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relation to individual worth we thus reaffirm the view expressed by the plurality in wygant that the standard of review under the equal protection clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification wygant  us at   id at  oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment see also san antonio independent school dist v rodriguez  us    marshall j dissenting the highly suspect nature of classifications based on race nationality or alienage is well established footnotes omitted our continued adherence to the standard of review employed in wygant does not as justice marshalls dissent suggests see post at  indicate that we view racial discrimination as largely a phenomenon of the past or that government bodies need no longer preoccupy themselves with rectifying racial injustice as we indicate see infra at  states and their local subdivisions have many legislative weapons at their disposal both to punish and prevent present discrimination and to remove arbitrary barriers to minority advancement rather our interpretation of  stems from our agreement with the view expressed by justice powell in bakke that the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color bakke supra at  under the standard proposed by justice marshalls dissent raceconscious classifications designed to further remedial goals post at  are forthwith subject to a relaxed standard of review how the dissent arrives at the legal conclusion that a racial classification is designed to further remedial goals without first engaging in an examination of  us     the factual basis for its enactment and the nexus between its scope and that factual basis we are not told however once the remedial conclusion is reached the dissents standard is singularly deferential and bears little resemblance to the close examination of legislative purpose we have engaged in when reviewing classifications based either on race or gender see weinberger v wiesenfeld  us    the mere recitation of a benign compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme the dissents watereddown version of equal protection review effectively assures that race will always be relevant in american life and that the ultimate goal of eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human beings race wygant supra at  stevens j dissenting footnote omitted will never be achieved even were we to accept a reading of the guarantee of equal protection under which the level of scrutiny varies according to the ability of different groups to defend their interests in the representative process heightened scrutiny would still be appropriate in the circumstances of this case one of the central arguments for applying a less exacting standard to benign racial classifications is that such measures essentially involve a choice made by dominant racial groups to disadvantage themselves if one aspect of the judiciarys role under the equal protection clause is to protect discrete and insular minorities from majoritarian prejudice or indifference see united states v carolene products co  us    n   some maintain that these concerns are not implicated when the white majority places burdens upon itself see j ely democracy and distrust   in this case blacks constitute approximately  of the population of the city of richmond five of the nine seats on the city council are held by blacks the concern that a political majority will more easily act to the disadvantage of a minority  us     based on unwarranted assumptions or incomplete facts would seem to militate for not against the application of heightened judicial scrutiny in this case see ely the constitutionality of reverse racial discrimination  u chi l rev   n   of course it works both ways a law that favors blacks over whites would be suspect if it were

entering class at the school were reserved exclusively for certain minority groups id at  among the justifications offered in support of the plan were the desire to reduce the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical school and the medical profession and the need to counter the effects of societal discrimination id at  citations omitted five members of the court

rejected the first justification for the racially segregated admissions plan the desire to have more black medical students or doctors standing alone was not merely insufficiently compelling to justify a racial classification it was discrimination for its own sake forbidden by the constitution id at  nor could the second concern the history of discrimination in society at large justify a racial quota in medical school admissions justice powell contrasted the focused goal of remedying wrongs  us     worked by specific instances of racial discrimination with the remedying of the effects of societal discrimination an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past ibid he indicated that for the governmental interest in remedying past discrimination to be triggered judicial legislative or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations must be made ibid only then does the government have a compelling interest in favoring one race over another id at  in wygant  us   four members of the court applied heightened scrutiny to a racebased system of employee layoffs justice powell writing for the plurality again drew the distinction between societal discrimination which is an inadequate basis for raceconscious classifications and the type of identified discrimination that can support and define the scope of racebased relief the challenged classification in that case tied the layoff of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students enrolled in the school district the lower courts had upheld the scheme based on the theory that minority students were in need of role models to alleviate the effects of prior discrimination in society this court reversed with a plurality of four justices reiterating the view expressed by justice powell in bakke that societal discrimination without more is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy wygant supra at  the role model theory employed by the lower courts failed for two reasons first the statistical disparity between students and teachers had no probative value in demonstrating the kind of prior discrimination in hiring or promotion that would justify racebased relief  us at   see also id at  oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment the disparity between the percentage of minorities on the teaching staff and the percentage of minorities in the student body is not probative of employment discrimination second because the role model theory had no  us     relation to some basis for believing a constitutional or statutory violation had occurred it could be used to justify racebased decisionmaking essentially limitless in scope and duration id at  plurality opinion in the absence of particularized findings a court could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past and timeless in their ability to affect the future b we think it clear that the factual predicate offered in support of the richmond plan suffers from the same two defects identified as fatal in wygant the district court found the city councils findings sufficient to ensure that in adopting the plan it was remedying the present effects of past discrimination in the construction industry supp app  emphasis added like the role model theory employed in wygant a generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy it has no logical stopping point wygant supra at  plurality opinion relief for such an illdefined wrong could extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded to mbes in richmond mirrored the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole appellant argues that it is attempting to remedy various forms of past discrimination that are alleged to be responsible for the small number of minority businesses in the local contracting industry among these the city cites the exclusion of blacks from skilled construction trade unions and training programs this past discrimination has prevented them from following the traditional path from laborer to entrepreneur brief for appellant  the city also lists a host of nonracial factors which would seem to face a member of any racial group attempting to establish a new business enterprise such as deficiencies in working capital inability to meet bonding requirements unfamiliarity with bidding procedures  us     and disability caused by an inadequate track record id at  and n  while there is no doubt that the sorry history of both private and public discrimination in this country has contributed to a lack of opportunities for black entrepreneurs this observation standing alone cannot justify a rigid racial quota in the awarding of public contracts in richmond virginia like the claim that discrimination in primary and secondary schooling justifies a rigid racial preference in medical school admissions an amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota it is sheer speculation how many minority firms there would be in richmond absent past societal discrimination just as it was sheer speculation how many minority medical students would have been admitted to the medical school at davis absent past discrimination in educational opportunities defining these sorts of injuries as identified discrimination would give local governments license to create a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations about any particular field of endeavor these defects are readily apparent in this case the  quota cannot in any realistic sense be tied to any injury suffered by anyone the district court relied upon five predicate facts in reaching its conclusion that there was an adequate basis for the  quota  the ordinance declares itself to be remedial  several proponents of the measure stated their views that there had been past discrimination in the construction industry  minority businesses received  of prime contracts from the city while minorities constituted  of the citys population  there were very few minority contractors in local and state contractors associations and  in  congress made a determination that the effects of past discrimination had stifled minority participation in the construction industry nationally supp app   us     none of these findings singly or together provide the city of richmond with a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary wygant  us at  plurality opinion there is nothing approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by anyone in the richmond construction industry id at  see also id at  oconnor j concurring the district court accorded great weight to the fact that the city council designated the plan as remedial but the mere recitation of a benign or legitimate purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no weight see weinberger v wiesenfeld  us at   n  this court need not in equal protection cases accept at face value assertions of legislative purposes when an examination of the legislative scheme and its history demonstrates that the asserted purpose could not have been a goal of the legislation racial classifications are suspect and that means that simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot suffice the district court also relied on the highly conclusionary statement of a proponent of the plan that there was racial discrimination in the construction industry in this area and the state and around the nation app  statement of councilperson marsh it also noted that the city manager had related his view that racial discrimination still plagued the construction industry in his home city of pittsburgh id at  statement of mr deese these statements are of little probative value in establishing identified discrimination in the richmond construction industry the factfinding process of legislative bodies is generally entitled to a presumption of regularity and deferential review by the judiciary see williamson v lee optical of oklahoma inc  us     but when a legislative body chooses to employ a suspect classification it cannot rest upon a generalized assertion as to the classifications relevance to its goals see mclaughlin v florida  us     a  us     governmental actor cannot render race a legitimate proxy for a particular condition merely by declaring that the condition exists see id at  wygant supra at  the history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis see korematsu v united states  us     murphy j dissenting reliance on the disparity between the number of prime contracts awarded to minority firms and the minority population of the city of richmond is similarly misplaced there is no doubt that where gross statistical disparities can be shown they alone in a proper case may constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination under title vii hazelwood school dist v united states  us     but it is equally clear that when special qualifications are required to fill particular jobs comparisons to the general population rather than to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications may have little probative value id at  n  see also mayor of philadelphia v educational equality league  us    this is not a case in which it can be assumed that all citizens are fungible for purposes of determining whether members of a particular class have been unlawfully excluded in the employment context we have recognized that for certain entry level positions or positions requiring minimal training statistical comparisons of the racial composition of an employers work force to the racial composition of the relevant population may be probative of a pattern of discrimination see teamsters v united states  us     statistical comparison between minority truckdrivers and relevant population probative of discriminatory exclusion but where special qualifications are necessary the relevant statistical pool for purposes of demonstrating  us     discriminatory exclusion must be the number of minorities qualified to undertake the particular task see hazelwood supra at  johnson v transportation agency santa clara county  us     oconnor j concurring in judgment in this case the city does not even know how many mbes in the relevant market are qualified to undertake prime or subcontracting work in public construction projects cf ohio contractors assn v keip  fd at  relying on percentage of minority businesses in the state compared to percentage of state purchasing contracts awarded to minority firms in upholding setaside nor does the city know what percentage of total city construction dollars minority firms now receive as subcontractors on prime contracts let by the city to a large extent the setaside of subcontracting dollars seems to rest on the unsupported assumption that white prime contractors simply will not hire minority firms see associated general contractors of cal v city and cty of san francisco  fd at  there is no finding  and we decline to assume  that male caucasian contractors will award contracts only to other male caucasians  indeed there is evidence in this record that overall minority participation in city contracts in richmond is  to  and that minority contractor participation in community block development grant construction projects is  to  app  statement of mr deese city manager without any information  us     on minority participation in subcontracting it is quite simply impossible to evaluate overall minority representation in the citys construction expenditures the city and the district court also relied on evidence that mbe membership in local contractors associations was extremely low again standing alone this evidence is not probative of any discrimination in the local construction industry there are numerous explanations for this dearth of minority participation including past societal discrimination in education and economic opportunities as well as both black and white career and entrepreneurial choices blacks may be disproportionately attracted to industries other than construction see the state of small business a report of the president   relative to the distribution of all businesses blackowned businesses are more than proportionally represented in the transportation industry but considerably less than proportionally represented in the wholesale trade manufacturing and finance industries the mere fact that black membership in these trade organizations is low standing alone cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination cf bazemore v friday  us     mere existence of single race clubs in absence of evidence of exclusion by race cannot create a duty to integrate for low minority membership in these associations to be relevant the city would have to link it to the number of local mbes eligible for membership if the statistical disparity between eligible mbes and mbe membership were great enough an inference of discriminatory exclusion could arise in such a case the city would have a compelling interest in preventing its tax dollars from assisting these organizations in maintaining a racially segregated construction market see norwood  us at   ohio contractors supra at  upholding minority setaside based in part on earlier district court finding that the state had become a joint participant with private industry and certain craft unions in  us     a pattern of racially discriminatory conduct which excluded black laborers from work on public construction contracts finally the city and the district court relied on congress finding in connection with the setaside approved in fullilove that there had been nationwide discrimination in the construction industry the probative value of these findings for demonstrating the existence of discrimination in richmond is extremely limited by its inclusion of a waiver procedure in the national program addressed in fullilove congress explicitly recognized that the scope of the problem would vary from market area to market area see fullilove  us at  noting that the presumption that minority firms are disadvantaged by past discrimination may be rebutted by grantees in individual situations moreover as noted above congress was exercising its powers under  of the fourteenth amendment in making a finding that past discrimination would cause federal funds to be distributed in a manner which reinforced prior patterns of discrimination while the states and their subdivisions may take remedial action when they possess evidence that their own spending practices are exacerbating a pattern of prior discrimination they must identify that discrimination public or private with some specificity before they may use raceconscious relief congress has made national findings that there has been societal discrimination in a host of fields if all a state or local government need do is find a congressional report on the subject to enact a setaside program the constraints of the equal protection clause will in effect have been rendered a nullity see days  it is essential that state and local agencies also establish the presence of discrimination in their own bailiwicks based either upon their own factfinding processes or upon determinations made by other competent institutions justice marshall apparently views the requirement that richmond identify the discrimination it seeks to remedy in its own jurisdiction as a mere administrative headache an  us     onerous documentary obligation post at  we cannot agree in this regard we are in accord with justice stevens observation in fullilove that because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic it is especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate fullilove supra at  dissenting opinion footnotes omitted the evidence relied upon by the dissent the history of school desegregation in richmond and numerous congressional reports does little to define the scope of any injury to minority contractors in richmond or the necessary remedy the factors relied upon by the dissent could justify a preference of any size or duration moreover justice marshalls suggestion that findings of discrimination may be shared from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the same manner as information concerning zoning and property values is unprecedented see post at  quoting renton v playtime theatres inc  us     we have never approved the extrapolation of discrimination in one jurisdiction from the experience of another see milliken v bradley  us    disparate treatment of white and negro students occurred within the detroit school system and not elsewhere and on this record the remedy must be limited to that system in sum none of the evidence presented by the city points to any identified discrimination in the richmond construction industry we therefore hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race to accept richmonds claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for remedial relief for every disadvantaged group the dream of a nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity  us     and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications     bakke  us at   powell j we think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality the foregoing analysis applies only to the inclusion of blacks within the richmond setaside program there is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against spanishspeaking oriental indian eskimo or aleut persons in any aspect of the richmond construction industry the district court took judicial notice of the fact that the vast majority of minority persons in richmond were black supp app  it may well be that richmond has never had an aleut or eskimo citizen the random inclusion of racial groups that as a practical matter may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry in richmond suggests that perhaps the citys purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination if a  setaside was narrowly tailored to compensate black contractors for past discrimination one may legitimately ask why they are forced to share this remedial relief with an aleut citizen who moves to richmond tomorrow the gross overinclusiveness of richmonds racial preference strongly impugns the citys claim of remedial motivation see wygant  us at   n  haphazard inclusion of racial groups further illustrates the undifferentiated nature of the plan see also days  such programs leave one with the sense that the racial and ethnic groups favored by the setaside were added without attention to whether their inclusion was justified by evidence of past discrimination  us     iv as noted by the court below it is almost impossible to assess whether the richmond plan is narrowly tailored to remedy prior discrimination since it is not linked to identified discrimination in any way we limit ourselves to two observations in this regard first there does not appear to have been any consideration of the use of raceneutral means to increase minority business participation in city contracting see united states v paradise  us    in determining whether raceconscious remedies are appropriate we look to several factors including the efficacy of alternative remedies many of the barriers to minority participation in the construction industry relied upon by the city to justify a racial classification appear to be race neutral if mbes disproportionately lack capital or cannot meet bonding requirements a raceneutral program of city financing for small firms would a fortiori lead to greater minority participation the principal opinion in fullilove found that congress had carefully examined and rejected raceneutral alternatives before enacting the mbe setaside see fullilove  us at   see also id at  powell j concurring by the time congress enacted the mbe setaside in  it knew that other remedies had failed to ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination in the construction industry there is no evidence in this record that the richmond city council has considered any alternatives to a racebased quota second the  quota cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal except perhaps outright racial balancing it rests upon the completely unrealistic assumption that minorities will choose a particular trade in lockstep proportion to their representation in the local population see sheet metal workers v eeoc  us    oconnor j concurring in part and dissenting in part it is completely unrealistic to assume that individuals of  us     one race will gravitate with mathematical exactitude to each employer or union absent unlawful discrimination since the city must already consider bids and waivers on a casebycase basis it is difficult to see the need for a rigid numerical quota as noted above the congressional scheme upheld in fullilove allowed for a waiver of the setaside provision where an mbes higher price was not attributable to the effects of past discrimination based upon proper findings such programs are less problematic from an equal protection standpoint because they treat all candidates individually rather than making the color of an applicants skin the sole relevant consideration unlike the program upheld in fullilove the richmond plans waiver system focuses solely on the availability of mbes there is no inquiry into whether or not the particular mbe seeking a racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors given the existence of an individualized procedure the citys only interest in maintaining a quota system rather than investigating the need for remedial action in particular cases would seem to be simple administrative convenience but the interest in avoiding the bureaucratic effort necessary to tailor remedial relief to those who truly have suffered the effects of prior discrimination cannot justify a rigid line drawn on the basis of a suspect classification see frontiero v richardson  us    plurality opinion when we enter the realm of strict judicial scrutiny there can be no doubt that administrative convenience is not a shibboleth the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality under richmonds scheme a successful black hispanic or oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race we think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination  us     v nothing we say today precludes a state or local entity from taking action to rectify the effects of identified discrimination within its jurisdiction if the city of richmond had evidence before it that nonminority contractors were systematically excluding minority businesses from subcontracting opportunities it could take action to end the discriminatory exclusion where there is a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged by the locality or the localitys prime contractors an inference of discriminatory exclusion could arise see bazemore v friday  us at   teamsters v united states  us at   under such circumstances the city could act to dismantle the closed business system by taking appropriate measures against those who discriminate on the basis of race or other illegitimate criteria see e g new york state club assn v new york city  us      in the extreme case some form of narrowly tailored racial preference might be necessary to break down patterns of deliberate exclusion nor is local government powerless to deal with individual instances of racially motivated refusals to employ minority contractors where such discrimination occurs a city would be justified in penalizing the discriminator and providing appropriate relief to the victim of such discrimination see generally mcdonnell douglas corp v green  us     moreover evidence of a pattern of individual discriminatory acts can if supported by appropriate statistical proof lend support to a local governments determination that broader remedial relief is justified see teamsters supra at  even in the absence of evidence of discrimination the city has at its disposal a whole array of raceneutral devices to increase the accessibility of city contracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races simplification of bidding  us     procedures relaxation of bonding requirements and training and financial aid for disadvantaged entrepreneurs of all races would open the public contracting market to all those who have suffered the effects of past societal discrimination or neglect many of the formal barriers to new entrants may be the product of bureaucratic inertia more than actual necessity and may have a disproportionate effect on the opportunities open to new minority firms their elimination or modification would have little detrimental effect on the citys interests and would serve to increase the opportunities available to minority business without classifying individuals on the basis of race the city may also act to prohibit discrimination in the provision of credit or bonding by local suppliers and banks business as usual should not mean business pursuant to the unthinking exclusion of certain members of our society from its rewards in the case at hand the city has not ascertained how many minority enterprises are present in the local construction market nor the level of their participation in city construction projects the city points to no evidence that qualified minority contractors have been passed over for city contracts or subcontracts either as a group or in any individual case under such circumstances it is simply impossible to say that the city has demonstrated a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary wygant  us at   proper findings in this regard are necessary to define both the scope of the injury and the extent of the remedy necessary to cure its effects such findings also serve to assure all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself absent such findings there is a danger that a racial classification is merely the product of unthinking stereotypes or a form of racial politics if there is no duty to attempt either to measure the recovery by the wrong or to distribute that recovery  us     within the injured class in an evenhanded way our history will adequately support a legislative preference for almost any ethnic religious or racial group with the political strength to negotiate a piece of the action for its members fullilove  us at  stevens j dissenting because the city of richmond has failed to identify the need for remedial action in the awarding of its public construction contracts its treatment of its citizens on a racial basis violates the dictates of the equal protection clause accordingly the judgment of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit is affirmed footnotes  footnote   the expiration of the ordinance has not rendered the controversy between the city and appellee moot there remains a live controversy between the parties over whether richmonds refusal to award appellee a contract pursuant to the ordinance was unlawful and thus entitles appellee to damages see memphis light gas  water div v craft  us      footnote   in its original panel opinion the court of appeals held that under virginia law the city had the legal authority to enact the setaside program croson i  fd   ca  that determination was not disturbed by the courts subsequent holding that the plan violated the equal protection clause  footnote   since  the city of richmond has had an ordinance on the books prohibiting both discrimination in the award of public contracts and employment discrimination by public contractors see reply brief for appellant  n  citing richmond va city code  et seq  the city points to no evidence that its prime contractors have been violating the ordinance in either their employment or subcontracting practices the complete silence of the record concerning enforcement of the citys own antidiscrimination ordinance flies in the face of the dissents vision of a tightknit industry which has prevented blacks from obtaining the experience necessary to participate in construction contracting see post at  justice stevens concurring in part and concurring in the judgment a central purpose of the fourteenth amendment is to further the national goal of equal opportunity for all our citizens in order to achieve that goal we must learn from our past mistakes but i believe the constitution requires us to evaluate our policy decisions  including those that govern the relationships among different racial and ethnic groups  primarily by studying their probable impact on the future i therefore do not agree with the premise that seems to underlie todays decision as well as the decision in wygant v jackson board of education  us   that a governmental decision that rests on a racial classification is never permissible except as a remedy for a past wrong see ante at   i do however agree with the courts explanation  us     of why the richmond ordinance cannot be justified as a remedy for past discrimination and therefore join parts i iiib and iv of its opinion i write separately to emphasize three aspects of the case that are of special importance to me first the city makes no claim that the public interest in the efficient performance of its construction contracts will be served by granting a preference to minoritybusiness enterprises this case is therefore completely unlike wygant in which i thought it quite obvious that the school board had reasonably concluded that an integrated faculty could provide educational benefits to the entire student body that could not be provided by an allwhite or nearly allwhite faculty as i pointed out in my dissent in that case even if we completely disregard our history of racial injustice race is not always irrelevant to sound governmental decisionmaking  in the  us     case of public contracting however if we disregard the past there is not even an arguable basis for suggesting that the race of a subcontractor or general contractor should have any relevance to his or her access to the market second this litigation involves an attempt by a legislative body rather than a court to fashion a remedy for a past wrong legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct the constitutional prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of private citizens  it is the judicial system rather than the legislative process that is best equipped to identify  us     past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed thus in cases involving the review of judicial remedies imposed against persons who have been proved guilty of violations of law i would allow the courts in racial discrimination cases the same broad discretion that chancellors enjoy in other areas of the law see swann v charlottemecklenburg board of education  us        third instead of engaging in a debate over the proper standard of review to apply in affirmativeaction litigation  i believe it is more constructive to try to identify the characteristics of the advantaged and disadvantaged classes that may justify their disparate treatment see cleburne v cleburne living center inc  us     stevens j concurring  in this case that approach convinces  us     me that instead of carefully identifying the characteristics of the two classes of contractors that are respectively favored and disfavored by its ordinance the richmond city council has merely engaged in the type of stereotypical analysis that is a hallmark of violations of the equal protection clause whether we look at the class of persons benefited by the ordinance or at the disadvantaged class the same conclusion emerges the justification for the ordinance is the fact that in the past white contractors  and presumably other white citizens in richmond  have discriminated against black contractors the class of persons benefited by the ordinance is not however limited to victims of such discrimination  it encompasses persons who have never been in business in richmond as well as minority contractors who may have been guilty of discriminating against members of other minority groups indeed for all the record shows all of the minoritybusiness enterprises that have benefited from the ordinance may be firms that have prospered notwithstanding the discriminatory conduct that may have harmed other minority firms years ago ironically minority firms that have survived in the competitive struggle rather than those that have perished are most likely to benefit from an ordinance of this kind the ordinance is equally vulnerable because of its failure to identify the characteristics of the disadvantaged class of  us     white contractors that justify the disparate treatment that class unquestionably includes some white contractors who are guilty of past discrimination against blacks but it is only habit rather than evidence or analysis that makes it seem acceptable to assume that every white contractor covered by the ordinance shares in that guilt indeed even among those who have discriminated in the past it must be assumed that at least some of them have complied with the city ordinance that has made such discrimination unlawful since   thus the composition of the disadvantaged class of white contractors presumably includes some who have been guilty of unlawful discrimination some who practiced discrimination before it was forbidden by law  and some who have never discriminated against anyone on the basis of race imposing a common burden on such a disparate class merely because each member of the class is of the same race stems from reliance on a stereotype rather than fact or reason    there is a special irony in the stereotypical thinking that prompts legislation of this kind although it stigmatizes the disadvantaged class with the unproven charge of past racial discrimination it actually imposes a greater stigma on its  us     supposed beneficiaries for as i explained in my opinion in fullilove v klutznick  us   even though it is not the actual predicate for this legislation a statute of this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race id at  the risk that habitual attitudes toward classes of persons rather than analysis of the relevant characteristics of the class will serve as a basis for a legislative classification is present when benefits are distributed as well as when burdens are imposed in the past traditional attitudes too often provided the only explanation for discrimination against women aliens illegitimates and black citizens today there is a danger that awareness of past injustice will lead to automatic acceptance of new classifications that are not in fact justified by attributes characteristic of the class as a whole when government creates a special preference or a special disability for a class of persons it should identify the characteristic that justifies the special treatment when the classification is defined in racial terms i believe that such particular identification is imperative in this case only two conceivable bases for differentiating the preferred classes from society as a whole have occurred to me  that they were the victims of unfair treatment in the past and  that they are less able to compete in the future although the first of these factors would justify an appropriate remedy for past wrongs for reasons that i have already stated this statute is not such a remedial measure the second factor is simply not true nothing in the record of this case the legislative history of the act or experience that we may notice judicially provides any support for such a proposition id at  footnote omitted  us     accordingly i concur in parts i iiib and iv of the courts opinion and in the judgment  footnote   in my view the courts approach to this case gives unwarranted deference to racebased legislative action that purports to serve a purely remedial goal and overlooks the potential value of racebased determinations that may serve other valid purposes with regard to the former point  as i explained at some length in fullilove v klutznick  us     dissenting opinion  i am not prepared to assume that even a more narrowly tailored setaside program supported by stronger findings would be constitutionally justified unless the legislature can identify both the particular victims and the particular perpetrators of past  us     discrimination which is precisely what a court does when it makes findings of fact and conclusions of law a remedial justification for racebased legislation will almost certainly sweep too broadly with regard to the latter point i think it unfortunate that the court in neither wygant nor this case seems prepared to acknowledge that some racebased policy decisions may serve a legitimate public purpose i agree of course that race is so seldom relevant to legislative decisions on how best to foster the public good that legitimate justifications for racebased legislation will usually not be available but unlike the court i would not totally discount the legitimacy of racebased decisions that may produce tangible and fully justified future benefits see n  infra see also justice powells discussion in university of california regents v bakke  us      footnote   rather than analyzing a case of this kind by asking whether minority teachers have some sort of special entitlement of jobs as a remedy for sins that were committed in the past i believe that we should first ask whether the boards action advances the public interest in educating children for the future      in our present society race is not always irrelevant to sound governmental decisionmaking to take the most obvious example in law enforcement if an undercover agent is needed to infiltrate a group suspected of ongoing criminal behavior  and if the members of the group are all of the same race  it would seem perfectly rational to employ an agent of that race rather than a member of a different racial class similarly in a city  us     with a recent history of racial unrest the superintendent of police might reasonably conclude that an integrated police force could develop a better relationship with the community and thereby do a more effective job of maintaining law and order than a force composed only of white officers in the context of public education it is quite obvious that a school board may reasonably conclude that an integrated faculty will be able to provide benefits to the student body that could not be provided by an allwhite or nearly allwhite faculty for one of the most important lessons that the american public schools teach is that the diverse ethnic cultural and national backgrounds that have been brought together in our famous melting pot do not identify essential differences among the human beings that inhabit our land it is one thing for a white child to be taught by a white teacher that color like beauty is only skin deep it is far more convincing to experience that truth on a daytoday basis during the routine ongoing learning process wygant v jackson board of education  us at   footnotes omitted  footnote   see us const art i  cl   cl  of course legislatures frequently appropriate funds to compensate victims of past governmental misconduct for which there is no judicial remedy see e g pub l   stat  provision of restitution to interned japaneseamericans during world war ii thus it would have been consistent with normal practice for the city of richmond to provide direct monetary compensation to any minoritybusiness enterprise that the city might have injured in the past such a voluntary decision by a public body is however quite different from a decision to require one private party to compensate another for an unproven injury  footnote   as i pointed out in my separate opinion concurring in the judgment in united states v paradise  us     a party who has been found guilty of repeated and persistent violations of the law bears the burden of demonstrating that the chancellors efforts to fashion effective relief exceed the bounds of reasonableness the burden of proof in a case like this is precisely the opposite of that in cases such as wygant v jackson board of education  us   and fullilove v klutznick  us   which did not involve any proven violations of law in such cases the governmental decisionmaker who would make raceconscious decisions must overcome a strong presumption against them no such burden rests on a federal district judge who has found that the governmental unit before him is guilty of racially discriminatory conduct that violates the constitution  footnote   there is only one equal protection clause it requires every state to govern impartially it does not direct the courts to apply one standard of review in some cases and a different standard in other cases craig v boren  us     stevens j concurring  footnote   i have always asked myself whether i could find a rational basis for the classification at issue the term rational of course includes a requirement that an impartial lawmaker could logically believe that the classification would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends the harm to the members of the disadvantaged class thus the word rational  for me at least  includes elements of legitimacy and neutrality  us     that must always characterize the performance of the sovereigns duty to govern impartially      in every equal protection case we have to ask certain basic questions what class is harmed by the legislation and has it been subjected to a tradition of disfavor by our laws what is the public purpose that is being served by the law what is the characteristic of the disadvantaged class that justifies the disparate treatment in most cases the answer to these questions will tell us whether the statute has a rational basis cleburne v cleburne living center inc  us at   stevens j concurring  footnote   see ante at  n   footnote   there is surely some question about the power of a legislature to impose a statutory burden on private citizens for engaging in discriminatory practices at a time when such practices were not unlawful cf teamsters v united states  us       footnote   there is of course another possibility that should not be overlooked the ordinance might be nothing more than a form of patronage but racial patronage like a racial gerrymander is no more defensible than political patronage or a political gerrymander cf karcher v daggett  us     stevens j concurring rogers v lodge  us     stevens j dissenting mobile v bolden  us     stevens j concurring in judgment cousins v city council of chicago  fd   ca stevens j dissenting cert denied  us   a southern state with a long history of discrimination against republicans in the awarding of public contracts could not rely on such past discrimination as a basis for granting a legislative preference to republican contractors in the future justice kennedy concurring in part and concurring in the judgment i join all but part ii of justice oconnors opinion and give this further explanation part ii examines our case law upholding congressional power to grant preferences based on overt and explicit classification by race see fullilove v klutznick  us   with the acknowledgment that the summary in part ii is both precise and fair i must decline to join it the process by which a law that is an equal protection violation when enacted by a state becomes transformed to an equal protection guarantee when enacted by congress poses a difficult proposition for me but as it is not before us any reconsideration of that issue must await some further case for purposes of the ordinance challenged here it suffices to say that the state has the power to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects in both the public and private sectors and the absolute duty to do so where those wrongs were caused intentionally by the state itself the fourteenth amendment ought not to be interpreted to reduce a states authority in this regard unless of course there is a conflict with federal law or a state remedy is itself a violation of equal protection the latter is the case presented here the moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the equal protection clause justice scalias opinion underscores that proposition quite properly in my view the rule suggested in his opinion which would strike down all preferences which are not necessary remedies to victims of unlawful discrimination would serve important structural goals as it would eliminate the necessity for courts to pass upon each racial preference that is enacted structural protections may be necessities if moral imperatives are to be obeyed his opinion would make it crystal clear to the  us     political branches at least those of the states that legislation must be based on criteria other than race nevertheless given that a rule of automatic invalidity for racial preferences in almost every case would be a significant break with our precedents that require a casebycase test i am not convinced we need adopt it at this point on the assumption that it will vindicate the principle of race neutrality found in the equal protection clause i accept the less absolute rule contained in justice oconnors opinion a rule based on the proposition that any racial preference must face the most rigorous scrutiny by the courts my reasons for doing so are as follows first i am confident that in application the strict scrutiny standard will operate in a manner generally consistent with the imperative of race neutrality because it forbids the use even of narrowly drawn racial classifications except as a last resort second the rule against raceconscious remedies is already less than an absolute one for that relief may be the only adequate remedy after a judicial determination that a state or its instrumentality has violated the equal protection clause i note in this connection that evidence which would support a judicial finding of intentional discrimination may suffice also to justify remedial legislative action for it diminishes the constitutional responsibilities of the political branches to say they must wait to act until ordered to do so by a court third the strict scrutiny rule is consistent with our precedents as justice oconnors opinion demonstrates the ordinance before us falls far short of the standard we adopt the nature and scope of the injury that existed its historical or antecedent causes the extent to which the city contributed to it either by intentional acts or by passive complicity in acts of discrimination by the private sector the necessity for the response adopted its duration in relation to the wrong and the precision with which it otherwise bore on whatever injury in fact was addressed were all matters unmeasured unexplored and unexplained by the city council we  us     are left with an ordinance and a legislative record open to the fair charge that it is not a remedy but is itself a preference which will cause the same corrosive animosities that the constitution forbids in the whole sphere of government and that our national policy condemns in the rest of society as well this ordinance is invalid under the fourteenth amendment justice scalia concurring in the judgment i agree with much of the courts opinion and in particular with justice oconnors conclusion that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race whether or not its asserted purpose is remedial or benign ante at   i do not agree however with justice oconnors dictum suggesting that despite the fourteenth amendment state and local governments may in some circumstances discriminate on the basis of race in order in a broad sense to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination ante at  the benign purpose of compensating for social disadvantages whether they have been acquired by reason of prior discrimination or otherwise can no more be pursued by the illegitimate means of racial discrimination than can other assertedly benign purposes we have repeatedly rejected see e g wygant v jackson board of education  us     plurality opinion discrimination in teacher assignments to provide role models for minority students palmore v sidoti  us    awarding custody of child to father after divorced mother entered an interracial remarriage in order to spare child social pressures and stresses lee v washington  us   per curiam permanent racial segregation of all prison inmates presumably to reduce possibility of racial conflict the difficulty of overcoming the effects of past discrimination is as nothing compared with the difficulty of eradicating from our society the source of those effects which is the tendency  fatal to a nation such as ours  to classify and judge men and women on the basis of their country of origin or the color of their skin a solution  us     to the first problem that aggravates the second is no solution at all i share the view expressed by alexander bickel that the lesson of the great decisions of the supreme court and the lesson of contemporary history have been the same for at least a generation discrimination on the basis of race is illegal immoral unconstitutional inherently wrong and destructive of democratic society a bickel the morality of consent   at least where state or local action is at issue only a social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb  for example a prison race riot requiring temporary segregation of inmates cf lee v washington supra  can justify an exception to the principle embodied in the fourteenth amendment that our constitution is colorblind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens plessy v ferguson  us    harlan j dissenting accord ex parte virginia  us     j story commentaries on the constitution  p  t cooley ed  t cooley constitutional limitations  d ed  we have in some contexts approved the use of racial classifications by the federal government to remedy the effects of past discrimination i do not believe that we must or should extend those holdings to the states in fullilove v klutznick  us   we upheld legislative action by congress similar in its asserted purpose to that at issue here and we have permitted federal courts to prescribe quite severe raceconscious remedies when confronted with egregious and persistent unlawful discrimination see e g united states v paradise  us   sheet metal workers v eeoc  us   as justice oconnor acknowledges however ante at  it is one thing to permit racially based conduct by the federal government  whose legislative powers concerning matters of race were explicitly enhanced by the fourteenth amendment see us const amdt    and quite another to permit it by the precise entities against whose conduct in  us     matters of race that amendment was specifically directed see amdt   as we said in ex parte virginia supra at  the civil war amendments were designed to take away all possibility of oppression by law because of race or color and to be    limitations on the power of the states and enlargements of the power of congress thus without revisiting what we held in fullilove or trying to derive a rationale from the three separate opinions supporting the judgment none of which commanded more than three votes compare  us at   opinion of burger c j joined by white and powell jj with id at  opinion of powell j and id at  opinion of marshall j joined by brennan and blackmun jj i do not believe our decision in that case controls the one before us here a sound distinction between federal and state or local action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the civil war amendments but upon social reality and governmental theory it is a simple fact that what justice stewart described in fullilove as the dispassionate objectivity and the flexibility that are needed to mold a raceconscious remedy around the single objective of eliminating the effects of past or present discrimination  political qualities already to be doubted in a national legislature fullilove supra at  stewart j with whom rehnquist j joined dissenting  are substantially less likely to exist at the state or local level the struggle for racial justice has historically been a struggle by the national society against oppression in the individual states see e g ex parte virginia supra denying writ of habeas corpus to a state judge in custody under federal indictment for excluding jurors on the basis of race h hyman  w wiecek equal justice under law  pp   logan judicial federalism in the court of history  ore l rev    and the struggle retains that character in modern times see e g brown v board of education  us   brown ii united states v montgomery board of education  us      us   swann v charlottemecklenburg board of education  us   griffin v prince edward county school board  us   cooper v aaron  us   not all of that struggle has involved discrimination against blacks see e g yick wo v hopkins  us   chinese hernandez v texas  us   hispanics and not all of it has been in the old south see e g columbus board of education v penick  us   keyes v school dist no  denver colorado  us   what the record shows in other words is that racial discrimination against any group finds a more ready expression at the state and local than at the federal level to the children of the founding fathers this should come as no surprise an acute awareness of the heightened danger of oppression from political factions in small rather than large political units dates to the very beginning of our national history see g wood the creation of the american republic  pp   as james madison observed in support of the proposed constitutions enhancement of national powers the smaller the society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it the fewer the distinct parties and interests the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed the more easily will they concert and execute their plan of oppression extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other the federalist no  pp  c rossiter ed   us     the prophesy of these words came to fruition in richmond in the enactment of a setaside clearly and directly beneficial to the dominant political group which happens also to be the dominant racial group the same thing has no doubt happened before in other cities though the racial basis of the preference has rarely been made textually explicit  and blacks have often been on the receiving end of the injustice where injustice is the game however turnabout is not fair play in my view there is only one circumstance in which the states may act by race to undo the effects of past discrimination where that is necessary to eliminate their own maintenance of a system of unlawful racial classification if for example a state agency has a discriminatory pay scale compensating black employees in all positions at  less than their nonblack counterparts it may assuredly promulgate an order raising the salaries of all black employees to eliminate the differential cf bazemore v friday  us     this distinction explains our school desegregation cases in which we have made plain that states and localities sometimes have an obligation to adopt raceconscious remedies while there is no doubt that those cases have taken into account the continuing effects of previously mandated racial school assignment we have held those effects to justify a raceconscious remedy only because we have concluded in that context that they perpetuate a dual school system we have stressed each school districts constitutional duty to dismantle its dual system and have found that each instance of a failure or refusal to fulfill this affirmative duty continues the violation of the fourteenth amendment columbus board of education v penick supra at  emphasis added concluding in this context that raceneutral efforts at dismantling the stateimposed dual system were so ineffective that they might indicate a lack of good faith green v new kent county school board  us    see also  us     raney v board of education of gould school dist  us   we have permitted as part of the local authorities affirmative duty to disestablish the dual school systems such voluntary that is noncourtordered measures as attendance zones drawn to achieve greater racial balance and outofzone assignment by race for the same purpose mcdaniel v barresi  us     while thus permitting the use of race to declassify racially classified students teachers and educational resources however we have also made it clear that the remedial power extends no further than the scope of the continuing constitutional violation see e g columbus board of education v penick supra at  dayton board of education v brinkman  us    milliken v bradley  us    keyes v school dist no  denver colorado supra at  and it is implicit in our cases that after the dual school system has been completely disestablished the states may no longer assign students by race cf pasadena city board of education v spangler  us   federal court may not require racial assignment in such circumstances our analysis in bazemore v friday supra reflected our unwillingness to conclude outside the context of school assignment that the continuing effects of prior discrimination can be equated with state maintenance of a discriminatory system there we found both that the governments adoption of wholly neutral admissions policies for h and homemaker clubs sufficed to remedy its prior constitutional violation of maintaining segregated admissions and that there was no further obligation to use racial reassignments to eliminate continuing effects  that is any remaining allblack and allwhite clubs  us at   however sound green v new kent county school board supra may have been in the context of the public schools we said it has no application to this wholly different milieu id at  the same is so here  us     a state can of course act to undo the effects of past discrimination in many permissible ways that do not involve classification by race in the particular field of state contracting for example it may adopt a preference for small businesses or even for new businesses  which would make it easier for those previously excluded by discrimination to enter the field such programs may well have racially disproportionate impact but they are not based on race and of course a state may undo the effects of past discrimination in the sense of giving the identified victim of state discrimination that which it wrongfully denied him  for example giving to a previously rejected black applicant the job that by reason of discrimination had been awarded to a white applicant even if this means terminating the latters employment in such a context the white jobholder is not being selected for disadvantageous treatment because of his race but because he was wrongfully awarded a job to which another is entitled that is worlds apart from the system here in which those to be disadvantaged are identified solely by race i agree with the courts dictum that a fundamental distinction must be drawn between the effects of societal discrimination and the effects of identified discrimination and that the situation would be different if richmonds plan were tailored to identify those particular bidders who suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors ante at  in my view however the reason that would make a difference is not as the court states that it would justify raceconscious action  see e g ante at    but rather that it would enable raceneutral remediation nothing prevents richmond from according a contracting preference to identified victims of discrimination while most of the beneficiaries might be black neither the beneficiaries nor those disadvantaged by the preference would be identified on the basis of their race in other words far from justifying racial classification identification  us     of actual victims of discrimination makes it less supportable than ever because more obviously unneeded in this final book professor bickel wrote a racial quota derogates the human dignity and individuality of all to whom it is applied it is invidious in principle as well as in practice moreover it can easily be turned against those it purports to help the history of the racial quota is a history of subjugation not beneficence its evil lies not in its name but in its effects a quota is a divider of society a creator of castes and it is all the worse for its racial base especially in a society desperately striving for an equality that will make race irrelevant bickel the morality of consent at  those statements are true and increasingly prophetic apart from their societal effects however which are in the aggregate disastrous id at  it is important not to lose sight of the fact that even benign racial quotas have individual victims whose very real injustice we ignore whenever we deny them enforcement of their right not to be disadvantaged on the basis of race johnson v transportation agency santa clara county  us    scalia j dissenting as justice douglas observed a defunis who is white is entitled to no advantage by virtue of that fact nor is he subject to any disability no matter what his race or color whatever his race he had a constitutional right to have his application considered on its individual merits in a racially neutral manner defunis v odegaard  us    dissenting opinion when we depart from this american principle we play with fire and much more than an occasional defunis johnson or croson burns it is plainly true that in our society blacks have suffered discrimination immeasurably greater than any directed at other racial groups but those who believe that racial preferences can help to even the score display and reinforce a manner of thinking by race that was the source of the injustice and that will if it endures within our society be the  us     source of more injustice still the relevant proposition is not that it was blacks or jews or irish who were discriminated against but that it was individual men and women created equal who were discriminated against and the relevant resolve is that that should never happen again racial preferences appear to even the score in some small degree only if one embraces the proposition that our society is appropriately viewed as divided into races making it right that an injustice rendered in the past to a black man should be compensated for by discriminating against a white nothing is worth that embrace since blacks have been disproportionately disadvantaged by racial discrimination any raceneutral remedial program aimed at the disadvantaged as such will have a disproportionately beneficial impact on blacks only such a program and not one that operates on the basis of race is in accord with the letter and the spirit of our constitution since i believe that the appellee here had a constitutional right to have its bid succeed or fail under a decisionmaking process uninfected with racial bias i concur in the judgment of the court justice marshall with whom justice brennan and justice blackmun join dissenting it is a welcome symbol of racial progress when the former capital of the confederacy acts forthrightly to confront the effects of racial discrimination in its midst in my view nothing in the constitution can be construed to prevent richmond virginia from allocating a portion of its contracting dollars for businesses owned or controlled by members of minority groups indeed richmonds setaside program is indistinguishable in all meaningful respects from  and in fact was patterned upon  the federal setaside plan which this court upheld in fullilove v klutznick  us   a majority of this court holds today however that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment blocks richmonds initiative the essence of the majoritys  us     position  is that richmond has failed to catalog adequate findings to prove that past discrimination has impeded minorities from joining or participating fully in richmonds construction contracting industry i find deep irony in secondguessing richmonds judgment on this point as much as any municipality in the united states richmond knows what racial discrimination is a century of decisions by this and other federal courts has richly documented the citys disgraceful history of public and private racial discrimination in any event the richmond city council has supported its determination that minorities have been wrongly excluded from local construction contracting its proof includes statistics showing that minorityowned businesses have received virtually no city contracting dollars and rarely if ever belonged to area trade associations testimony by municipal officials that discrimination has been widespread in the local construction industry and the same exhaustive and widely publicized federal studies relied on in fullilove studies which showed that pervasive discrimination in the nations tightknit construction industry had operated to exclude minorities from public contracting these are precisely the types of statistical and testimonial evidence which until today this court had credited in cases approving of raceconscious measures designed to remedy past discrimination more fundamentally todays decision marks a deliberate and giant step backward in this courts affirmativeaction jurisprudence cynical of one municipalitys attempt to redress the effects of past racial discrimination in a particular industry the majority launches a grapeshot attack on raceconscious remedies in general the majoritys unnecessary pronouncements will inevitably discourage or prevent governmental entities particularly states and localities from acting to rectify the scourge of past discrimination this is  us     the harsh reality of the majoritys decision but it is not the constitutions command i as an initial matter the majority takes an exceedingly myopic view of the factual predicate on which the richmond city council relied when it passed the minority business utilization plan the majority analyzes richmonds initiative as if it were based solely upon the facts about local construction and contracting practices adduced during the city council session at which the measure was enacted ante at  in so doing the majority downplays the fact that the city council had before it a rich trove of evidence that discrimination in the nations construction industry had seriously impaired the competitive position of businesses owned or controlled by members of minority groups it is only against this backdrop of documented national discrimination however that the local evidence adduced by richmond can be properly understood the majoritys refusal to recognize that richmond has proved itself no exception to the dismaying pattern of national exclusion which congress so painstakingly identified infects its entire analysis of this case six years before richmond acted congress passed and the president signed the public works employment act of  pub l   stat   usc  et seq act a measure which appropriated  billion in federal grants to state and local governments for use in public works projects section f of the act was a minority business setaside provision it required state or local grantees to use  of their federal grants to procure services or supplies from businesses owned or controlled by members of statutorily identified minority groups absent an administrative waiver in  in fullilove supra this court upheld the validity of this federal setaside chief justice burgers principal opinion noted the importance of overcoming those criteria methods or practices thought by congress to have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing access  us     by the minority business community to public funds made available by congressional appropriations fullilove  us at   finding the setaside provision properly tailored to this goal the chief justice concluded that the program was valid under either strict or intermediate scrutiny id at  the congressional program upheld in fullilove was based upon an array of congressional and agency studies which documented the powerful influence of racially exclusionary practices in the business world a  report by the house committee on small business concluded the effects of past inequities stemming from racial prejudice have not remained in the past the congress has recognized the reality that past discriminatory practices have to some degree adversely affected our present economic system while minority persons comprise about  percent of the nations population of the  million businesses in the united states only  or approximately  percent are owned by minority individuals the most recent data from the department of commerce also indicates that the gross receipts of all businesses in this country totals about  billion and of this amount only  billion or about  percent was realized by minority business concerns these statistics are not the result of random chance the presumption must be made that past discriminatory systems have resulted in present economic inequities h r rep no  pp   quoted in fullilove supra at  opinion of burger c j emphasis deleted and added a  report by the same committee concluded over the years there has developed a business system which has traditionally excluded measurable minority participation in the past more than the present  us     this system of conducting business transactions overtly precluded minority input currently we more often encounter a business system which is racially neutral on its face but because of past overt social and economic discrimination is presently operating in effect to perpetuate these past inequities minorities until recently have not participated to any measurable extent in our total business system generally or in the construction industry in particular h r rep no  p   summarizing h r rep no  p   quoted in fullilove supra at  n  congress further found that minorities seeking initial public contracting assignments often faced immense entry barriers which did not confront experienced nonminority contractors a report submitted to congress in  by the united states commission on civil rights for example described the way in which fledgling minorityowned businesses were hampered by deficiencies in working capital inability to meet bonding requirements disabilities caused by an inadequate track record lack of awareness of bidding opportunities unfamiliarity with bidding procedures preselection before the formal advertising process and the exercise of discretion by government procurement officers to disfavor minority businesses fullilove supra at  summarizing united states commn on civil rights minorities and women as government contractors may  thus as of  there was abundant evidence in the public domain that minority businesses had been denied effective participation in public contracting opportunities by procurement practices that perpetuated the effects of prior discrimination fullilove supra at   significantly  us     this evidence demonstrated that discrimination had prevented existing or nascent minorityowned businesses from obtaining not only federal contracting assignments but state and local ones as well see fullilove supra at     the members of the richmond city council were well aware of these exhaustive congressional findings a point the  us     majority tellingly elides the transcript of the session at which the council enacted the local setaside initiative contains numerous references to the yearold congressional setaside program to the evidence of nationwide discrimination barriers described above and to the fullilove decision itself see e g app   remarks of city attorney william h hefty id at  remarks of councilmember william j leidinger id at  remarks of minority community task force president freddie ray id at   remarks of councilmember henry l marsh iii id at  remarks of city manager manuel deese the city councils members also heard testimony that although minority groups made up half of the citys population only  of the  million which richmond had dispensed in construction contracts during the five years ending in march  had gone to minorityowned prime contractors id at  remarks of councilmember henry w richardson they heard testimony that the major richmond area construction trade associations had virtually no minorities among their hundreds of members  finally they

supra at  marshall j dissenting fullilove  us at    us     marshall j concurring in judgment analyzed in terms of this twopronged standard richmonds setaside like the federal program on which it was modeled is plainly constitutional fullilove supra at  marshall j concurring in judgment a  turning first to the governmental interest inquiry richmond has two powerful interests in setting aside a portion of public contracting funds for minorityowned enterprises the first is the citys interest in eradicating the effects of past racial discrimination it is far too late in the day to doubt that remedying such discrimination is a compelling let alone an important interest in fullilove six members of this court deemed this interest sufficient to support a raceconscious setaside program governing federal contract procurement the decision in holding that the federal setaside provision satisfied the equal protection principles under any level of scrutiny recognized that the measure sought to remove barriers to competitive access which had their roots in racial and ethnic discrimination and which continue today even absent any intentional discrimination or unlawful conduct  us at   see also id at  powell j concurring id at  marshall j concurring in judgment indeed we have repeatedly reaffirmed the governments interest in breaking down barriers erected by past racial

prospective one of preventing the citys own spending decisions from reinforcing and perpetuating the exclusionary effects of past discrimination see fullilove  us at  noting congress conclusion that the subcontracting practices of prime contractors could perpetuate the prevailing impaired access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities id at  powell j concurring the majority pays only lipservice to this additional governmental interest see ante at   but our decisions have often emphasized the danger of the government tacitly adopting encouraging or furthering racial discrimination even by its own routine operations in shelley v kraemer  us   this court recognized this interest as a constitutional command holding unanimously that the equal protection clause forbids courts to enforce racially restrictive covenants even where such covenants satisfied all requirements of state law and where the state harbored no discriminatory intent similarly in norwood v harrison  us   we invalidated a program in which a state purchased textbooks and loaned them to students in public and private schools including private schools with racially discriminatory policies we stated that the constitution requires a state to steer clear not only of operating the old dual system of racially segregated schools but also of giving significant aid to institutions that practice racial or other invidious discrimination id at  see also gilmore v city of montgomery  us   upholding federalcourt order forbidding city to allow private segregated schools which allegedly discriminated on the basis of race to use public parks  us     the majority is wrong to trivialize the continuing impact of government acceptance or use of private institutions or structures once wrought by discrimination when government channels all its contracting funds to a whitedominated community of established contractors whose racial homogeneity is the product of private discrimination it does more than place its imprimatur on the practices which forged and which continue to define that community it also provides a measurable boost to those economic entities that have thrived within it while denying important economic benefits to those entities which but for prior discrimination might well be better qualified to receive valuable government contracts in my view the interest in ensuring that the government does not reflect and reinforce prior private discrimination in dispensing public contracts is every bit as strong as the interest in eliminating private discrimination  an interest which this court has repeatedly deemed compelling see e g new york state club assn v new york city  us    n   board of directors of rotary intl v rotary club of duarte  us    roberts v united states jaycees  us    bob jones university v united states  us    runyon v mccrary  us    the more government bestows its rewards on those persons or businesses that were positioned to thrive during a period of private racial discrimination the tighter the deadhand grip of prior discrimination becomes on the present and future cities like richmond may not be constitutionally required to adopt setaside plans but see north carolina bd of education v swann  us    constitution may require consideration of race in remedying statesponsored school segregation mcdaniel supra at  same and stating that any other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes but there can be no doubt that when richmond acted affirmatively to stem the perpetuation of patterns of discrimination through  us     its own decisionmaking it served an interest of the highest order  the remaining question with respect to the governmental interest prong of equal protection analysis is whether richmond has proffered satisfactory proof of past racial discrimination to support its twin interests in remediation and in governmental nonperpetuation although the members of this court have differed on the appropriate standard of review for raceconscious remedial measures see united states v paradise  us at   and  n  plurality opinion sheet metal workers v eeoc  us    plurality opinion we have always regarded this factual inquiry as a practical one thus the court has eschewed rigid tests which require the provision of particular species of evidence statistical or otherwise at the same time we have required that government adduce evidence that taken as a whole is sufficient to support its claimed interest and to dispel the natural concern that it acted out of mere paternalistic stereotyping not on a careful consideration of modern social conditions fullilove v klutznick supra at  marshall j concurring in judgment the separate opinions issued in wygant v jackson bd of education a case involving a school boards raceconscious layoff provision reflect this shared understanding justice powells opinion for a plurality of four justices stated that the trial court must make a factual determination that the employer had a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary  us at   justice oconnors separate concurrence required a firm basis for concluding that remedial action was appropriate id at  the dissenting opinion i authored joined by justices brennan and blackmun required a government body to present a legitimate factual predicate and a reviewing court to genuinely consider the circumstances of the provision at issue id at   finally justice  us     stevens separate dissent sought and found a rational and unquestionably legitimate basis for the school boards action id at  our unwillingness to go beyond these generalized standards to require specific types of proof in all circumstances reflects in my view an understanding that discrimination takes a myriad of ingenious and pervasive forms university of california regents v bakke  us at  separate opinion of marshall j the varied body of evidence on which richmond relied provides a strong firm and unquestionably legitimate basis upon which the city council could determine that the effects of past racial discrimination warranted a remedial and prophylactic governmental response as i have noted supra at  richmond acted against a backdrop of congressional and executive branch studies which demonstrated with such force the nationwide pervasiveness of prior discrimination that congress presumed that present economic inequities in construction contracting resulted from past discriminatory systems supra at  quoting h r rep no  pp   the citys local evidence confirmed that richmonds construction industry did not deviate from this pernicious national pattern the fact that just  of public construction expenditures over the previous five years had gone to minorityowned prime contractors despite the citys racially mixed population strongly suggests that construction contracting in the area was rife with present economic inequities to the extent this enormous disparity did not itself demonstrate that discrimination had occurred the descriptive testimony of richmonds elected and appointed leaders drew the necessary link between the pitifully small presence of minorities in construction contracting and past exclusionary practices that no one who testified challenged this depiction of widespread racial discrimination in area construction contracting lent significant weight to these accounts the fact that area trade associations had virtually no minority members dramatized the extent of present  us     inequities and suggested the lasting power of past discriminatory systems in sum to suggest that the facts on which richmond has relied do not provide a sound basis for its finding of past racial discrimination simply blinks credibility richmonds reliance on localized industryspecific findings is a far cry from the reliance on generalized societal discrimination which the majority decries as a basis for remedial action ante at    but characterizing the plight of richmonds minority contractors as mere societal discrimination is not the only respect in which the majoritys critique shows an unwillingness to come to grips with why constructioncontracting in richmond is essentially a whitesonly enterprise the majority also takes the disingenuous approach of disaggregating richmonds local evidence attacking it piecemeal and thereby concluding that no single piece of evidence adduced by the city standing alone see e g ante at  suffices to prove past discrimination but items of evidence do not of course stand alone or exist in alien juxtaposition they necessarily work together reinforcing or contradicting each other in any event the majoritys criticisms of individual items of richmonds evidence rest on flimsy foundations the majority states for example that reliance on the disparity between the share of city contracts awarded to minority firms  and the minority population of richmond approximately  is misplaced ante at  it is true that when the factual predicate needed to be proved is one of present discrimination we have generally credited statistical contrasts between the racial composition of a work force and the general population as proving discrimination only where this contrast revealed gross statistical disparities hazelwood school dist v united states  us     title vii case see also teamsters v united states  us    same but this principle does not impugn richmonds statistical contrast for two reasons first considering how minuscule the share of richmond public  us     construction contracting dollars received by minorityowned businesses is it is hardly unreasonable to conclude that this case involves a gross statistical disparity hazelwood school dist supra at  there are roughly equal numbers of minorities and nonminorities in richmond  yet minorityowned businesses receive oneseventyfifth of the public contracting funds that other businesses receive see teamsters supra at  n  fine tuning of the statistics could not have obscured the glaring absence of minority bus drivers    the companys inability to rebut the inference of discrimination came not from a misuse of statistics but from the inexorable zero citation omitted quoted in johnson v transportation agency santa clara county  us     oconnor j concurring in judgment second and more fundamentally where the issue is not present discrimination but rather whether past discrimination has resulted in the continuing exclusion of minorities from a historically tightknit industry a contrast between population and work force is entirely appropriate to help gauge the degree of the exclusion in johnson v transportation agency santa clara county supra justice oconnor specifically observed that when it is alleged that discrimination has prevented blacks from obtaining the experience needed to qualify for a position the relevant comparison is not to the percentage of blacks in the pool of qualified candidates but to the total percentage of blacks in the labor force id at  see also steelworkers v weber  us    and n   teamsters supra at  n  this contrast is especially illuminating in cases like this where a main avenue of introduction into the work force  here membership in the trade associations whose members presumably train apprentices and help them procure subcontracting assignments  is itself grossly dominated by nonminorities the majoritys assertion that the city does not even know how many mbes in the relevant market are qualified ante at  is thus entirely beside the  us     point if richmond indeed has a monochromatic contracting community  a conclusion reached by the district court see civ action no  ed va  reprinted in supp app to juris statement   this most likely reflects the lingering power of past exclusionary practices certainly this is the explanation congress has found persuasive at the national level see fullilove  us at   the citys requirement that prime public contractors set aside  of their subcontracting assignments for minorityowned enterprises subject to the ordinances provision for waivers where minorityowned enterprises are unavailable or unwilling to participate is designed precisely to ease minority contractors into the industry the majoritys perfunctory dismissal of the testimony of richmonds appointed and elected leaders is also deeply disturbing these officials  including councilmembers a former mayor and the present city manager  asserted that race discrimination in area contracting had been widespread and that the setaside ordinance was a sincere and necessary attempt to eradicate the effects of this discrimination the majority however states that where racial classifications are concerned simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot suffice ante at  it similarly discounts as minimally probative the city councils designation of its setaside plan as remedial blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements the majority explains has no place in equal protection analysis ante at  no one of course advocates blind judicial deference to the findings of the city council or the testimony of city leaders the majoritys suggestion that wholesale deference is what richmond seeks is a classic strawman argument but the majoritys trivialization of the testimony of richmonds leaders is dismaying in a far more serious respect by disregarding the testimony of local leaders and the judgment of local government the majority does violence to the very principles of comity within our federal system which this  us     court has long championed local officials by virtue of their proximity to and their expertise with local affairs are exceptionally well qualified to make determinations of public good within their respective spheres of authority hawaii housing authority v midkiff  us    see also ferc v mississippi  us     oconnor j concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part the majority however leaves any traces of comity behind in its headlong rush to strike down richmonds raceconscious measure had the majority paused for a moment on the facts of the richmond experience it would have discovered that the citys leadership is deeply familiar with what racial discrimination is the members of the richmond city council have spent long years witnessing multifarious acts of discrimination including but not limited to the deliberate diminution of black residents voting rights resistance to school desegregation and publicly sanctioned housing discrimination numerous decisions of federal courts chronicle this disgraceful recent history in richmond v united states  us   for example this court denounced richmonds decision to annex part of an adjacent county at a time when the citys black population was nearing  because it was infected by the impermissible purpose of denying the right to vote based on race through perpetuating white majority power to exclude negroes from office id at  see also id at  brennan j dissenting describing richmonds flagrantly discriminatory purpose    to avert a transfer of political control to what was fast becoming a blackpopulation majority citation omitted    in bradley v school bd of richmond  fd   n  ca  affd by an equally divided court  us

recorded in the opinions of this and other courts and need not be repeated in detail here it suffices to say that there was massive resistance and every state resource including the services of the legal officers of the state the services of private counsel costing the state hundreds of thousands of dollars the state police and the power and prestige of the governor was employed to defeat brown

omitted the court of appeals majority in bradley used equally pungent words in describing public and private housing discrimination in richmond though rejecting the black plaintiffs request that it consolidate richmonds school district with those of two neighboring counties the majority nonetheless agreed with the plaintiffs assertion that within the city of richmond there has been state also federal action tending to perpetuate apartheid of the races in ghetto patterns throughout the city id at  citing numerous public and private acts of discrimination     us     when the legislatures and leaders of cities with histories of pervasive discrimination testify that past discrimination has infected one of their industries armchair cynicism like that exercised by the majority has no place it may well be that the autonomy of a state is an essential component of federalism garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority  us    oconnor j dissenting and that each state is sovereign within its own domain governing its citizens and providing for their general welfare ferc v mississippi supra at  oconnor j dissenting but apparently this is not the case when federal judges with nothing but their impressions to go on choose to disbelieve the explanations of these local governments and officials disbelief is particularly inappropriate here in light of the fact that appellee croson which had the burden of proving unconstitutionality at trial wygant  us at   plurality opinion has at no point come forward with any direct evidence that the city councils motives were anything other than sincere    finally i vehemently disagree with the majoritys dismissal of the congressional and executive branch findings  us     noted in fullilove as having extremely limited probative value in this case ante at  the majority concedes that congress established nothing less than a presumption that minority contracting firms have been disadvantaged by prior discrimination ibid the majority inexplicably would forbid richmond to share in this information and permit only congress to take note of these ample findings ante at  in thus requiring that richmonds local evidence be severed from the context in which it was prepared the majority would require cities seeking to eradicate the effects of past discrimination within their borders to reinvent the evidentiary wheel and engage in unnecessarily duplicative costly and timeconsuming factfinding no principle of federalism or of federal power however forbids a state or local government to draw upon a nationally relevant historical record prepared by the federal government see renton v playtime theatres inc  us     city is entitled to rely on the experiences of seattle and other cities in enacting an adult theater ordinance as the first amendment does not require a city    to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities so long as whatever evidence the cities relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses see also steelworkers v weber  us at   n  judicial findings of exclusion from crafts on racial grounds are so numerous as to make such exclusion a proper subject for judicial notice cf wygant supra at  marshall j dissenting no raceconscious provision that purports to serve a remedial purpose can be fairly assessed in a vacuum  of course richmond could have built an even more  us     compendious record of past discrimination one including additional stark statistics and additional individual accounts of past discrimination but nothing in the fourteenth amendment imposes such onerous documentary obligations upon states and localities once the reality of past discrimination is apparent see infra at  b in my judgment richmonds setaside plan also comports with the second prong of the equal protection inquiry for it is substantially related to the interests it seeks to serve in remedying past discrimination and in ensuring that municipal contract procurement does not perpetuate that discrimination the most striking aspect of the citys ordinance is the similarity it bears to the appropriately limited federal setaside provision upheld in fullilove  us at   like the federal provision richmonds is limited to five years in duration ibid and was not renewed when it came up for reconsideration in  like the federal provision richmonds contains a waiver provision freeing from its subcontracting requirements those nonminority firms that demonstrate that they cannot comply with its provisions id at  like the federal provision richmonds has a minimal impact on innocent third parties while the measure affects  of public contracting dollars that translates to only  us      of overall richmond area contracting brief for appellant  n  recounting federal census figures on construction in richmond see fullilove supra at  burden shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light compared to overall construction contracting opportunities finally like the federal provision richmonds does not interfere with any vested right of a contractor to a particular contract instead it operates entirely prospectively  us at   richmonds initiative affects only future economic arrangements and imposes only a diffuse burden on nonminority competitors  here businesses owned or controlled by nonminorities which seek subcontracting work on public construction projects the plurality in wygant emphasized the importance of not disrupting the settled and legitimate expectations of innocent parties while hiring goals impose a diffuse burden often foreclosing only one of several opportunities layoffs impose the entire burden of achieving racial equality on particular individuals often resulting in serious disruption of their lives that burden is too intrusive wygant  us at   see steelworkers v weber supra at  these factors far from justifying a preference of any size or duration ante at  are precisely the factors to which this court looked in fullilove the majority takes issue however with two aspects of richmonds tailoring the citys refusal to explore the use of raceneutral measures to increase minority business participation in contracting ante at  and the selection of a  setaside figure ante at  the majoritys first criticism is flawed in two respects first the majority overlooks the fact that since  richmond has barred both discrimination by the city in awarding public contracts and discrimination by public contractors see richmond va city code  et seq  the virtual absence of minority businesses from the citys contracting rolls indicated by the fact that such businesses have received less than  of public contracting dollars  us     strongly suggests that this ban has not succeeded in redressing the impact of past discrimination or in preventing city contract procurement from reinforcing racial homogeneity second the majoritys suggestion that richmond should have first undertaken such raceneutral measures as a program of city financing for small firms ante at  ignores the fact that such measures while theoretically appealing have been discredited by congress as ineffectual in eradicating the effects of past discrimination in this very industry for this reason this court in fullilove refused to fault congress for not undertaking raceneutral measures as precursors to its raceconscious setaside see fullilove  us at   noting inadequacy of previous measures designed to give experience to minority businesses see also id at  powell j concurring by the time congress enacted the federal setaside in  it knew that other remedies had failed to ameliorate the effects of racial discrimination in the construction industry the equal protection clause does not require richmond to retrace congress steps when congress has found that those steps lead nowhere given the wellexposed limitations of raceneutral measures it was thus appropriate for a municipality like richmond to conclude that in the words of justice blackmun in order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race there is no other way university of california regents v bakke  us at  separate opinion     us     as for richmonds  target the majority states that this figure cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal except perhaps outright racial balancing ante at  the majority ignores two important facts first the setaside measure affects only  of overall city contracting thus any imprecision in tailoring has far less impact than the majority suggests but more important the majority ignores the fact that richmonds  figure was patterned directly on the fullilove precedent congress  figure fell roughly halfway between the present percentage of minority contractors and the percentage of minority group members in the nation fullilove supra at  powell j concurring the richmond city councils  figure similarly falls roughly halfway between the present percentage of richmondbased minority contractors almost zero and the percentage of minorities in richmond  in faulting richmond for not presenting a different explanation for its choice of a setaside figure the majority honors fullilove only in the breach iii i would ordinarily end my analysis at this point and conclude that richmonds ordinance satisfies both the governmental interest and substantial relationship prongs of our equal protection clause analysis however i am compelled to add more for the majority has gone beyond the facts of this case to announce a set of principles which unnecessarily restricts the power of governmental entities to take raceconscious measures to redress the effects of prior discrimination a today for the first time a majority of this court has adopted strict scrutiny as its standard of equal protection clause review of raceconscious remedial measures ante at  ante at  scalia j concurring in judgment this is an unwelcome development a profound difference separates governmental actions that themselves are racist  us     and governmental actions that seek to remedy the effects of prior racism or to prevent neutral governmental activity from perpetuating the effects of such racism see e g wygant v jackson bd of education  us at   marshall j dissenting fullilove supra at  marshall j concurring in judgment university of california regents v bakke  us at   joint opinion of brennan white marshall and blackmun jj racial classifications drawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government behind racial hatred and separatism warrant the strictest judicial scrutiny because of the very irrelevance of these rationales id at  by contrast racial classifications drawn for the purpose of remedying the effects of discrimination that itself was race based have a highly pertinent basis the tragic and indelible fact that discrimination against blacks and other racial minorities in this nation has pervaded our nations history and continues to scar our society as i stated in fullilove because the consideration of race is relevant to remedying the continuing effects of past racial discrimination and because governmental programs employing racial classifications for remedial purposes can be crafted to avoid stigmatization    such programs should not be subjected to conventional strict scrutiny  scrutiny that is strict in theory but fatal in fact fullilove supra at  citation omitted in concluding that remedial classifications warrant no different standard of review under the constitution than the most brutal and repugnant forms of statesponsored racism a majority of this court signals that it regards racial discrimination as largely a phenomenon of the past and that government bodies need no longer preoccupy themselves with rectifying racial injustice i however do not believe this nation is anywhere close to eradicating racial discrimination or its vestiges in constitutionalizing its wishful thinking  us     the majority today does a grave disservice not only to those victims of past and present racial discrimination in this nation whom government has sought to assist but also to this courts long tradition of approaching issues of race with the utmost sensitivity b i am also troubled by the majoritys assertion that even if it did not believe generally in strict scrutiny of racebased remedial measures the circumstances of this case require this court to look upon the richmond city councils measure with the strictest scrutiny ante at  the sole such circumstance which the majority cites however is the fact that blacks in richmond are a dominant racial group in the city ibid in support of this characterization of dominance the majority observes that blacks constitute approximately  of the population of the city of richmond and that five of the nine seats on the city council are held by blacks ibid while i agree that the numerical and political supremacy of a given racial group is a factor bearing upon the level of scrutiny to be applied this court has never held that numerical inferiority standing alone makes a racial group suspect and thus entitled to strict scrutiny review rather we have identified other traditional indicia of suspectness whether a group has been saddled with such disabilities or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process san antonio independent school dist v rodriguez  us    it cannot seriously be suggested that nonminorities in richmond have any history of purposeful unequal treatment ibid nor is there any indication that they have any of the disabilities that have characteristically afflicted those groups this court has deemed suspect indeed the numerical and political dominance of nonminorities within  us     the state of virginia and the nation as a whole provides an enormous political check against the simple racial politics at the municipal level which the majority fears ante at  if the majority really believes that groups like richmonds nonminorities which constitute approximately half the population but which are outnumbered even marginally in political fora are deserving of suspect class status for these reasons alone this courts decisions denying suspect status to women see craig v boren  us    and to persons with belowaverage incomes see san antonio independent school dist supra at  stand on extremely shaky ground see castaneda v partida  us    marshall j concurring in my view the circumstances of this case ante at  underscore the importance of not subjecting to a strict scrutiny straitjacket the increasing number of cities which have recently come under minority leadership and are eager to rectify or at least prevent the perpetuation of past racial discrimination in many cases these cities will be the ones with the most in the way of prior discrimination to rectify richmonds leaders had just witnessed decades of publicly sanctioned racial discrimination in virtually all walks of life  discrimination amply documented in the decisions of the federal judiciary see supra at  this history of purposefully unequal treatment forced upon minorities not imposed by them should raise an inference that minorities in richmond had much to remedy  and that the  setaside was undertaken with sincere remedial goals in mind not simple racial politics ante at  richmonds own recent political history underscores the facile nature of the majoritys assumption that elected officials voting decisions are based on the color of their skins in recent years white and black councilmembers in richmond have increasingly joined hands on controversial matters when the richmond city council elected a black man mayor in  for example his victory was won with the  us     support of the city councils four white members richmond timesdispatch july   p  col  the vote on the setaside plan a year later also was not purely along racial lines of the four white councilmembers one voted for the measure and another abstained app  the majoritys view that remedial measures undertaken by municipalities with black leadership must face a stiffer test of equal protection clause scrutiny than remedial measures undertaken by municipalities with white leadership implies a lack of political maturity on the part of this nations elected minority officials that is totally unwarranted such insulting judgments have no place in constitutional jurisprudence c todays decision finally is particularly noteworthy for the daunting standard it imposes upon states and localities contemplating the use of raceconscious measures to eradicate the present effects of prior discrimination and prevent its perpetuation the majority restricts the use of such measures to situations in which a state or locality can put forth a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation ante at  in so doing the majority calls into question the validity of the business setasides which dozens of municipalities across this nation have adopted on the authority of fullilove nothing in the constitution or in the prior decisions of this court supports limiting state authority to confront the effects of past discrimination to those situations in which a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation can be made out by its very terms the majoritys standard effectively cedes control of a large component of the content of that constitutional provision to congress and to state legislatures if an antecedent virginia or richmond law had defined as unlawful the award to nonminorities of an overwhelming share of a citys contracting dollars for example richmonds subsequent setaside initiative would then satisfy  us     the majoritys standard but without such a law the initiative might not withstand constitutional scrutiny the meaning of equal protection of the laws thus turns on the happenstance of whether a state or local body has previously defined illegal discrimination indeed given that racially discriminatory cities may be the ones least likely to have tough antidiscrimination laws on their books the majoritys constitutional incorporation of state and local statutes has the perverse effect of inhibiting those states or localities with the worst records of official racism from taking remedial action similar flaws would inhere in the majoritys standard even if it incorporated only federal antidiscrimination statutes if congress tomorrow dramatically expanded title vii of the civil rights act of   stat  as amended  usc e et seq  or alternatively if it repealed that legislation altogether  the meaning of equal protection would change precipitately along with it whatever the framers of the fourteenth amendment had in mind in  it certainly was not that the content of their amendment would turn on the amendments to or the evolving interpretations of a federal statute passed nearly a century later     us     to the degree that this parsimonious standard is grounded on a view that either  or  of the fourteenth amendment substantially disempowered states and localities from remedying past racial discrimination ante at   the majority is seriously mistaken with respect first to  our precedents have never suggested that this provision  or for that matter its companion federalempowerment provisions in the thirteenth and fifteenth amendments  was meant to preempt or limit state police power to undertake raceconscious remedial measures to the contrary in katzenbach v morgan  us   we held that  is a positive grant of legislative power authorizing congress to exercise its discretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment id at  emphasis added see id at  south carolina v katzenbach  us     interpreting similar provision of the fifteenth amendment to empower congress to implement the rights created by its passage see also city of rome v  us     united states  us    same indeed we have held that congress has this authority even where no constitutional violation has been found see katzenbach v morgan supra upholding voting rights act provision nullifying state english literacy requirement we had previously upheld against equal protection clause challenge certainly fullilove did not view  either as limiting the traditionally broad police powers of the states to fight discrimination or as mandating a zerosum game in which state power wanes as federal power waxes on the contrary the fullilove plurality invoked  only because it provided specific and certain authorization for the federal governments attempt to impose a raceconscious condition on the dispensation of federal funds by state and local grantees see fullilove  us at  basing decision on  because in certain contexts there are limitations on the reach of the commerce power as for  it is too late in the day to assert seriously that the equal protection clause prohibits states  or for that matter the federal government to whom the equal protection guarantee has largely been applied see bolling v sharpe  us    from enacting raceconscious remedies our cases in the areas of school desegregation voting rights and affirmative action have demonstrated time and again that race is constitutionally germane precisely because race remains dismayingly relevant in american life in adopting its prima facie standard for states and localities the majority closes its eyes to this constitutional history and social reality so too does justice scalia he would further limit consideration of race to those cases in which states find it necessary to eliminate their own maintenance of a system of unlawful racial classification  a distinction which he states explains our school desegregation cases ante at  scalia j concurring in judgment but this courts remedystage school desegregation decisions cannot so conveniently be cordoned off these decisions like those involving voting rights and affirmative action  us     stand for the same broad principles of equal protection which richmond seeks to vindicate in this case all persons have equal worth and it is permissible given a sufficient factual predicate and appropriate tailoring for government to take account of race to eradicate the present effects of racebased subjugation denying that basic equality justice scalias artful distinction allows him to avoid having to repudiate our school desegregation cases ibid but like the arbitrary limitation on raceconscious relief adopted by the majority his approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of the remedial actions of states and localities mcdaniel v barresi  us at   see also north carolina bd of education v swann  us at  striking down states flat prohibition on assignment of pupils on basis of race as impeding an effective remedy united jewish organizations v carey  us     upholding new yorks use of racial criteria in drawing district lines so as to comply with  of the voting rights act the fact is that congress concern in passing the reconstruction amendments and particularly their congressional authorization provisions was that states would not adequately respond to racial violence or discrimination against newly freed slaves to interpret any aspect of these amendments as proscribing state remedial responses to these very problems turns the amendments on their heads as four justices of whom i was one stated in university of california regents v bakke there is no reason to conclude that the states cannot voluntarily accomplish under  of the fourteenth amendment what congress under  of the fourteenth amendment validly may authorize or compel either the states or private persons to do a contrary position would conflict with the traditional understanding recognizing the competence of the states to initiate measures consistent with federal policy in the absence of congressional preemption of the subject matter nothing  us     whatever in the legislative history of either the fourteenth amendment or the civil rights acts even remotely suggests that the states are foreclosed from furthering the fundamental purpose of equal opportunity to which the amendment and those acts are addressed indeed voluntary initiatives by the states to achieve the national goal of equal opportunity have been recognized to be essential to its attainment to use the fourteenth amendment as a sword against such state power would stultify that amendment railway mail assn v corsi  us   frankfurter j concurring  us at  footnote omitted emphasis added in short there is simply no credible evidence that the framers of the fourteenth amendment sought to transfer the security and protection of all the civil rights    from the states to the federal government the slaughterhouse cases  wall     the three reconstruction amendments undeniably worked a dramatic change in the balance between congressional and state power ante at  they forbade statesanctioned slavery forbade the statesanctioned denial of the right to vote and until the content of the equal protection clause was substantially applied to the federal government through the due process clause of the fifth amendment uniquely forbade states to deny equal protection the amendments also specifically empowered the federal government to combat discrimination at a time when the breadth of federal power under the constitution was less apparent than it is today but nothing in the amendments themselves or in our long history of interpreting or applying those momentous charters suggests that  us     states exercising their police power are in any way constitutionally inhibited from working alongside the federal government in the fight against discrimination and its effects iv the majority today sounds a fullscale retreat from the courts longstanding solicitude to raceconscious remedial efforts

blacks among its  richmond members id at  remarks of patrick murphy the professional contractors estimators association had  black member among its  richmond members id at  remarks of al shuman the central virginia electrical contractors association had  black member among its  members id at  remarks of al shuman and the national electrical contractors association had  black members among its  virginia members id at  remarks of mark singer  footnote   among those testifying to the discriminatory practices of richmonds construction industry was councilmember henry marsh who had served as mayor of richmond from  to  marsh stated i have been practicing law in this community since  and i am familiar with the practices in the construction industry in this area in the state  us     and around the nation and i can say without equivocation that the general conduct in the construction industry in this area and the state and around the nation is one in which race discrimination and exclusion on the basis of race is widespread i think the situation involved in the city of richmond is the same     i think the question of whether or not remedial action is required is not open to question id at  manuel deese who in his capacity as city manager had oversight responsibility for city procurement matters stated that he fully agreed with marshs analysis id at   footnote   the representatives of several trade associations did however deny that their particular organizations engaged in discrimination see e g id at  remarks of al shuman on behalf of the central virginia electrical contractors association  footnote   for a disturbing description of the lengths to which some richmond white officials went during recent decades to hold in check growing black political power see j moeser  r dennis the politics of annexation  oligarchic power in a southern city    footnote   again the dissenting judge  who would have consolidated the school districts  elaborated many other instances of state and private action contributed to the concentration of black citizens within richmond and white citizens without these were principally in the area of residential development racially restrictive convenants were freely employed racially discriminatory  us     practices in the prospective purchase of county property by black purchasers were followed urban renewal subsidized public housing and governmentsponsored home mortgage insurance had been undertaken on a racially discriminatory basis the neighboring counties provided schools roads zoning and development approval for the rapid growth of the white population in each county at the expense of the city without making any attempt to assure that the development that they made possible was integrated superimposed on the pattern of governmentaided residential segregation    had been a discriminatory policy of school construction i e the selection of school construction sites in the center of racially identifiable neighborhoods manifestly to serve the educational needs of students of a single race the majority does not question the accuracy of these facts  fd at  winter j emphasis in original footnote omitted  footnote   cf fullilove v klutznick  us    stevens j dissenting noting statements of sponsors of federal setaside that measure was designed to give their constituents a piece of the action  footnote   although the majority sharply criticizes richmond for using data which it did not itself develop it is noteworthy that the federal setaside program upheld in fullilove was adopted as a floor amendment without any congressional hearings or investigation whatsoever l tribe american constitutional law  d ed  the principal opinion in fullilove  us     justified the setaside by relying heavily on the aforementioned studies by agencies like the small business administration and on legislative reports prepared in connection with prior failed legislation see fullilove v klutznick  us at  opinion of burger c j although the act recites no preambulary findings on the subject we are satisfied that congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices when applied to minority businesses could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination see also id at  and n  stevens j dissenting noting perfunctory consideration accorded the setaside provision days fullilove  yale l j    one can only marvel at the fact that the minority setaside provision was enacted into law without hearings or committee reports and with only token opposition citation and footnote omitted  footnote   the majority also faults richmonds ordinance for including within its definition of minority group members not only black citizens but also citizens who are spanishspeaking oriental indian eskimo or aleut persons ante at  this is of course precisely the same definition congress adopted in its setaside legislation fullilove supra at  even accepting the majoritys view that richmonds ordinance is overbroad because it includes groups such as eskimos or aleuts about whom no evidence of local discrimination has been proffered it does not necessarily follow that the balance of richmonds ordinance should be invalidated  footnote   although the majority purports to adhere to the standard of review employed in wygant ante at  the prima facie case standard it adopts marks an implicit rejection of the more generally framed strong basis in evidence test endorsed by the wygant v jackson bd of education  us   plurality and the similar firm basis test endorsed by justice oconnor in her separate concurrence in that case see id at  id at  under those tests proving a prima facie violation of title vii would appear to have been but one means of adducing sufficient proof to satisfy equal protection clause analysis see johnson v transportation agency santa clara county  us    plurality opinion criticizing suggestion that raceconscious relief be conditioned on showing of a prima facie title vii violation the rhetoric of todays majority opinion departs from wygant in another significant respect in wygant a majority of this court rejected as unduly inhibiting and constitutionally unsupported a requirement that a municipality demonstrate that its remedial plan is designed only to benefit specific victims of discrimination see  us at   id at   us     oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment id at  marshall j dissenting justice oconnor noted the courts general agreement that a remedial purpose need not be accompanied by contemporaneous findings of actual discrimination to be accepted as legitimate as long as the public actor has a firm basis for believing that remedial action is required    a plan need not be limited to the remedying of specific instances of identified discrimination for it to be deemed sufficiently narrowly tailored or substantially related to the correction of prior discrimination by the state actor id at  the majoritys opinion today however hints that a specific victims proof requirement might be appropriate in equal protection cases see e g ante at  states and localities must identify that discrimination    with some specificity given that just three terms ago this court rejected the specific victims idea as untenable i believe these references  and the majoritys cryptic identified discrimination requirement  cannot be read to require states and localities to make such highly particularized showings rather i take the majoritys standard of identified discrimination merely to require some quantum of proof of discrimination within a given jurisdiction that exceeds the proof which richmond has put forth here  footnote   tellingly the sole support the majority offers for its view that the framers of the fourteenth amendment intended such a result are two law review articles analyzing this courts recent affirmativeaction decisions and a court of appeals decision which relies upon statements by james madison ante at  madison of course had been dead for  years when the fourteenth amendment was enacted justice blackmun with whom justice brennan joins dissenting i join justice marshalls perceptive and incisive opinion revealing great sensitivity toward those who have suffered the pains of economic discrimination in the construction trades for so long i never thought that i would live to see the day when the city of richmond virginia the cradle of the old confederacy sought on its own within a narrow confine to lessen the stark impact of persistent discrimination but richmond to its great credit acted yet this court the supposed bastion of equality strikes down richmonds efforts as though discrimination had never existed or was not demonstrated in this particular litigation justice marshall convincingly discloses the fallacy and the shallowness of that approach history is irrefutable even though one might sympathize with those who  though possibly innocent in themselves  benefit from the wrongs of past decades  us     so the court today regresses i am confident however that given time it one day again will do its best to fulfill the great promises of the constitutions preamble and of the guarantees embodied in the bill of rights  a fulfillment that would make this nation very special  us     findlaw career center attorney corporate
