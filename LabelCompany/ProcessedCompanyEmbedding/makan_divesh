accounting firm arthur andersen the divisions origins are in a  feasibility study for general electric ge asked arthur andersen to automate payroll processing and manufacturing at ges appliance park facility near louisville kentucky arthur andersen recommended installation of a univac i computer and printer which resulted in the first commerciallyowned computer installation in the united states in  joe glickauf an early pioneer of computer consulting held a position as head of arthur andersens administrative services division for  years in  arthur andersen and andersen consulting became separate units of andersen worldwide société coopérative arthur andersen increased its use of accounting services as a springboard to sign up clients for andersen consultings more lucrative business through the s there was increasing tension between andersen consulting and arthur andersen andersen consulting was upset that it was paying arthur andersen up to  of its profits each year a condition of the  split was that the more profitable unit – aa or ac – paid the other this sum while at the same time arthur andersen was competing with andersen consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called arthur andersen business consulting this dispute came to a head in  when andersen consulting claimed breach of contract against andersen worldwide société coopérative awsc and arthur andersen andersen consulting put the  transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract in august  as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the international chamber of commerce andersen consulting broke all contractual ties with awsc and arthur andersen as part of the arbitration settlement andersen consulting paid the sum held in escrow then  billion to arthur andersen and was required to change its name resulting in the entity being renamed accenture accounts vary on why the split occurred – executives on both sides of the split cite greed and arrogance on the part of the other side and executives on the andersen consulting side maintained breach of contract when arthur andersen created a second consulting group aabc arthur andersen business consulting that began to compete directly with andersen consulting in the marketplace many of the aabc firms were bought out by other consulting companies in  most notably hitachi consulting and kpmg consulting which later changed its name to bearingpoint andersen consultings change of name proved to be fortuitous as it avoided damage to its reputation when arthur andersen was effectively dissolved as a result of its role in the later enron scandal boards  committees corporate boards ▾ president of the board current oneprojectorg one

gained entry into zuckerbergs inner circle  forbes india full list » m india adani ports and special economic zone ajanta pharma alembic pharmaceuticals amara raja batteries ashok leyland asian paints aurobindo pharma bajaj finance berger paints india trending  q earnings  home global game cross border how divesh makan gained entry into zuckerbergs inner circle not all financial advisors are created equal meet divesh makan consigliere to silicon valleys brightest billionaires by brian solomon published jan     image agata nowicka for forbes in the hierarchy of the investment business stockbrokers have long occupied a spot near the bottom of the food chain they are the hunters and gatherers knocking on doors to bring in assets that earn small fees while the bigger fish arrange the headlinegrabbing deals and score lifechanging bonusesbut among the throngs of brokers who now prefer the moniker “wealth manager” few have cultivated a client base and model like iconiq capital an obscure silicon valley firm headed by an irrepressible indian from south africa named divesh makan makan  has turned his otherwise runofthemill registered investment advisory into an exclusive membersonly silicon valley billionaires club that operates as a cross between a family office and a venture capital fund his most famous client and the key to his success is billionaire facebook founder mark zuckerberg whom makan met in  when he was a broker at goldman sachsworking his way into zuckerberg’s inner circle when facebook was still in diapers has proved to be a gold mine for iconiq already it has full discretion over  billion in client funds and advises on another  billion yet iconiq’s advisory services represent only one thread of the dealmaking web makan has woven thanks to the abundance of zuckerberg cronies on his client roster including facebook’s dustin moskovitz and sheryl sandberg twitter’s jack dorsey and linkedin’s reid hoffman his board of directors is another power list with nontech titans like henry kravis and david bonderman chase coleman and steel tycoon lakshmi mittal’s son adityamakan’s wealth management approach flies in the face of widely accepted postmadoff best practices for advisors which preach strict adherence to corporate protocols and regulatory rules he is a throwback to the early days of wall street when dealmakers like goldman sachs’ sidney weinberg blurred the lines between business and pleasure and turned the art of schmoozing into a powerful and profitable investment banking network indeed makan shuns the title of wealth manager according to those who have worked with him he sees himself instead as part doitall financial consigliere part deal brokerventure capitalist and part human rolodex makan’s currency is access and relevance while silicon valley stalwarts like sequoia and benchmark can point to a long list of successful ipos and a deep bench of management experts he hawks the “zuck  friends” brand to piece together deals between young startup entrepreneurs and billionaire sugar daddies as well as between the billionaires themselves the centrepiece of this action is iconiq’s  million strategic partners fund makan’s flagship among  private investment vehicles which total about  billion the firm claims only  family office clients but regulatory forms report some  investors who put preipo money into such companies as alibaba and india’s ecommerce giant flipkart key to makan’s pitch is bowling over wannabe zuckerbergs with raw star power before iconiq led a  million series d round last may for social media software firm sprinklr makan invited founder ragy thomas to dinner with three famous billionaires“when someone like iconiq wants to invest you can’t say no” says thomas “they can probably connect to anyone in the world” aaron skonnard cofounder of elearning startup pluralsight received a similar “join silicon valley’s inner circle” pitch from makan before iconiq participated in the firm’s  million series b round“they don’t want operational involvement” says skonnard “they just want to connect and network and give more access” he and his wife recently flew in to san francisco from their home in salt lake city for a quarterly iconiq networking event “where all the magic happens” while makan and his team sell entrepreneurs on access to its famous clients they sell other connections on getting in on the ground floor of hot startups billionaire moguls like sam zell and li kashing have massive real estate portfolios but no direct link to the silicon valley incrowd through iconiq they have gained access to startups that makan  co advertise as being “approved by zuckerberg” what does makan ask for in return opportunities for his clients to invest alongside zell and li in their deal flowsas a registered investment advisor makan has a fiduciary duty to “not engage in any activity in conflict with the interest of any client” but unlike your average merrill broker who faces a gauntlet of compliance hurdles on every product mentioned iconiq deals practically advertise their dizzying array of conflicts of interest take iconiq’s  investment in surveymonkey in which makan blurred the lines between investment advisor limited partner and friend he put clients like dropbox’s drew houston quora’s adam d’angelo and linkedin’s jeff weiner in the  million round but surveymonkey ceo dave goldberg and his wife facebook exec sandberg are also clients and confidants of makan and goldberg sits on iconiq’s board the sec frowns on advisors engaging in such conflicts but will tolerate it as long as it’s disclosedlike other wealth managers iconiq charges percentageofassets fees up to  percent on allocations in stocks bonds and etfs but it takes additional performance fees of  percent to  percent on venture fund profits not wanting to miss out on the action iconiq itself coinvests with its clients on the deals they arrangemakan shuns publicity and goes as far as to require clients to sign nondisclosure agreements though iconiq refused comment forbes’ investigation was stitched together from dozens of interviews with those in and around the firm many requested anonymity fearing they would be shut out of makan’s clubthe seeds of iconiq’s controversial family officevc approach were planted in the summer of  with an electrical engineering degree from south africa’s university of natal a management consulting stint at accenture and a wharton mba makan thought he’d make his career in investment banking or private equity but the dotcom crash and recession forced him into a retail sales job in goldman sachs’ san francisco wealth advisory office makan rarely handed out business cards—distancing himself from the vanilla “wealth advisor” label—but he worked hard to ingratiate himself to young moguls finding clients before they became household names sandberg and goldberg joined his roster two years before google’s ipo and he hooked up with zuckerberg and sean parker shortly after facebook moved from a harvard dorm to palo alto makan inspired loyalty by referring clients to each other as much as they referred new ones to him for example he recommended sandberg to facebookin the early days makan would volunteer as a gofer for everything from meeting with estate planning lawyers to buying an engagement ring “divesh will tell clients everything but ‘i’ll pick up your laundry’” says one venture capitalist in an interview in a  issue of families in business magazine makan bragged that he had planned a stag party in las vegas edited business school applications for clients’ kids and even served as a marriage broker money management was but a small part of the job “people care a lot more about us running their life they want us to look after them” he said at the time makan’s fullservice approach clashed with the rigid structure of traditional wall street firms alienating colleagues and compliance officers alike he left goldman in  telling people it was over a workplace disagreement but goldman officially describes the reason for termination as a “loss of trust” either way he landed on his feet with a reported  million signing bonus at morgan stanley thanks to an assist from sandberg who vouched for him goldman coworkers chad boeding and michael anders followed they had more freedom at morgan stanley but still clashed with higherups over the limits to their offthebooks behaviour finally in  with the facebook ipo imminent morgan stanley devised a plan to create an inhouse family office around makan according to former colleagues makan  co walked into a meeting and stated their intent to take the model outside the firm not wanting to anger zuckerberg on the eve of facebook’s ipo morgan stanley quietly let the threeman team strike out on their own these days iconiq reports that it is closed to new clients yet it still actively pitches entrepreneurs developing hot apps the relationship starts with financial advice but often morphs into grabbing a stake in their companies for iconiq and its best clients “divesh is following a timehonoured path” says matt harris managing director at bain capital ventures “goldman has  different businesses and they’re all opaque if a company is raising money they help them raise it they take fees from them and they also take fees from the clients they got to invest”competitors like bruce brugler of  billion presidio group marvel at makan’s success “iconiq is clearly conflicted but that’s their model and it doesn’t seem to slow them down” what could disrupt iconiq’s growth trajectory is a severe downturn in the overheated market for tech stocks and ipos “they’re making a huge bet on the continued bull market the sex appeal of a ‘friends of zuckerberg’ fund and coinvestments that could make them look like heroes” brugler says “but they haven’t been through the down cycle yet”a few clients like zynga’s mark pincus and facebook’s chris hughes have pulled money out of the firm but iconiq continues to reel in new let’smakeadeal clientsthe lure of tech billionaire connections was even dangled in front of forbes iconiq’s spokesman twice offered us “inside scoops” in exchange for dropping our story makan “would be a lot more valuable as an asset you could call all the time” we were told “with his connections divesh could be a great
