statements  atlantica inc notes to unaudited financial statements march   note   basis of presentation this summary of significant accounting policies of atlantica inc the company is presented to assist in understanding the companys financial statements the financial statements and notes are representations of the companys management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements  all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods have been included the accompanying unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring items which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending december   these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   the company has adopted asc topic  development stage companies a organization and business activities the financial statements presented are those of atlantica inc the company was incorporated in the state of utah on march   the company name at that time was red hills mining company on february   the company changed its name to allied oil and minerals company on january   the company changed its name to community equities corporation on march   the company changed its name to atlantica inc we have had no material business operations since march   the companys only activity since that time has consisted of taking actions necessary to restore and preserve its good standing in the state of utah  the company presently has no significant assets  the company intends to continue to seek out the acquisition of assets property or a business that may be beneficial to the company and its stockholders in considering whether to complete any such acquisition the board of directors will make the final determination and the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless required by applicable law the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the company or contract b accounting method the companys financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting the company has elected a december  yearend c estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates d cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents  atlantica inc notes to unaudited financial statements march   note   going concern the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not established revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs the company is seeking to acquire or merge with an existing operating company   the company does not have significant assets nor has it established operations and has accumulated losses since inception these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern it is the intent of the company to seek a merger with an existing wellcapitalized operating company the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty the company is relying on mirabella holdings llc mirabella our majority shareholder to pay all of our operating and other expenses until we can complete a reorganization or merger while mirabella currently pays the companys limited operating and other expenses on the companys behalf mirabella is not obligated to pay any of those expenses and the company can provide no assurance that mirabella will continue to pay any of those expenses in the future  mirabella paid  in expenses for the company during the three months ended march    currently any such loans that may be provided to us from time to time by mirabella are made pursuant to a demand promissory note that has been issued by us to mirabella which loans are unsecured payable on demand and bear interest at a rate of  per annum compounded quarterly  see the description of that demand promissory note contained in part iii item  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and a copy of that note included in part iv item  of that report note   commitments and contingencies contingencies the company has not been active for several years  management believes that there are no unrecorded valid outstanding liabilities from prior operations  if a creditor were to come forward and claim a liability the company has committed to contest the claim to the fullest extent of the law  due to various statutes of limitations and because of the likelihood that such an old liability would not still be valid no amount has been accrued in these financial statements for any such contingencies note   common stock the company did not issue any shares of capital stock during the three month period ended march    atlantica inc notes to unaudited financial statements march   note   loss per share the following data show the amounts used in computing loss per share for the periods presented   for the three months ended march        loss available to common shareholders numerator       weighted average number of common shares           outstanding during the period used in loss per share           denominator         basic loss per share       dilutive loss per share was not presented as the company had no common equivalent shares for all periods presented that would affect the computation of diluted loss per share note   related party transactions mirabella paid expenses of  during the three months ended march   that were recorded as an additional loan from shareholders which loans totaled  at march    the interest expense related to the outstanding loans was  for the three months ended march   and total accrued interest as of march   was   the loans are evidenced by a promissory note are unsecured are due on demand and accrue interest at the rate of  per annum compounded quarterly  no payments of principal or interest were made during the quarter ended march   the note was issued by the company on april   and covers all loans made by mirabella to the company since november   as well as any such loans that may be made by mirabella in the future  a copy of the note was filed as an exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended december   see part iv item  of that report on april   the company entered into a management services agreement the management services agreement with richland gordon  company richland a private investment firm beneficially owned by alan d gordon the companys president and chief executive officer and one of the companys directors  pursuant to the management services agreement richland provides certain financial and management consulting services to the company including among other things advice regarding the companys operations identification of potential businesses for the company to acquire or other suitable business combinations for the company and advice regarding the companys general preparation for its initial acquisition other business combination or financing transaction that may occur in the future  atlantica inc notes to unaudited financial statements march   note   related party transactions continued the management services agreement has a term of ten years and provides for the company to pay to richland an annual management fee equal to the greater of i  or ii  of the companys consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement  the management fee is payable in quarterly installments in arrears on april  july  october  and january  of each year with respect to the immediately preceding calendar quarter equal to the greater of i  or ii  of the companys consolidated ebitda for the immediately preceding calendar quarter with such payments commencing july   and covering services provided by richland during the period from january   prior to the date of the agreement and continuing through the quarter ended march   however the management fees accrue and are not initially payable to richland until the companys completion of its initial acquisition or financing that occurs subsequent to the date of the agreement  accordingly we accrued management fees payable to richland totaling  during the quarter ended march   and  which fees along with any other management fees that may subsequently accrue are due and payable to richland if and when such an acquisition or financing is completed by the company the management services agreement also provides for the company to pay a separate cash transactionbased fee for investment banking services that richland provides in connection with future acquisitions and financing transactions that may be completed by the company  this transactionbased fee equals  of the transaction value of any acquisitions or other business combinations or debt or equity financings completed by the company subsequent to the date of the agreement however the amount of the initial transactionbased fee payable to richland is reduced by the amount of all accrued but unpaid management fees earned by richland under the agreement  to date no transactionbased fee has accrued or is otherwise payable by the company to richland under the management services agreement the company also reimburses richland for all reasonable outofpocket expenses incurred by richland in providing its services to the company and indemnifies richland and its agents and affiliates for any liabilities that they may incur in connection with providing these services  this expense reimbursement is payable on april  july  october  and january  of each year with respect to expenses incurred by richland during the immediately preceding calendar quarter  to date no such expenses have been incurred by richland and accordingly no expenses have been reimbursed by the company to richland and no expense reimbursement obligation has been accrued or is otherwise payable by the company a copy of the management services agreement was filed as an exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended december   see part iv item  of that report note   subsequent events the company has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to asc topic  from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and determined there are no other events to disclose  item    managements discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forwardlooking statements statements made in this quarterly report which are not purely historical are forwardlooking statements with respect to the goals plan objectives intentions expectations financial condition results of operations future performance and our business including without limitation i our ability to raise capital and ii statements preceded by followed by or that include the words may would could should expects projects anticipates believes estimates plans intends targets or similar expressions forwardlooking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements depending upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control  these factors include but are not limited to the following   general economic or industry conditions nationally andor in the communities in which we may conduct business changes in the interest rate environment legislation or regulatory requirements conditions of the securities markets our ability to raise capital changes in accounting principles policies or guidelines financial or political instability acts of war or terrorism and other economic competitive governmental regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters accordingly results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements  forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made  we do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements plan of operation our plan of operation for the next  months is to i consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest ii adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry and iii to commence such operations through funding andor the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected we are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity  in our present form we may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company regardless the commencement of any business opportunity will be preceded by the consideration and adoption of a business plan by our board of directors we do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular business or industry and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or acquisitions reorganizations or mergers may include but will not be limited to the fields of high technology manufacturing natural resources service research and development communications transportation insurance brokerage finance and all medically related fields among others we recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to our company may be extremely limited and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering ipo the most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements legal and accounting costs the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws rules and regulations and federal and state agencies that implement such laws rules and regulations any of these types of transactions regardless of the particular prospect would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as  of our outstanding securities following the completion of any such transaction accordingly investments in any such private enterprise if available would be much more favorable than any investment in our company management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success these may include but will not be limited to as applicable an analysis of the quality of the particular entitys management personnel the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that it may have the merit of its technological changes its present financial condition projected growth potential and available technical financial and managerial resources its working capital history of operations and future prospects the nature of its present and expected competition the quality and experience of its management services and the depth of its management its potential for further research development or exploration risk factors specifically related to its business operations its potential for growth expansion and profit the perceived public recognition or acceptance of its products services trademarks and name identification and numerous other factors which are difficult if not impossible to properly or accurately analyze let alone describe or identify without referring to specific objective criteria  regardless the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future by reason of changing market strategies plant or product expansion changes in product emphasis future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors further in the case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and development mode the risks will be substantial and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business objectives also a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established and with no past track record the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty our management will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded to our company visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of information provided and gathered check references of management and key personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity however due to time constraints of management these activities may be limited we are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor we anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of directors executive officers and principal stockholders professional advisors broker dealers in securities venture capital personnel members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals in certain cases we may agree to pay a finders fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate such persons may include our directors executive officers and beneficial owners our securities or their affiliates in this regard see the description of our management services agreement with richland gordon  company contained in note  to the unaudited financial statements dated march   in part i item   in this event such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and accordingly may present a conflict of interest for such individuals substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions reorganizations or mergers ranging from a small amount to as much as  or more these fees are usually divided among promoters or founders after deduction of legal accounting and other related expenses and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them members of management may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their common stock as a condition to or in connection with a proposed reorganization merger or acquisition it is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buyout transaction in the event that any such fees are paid they may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by our company and accordingly may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals  any of these types of fees that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale limitations embodied in rule  that prohibit among other requirements the public resale of these shares until  months after the filing of the form  information with the sec  we have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities other than pursuant to our management services agreement with richland gordon  company   see the description of our management services agreement with richland contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and a copy of that agreement included in part iv item  of that report with respect to among other things certain cash fees that may be payable by us to richland in connection with future financings and business combinations by us results of operations three months ended march   compared to three months ended march   the company had no operations during the quarterly period ended march   nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing  general and administrative expenses were  for the quarterly period ended march   compared to  for the quarterly period ended march   general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   and  were comprised mainly of accounting management and legal fees  we had a net loss of  for the quarterly period ended march   compared to a net loss of  for the quarterly period ended march    liquidity we have no current cash resources during the next  months our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing in the state of utah and preparing and filing all required reports under the securities laws  we do not have any cash reserves to pay for our administrative expenses for the next  months  in the event that additional funding is required in order to keep us in good standing and current in our reporting obligations we expect to raise such funding through additional loans from our principal shareholder item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not required item   controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q  in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs  the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were subject to the limitations noted above effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules regulations and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure changes in internal control over financial reporting our management with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that
