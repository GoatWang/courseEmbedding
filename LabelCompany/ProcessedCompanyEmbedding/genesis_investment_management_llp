delivered by identifying underpriced companies through independent research and disciplined analysis and using a bottomup investment approach to create a diversified portfolio they believe it is necessary to be patient to achieve these returns and therefore invest with a fiveyear time horizon as investors in emerging market companies the genesis investment team looks to take advantage of structural changes the natural course of economic development creates a dynamic investment environment but one in which the opportunities are unlikely to be captured by those investors focused on the shortterm as changes will unfold over years rather than months change at the corporate level structural changes are unlikely to be universally beneficial to companies but can lead to a more competitive operating environment which challenges management and widens the disparities between individual companies thus providing further opportunities for investors and  stock market
