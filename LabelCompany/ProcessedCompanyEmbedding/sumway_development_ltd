market  implementation  psf  product diversification–  growing sales of a new product in a new market any modification of a current product that serves to expand the potential market implies that the company is following a strategy of product diversification the product diversification strategy is different from product development in that it involves creating a new customer base which by definition expands the market potential of the original product this is almost always done through brand extensions or new brands but in some cases the product modification may create a new market by creating new uses for the product teen people was an example of product diversification since it was a new product that expanded the market potential of the original product people magazine while some teenagers undoubtedly bought people magazine they were not peoples target market eventually however the product and web site were merged into the people brand courtyard by marriott and fairfield inn are other examples of product diversification since before marriott offered those new brands they had little potential to expand sales in the business and budget categories marriott had business and budget guests but they were not specifically targeted so by concentrating on these two markets they were able to add to their market potential it should be apparent why marriott could not expand into such different categories with their original brand name when heinz realized that children play with food and it would be more fun to play with ketchup if it were green or purple rather than red they also were following a product diversification strategy since the market potential for ketchup increased from food to food plus play notice in this case that the brand name was unchanged sometimes product diversification takes the form of a product extension with the same brand name heinzs introduction of black label ketchup heinz tomato ketchup blended with balsamic vinegar targets the upscale buyer who might not consider heinzs regular ketchup thus expanding market potential the dangers of product diversification the main dangers facing a company following a product diversification strategy for a brand are that it could fail to adequately understand the new customer base and that any new brand name may result in loss of meaning for the original brand andor cannibalization of the original brand particularly if it is a brand extension the risk of not understanding the new customer base is present as it is with market development and the risks of loss of meaning andor cannibalization are just as significant as with product development for while teen people had limited success all of the womens sports magazines failed the new market women was not interested in the new product new magazines with various titles since—unlike men—women did not want to read a magazine about sports without some link to fitness and the few who did buy the new magazines simply switched from the mens versions the special case of retailers just as with product development retailers present a special case thus subways conversion from a ordinary sub shop to a healthy food outlet not only changed the brands positioning substantially but also added new potential customers since before the change many of them would have never considered a subway back to productmarket growth matrix

affairs posted on august  august   by editorial staff the sun may rise the sun may set but the sun will set on a subway logo there is no doubt that subway is the world’s largest fast food chain with more  stores that are serving healthy subs in  countries and do you know what subway has been busy with making their subs even healthier and still trying to cover more earth spacemore subway stores for subway is set to hitting its target of  additional stores for  news from the milford headquarters is that the company likes to take advantage of their versatility in space requirements to seek potential sites that can house a subway store regardless of size and layoutaccording to john devine director of subway real estate large spaces are always ideal especially the ones that accommodate a drivethru but they are always considering the small store concept which represents  of their stores which are conveniently located in cstores universities hospitals and sports arenas chris kan training and business promotion specialist for subway real estate says that the main advantage of subway over their competitors is that the subway concept is so flexible that it allows stores to come in various shapes and sizes and that accounts for the massive  million square feet of subway property that is scattered in more than  countries in the worldthis massive expansion campaign includes all territories and one of the most promising growth areas is china there’s more to china now than just dumplings and noodles in fact if you happen to visit the great wall in beijing the biggest restaurant at the tourists’ entrance where the cable cars are located is a subway store which is only one of the  stores that they are planning to put up by the end of with so many subway stores located in major cities of the world it is high time subway tries to explore new markets while the company concerns itself with selling more subs it also focus in making the subway business venture profitable subway can’t have too many stores operating too close to one another because they will eat up each other’s market with more than  locations the free capitalist world is getting smaller and smaller for the fast food giant this is why subway is focusing on china and they should also include middle east as another possible growth areahealthier subway subsand along with their expansion plans subway is focused in making their food healthier subway has joined the band wagon in the fast food companies’ movement towards eliminating artificial flavors in their list of ingredients however according to elizabeth stewart director of corporate social responsibility for subway this move will be a little harder for subway because of their size and scope at the moment subway research and development is working overtime to figure out which ingredients can go immediately and which ones would require more time a realistic target for total removal of all artificial flavors and preservatives for subway’s north american stores is  a lot may be asking why should it take that longit is very important for subway to be very cautious and gradual about the changes they are going to make because being the healthier alternative among the fast food chains they have to make sure that their food will still be good enough to eat the main objecting is to make the healthy changes without sacrificing taste so that people will still prefer to eat the subway subs what’s the point of making a healthier sub when nobody is eating them anymorewhat subway can do at the moment is start introducing new products that will already follow the zeroartificial flavor and zeropreservative conditions to start this off subway will be introducing a new roast beef recipe that will not contain any artificial flavors or preservatives then by august subway will introduce a new ham that will also be free of artificial flavor and preservatives these two new products will be available in  us restaurants soonsubway singapore special saf offeringon a lighter note subway singapore has something special for the men and women of the singapore armed forces saf as singapore celebrates national saf day on july  subway would like to take the opportunity to express their gratitude and deep appreciation for the men and women of the saf by giving free regular meal upgrades for all saf personnel
