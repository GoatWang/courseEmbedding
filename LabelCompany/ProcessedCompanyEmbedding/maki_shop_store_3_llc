recommend this store if you are looking for quality products from ecuador if you cant find them keep looking i initially gave this store a poor review because i thought they were out of business it was not at the location listed and the tourist info office across the street had never heard of them but a couple of days later i unexpectedly found the store in a new location they told me that they had been closed because of the recent move i am so glad i found them because their merchandise is top notch and i feel good that the money is going to support the artisans themselves since that time i see that they have updated their address online visited july  helpful thank ann m report ask ann m about maki fairtrade this review is the subjective opinion of a tripadvisor member and not of

best shops for handmade products in the city we were delighted by the actual work done behind scenes they work with local producers on a fair trade basis but more interestingly they are linked to a
