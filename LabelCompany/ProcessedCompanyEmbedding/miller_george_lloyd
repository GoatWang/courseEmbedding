application   letter no  duncan arizona february   belva a lockwood washington d c dear madam enclosed herewith please find a copy of the �special master�s report   of judge springer�s court which was appealed from the commission of the five civilized tribes� the contention of the appellee that we failed to show that our ancestors through whom we claim were ever recognized as citizens of the cherokee nation since it�s removal west will say in reply none of those ancestors susan lloyd nee parsons samuel parsons and water hunter never moved west but lived and died in the old cherokee nation but peter parsons who makes one of the affidavits mentions herein is a nephew of said samuel parsons and he and his family and mother were all recognized as citizens of the cherokee nation and were on the roll and drew money at tahlequah my father george a lloyd and family moved from georgia in spring of  and in the fall of the same year he put in his application before the council at tahlequah all of which goes to show it was not neglect or any fault of his that we were not recognized as citizens of the cherokee nation most of the claimants of the citizenship association claim that the commission were bought by the appellee and that they did not have a fair and impartial trial that their evidence was treated with contempt all the council required the claimants to prove was that they were cherokees by blood and we did that it is true our property was appraised and its value tendered but we rejected it on the grounds that we still had a right to keep our homes i have not received and compensation for the same up to the present time w j watts was our local attorney when the case was before the council and filed with them all of our affidavits and evidence i think they have the name of water hunter spelled �walter� which is a mistake would be glad to give you any information i possibly can and to hear from you any time as to the progress you are making very truly your

the year  and put his claim in before the council but they put him off from time to time and he continued to gather his proof from year to year and to go before the council up to the time he died in the year  after his death my mother sister and brothers continued to press the claim and appear before the council until  when the dawes commission was appointed to final settlement between the indians and the claimants our proofs were gotten up in due form and sent in to the dawes commission but it being prejudice against the claimants they did not as much as open the envelope containing the proofs not only of our claim but the did hundreds of others in the same way in other words they had the case decided before the proof was ever put in we took an appeal from the dawes commission through our attorney jeff watts in the fall or spring of  or � to judge springer�s court at muskogee i t who examined our proof and decided that my father was a cherokee by blood but said he did not have the jurisdiction to say that we should be enrolled as citizens we have the master and chancery report of his court but it is with some of my brothers or sisters and i am endeavouring to find out which one has it and as soon as i locate it i will send it to you mother says father often told her he remembered when he was a boy of about eight or nine years old going with his mother susan lloyd

show to the court that under the general order herein i have examined the proof and pleading in this case which are herewith made a part of this report and that i find as follows st that this case was instituted on september th  before the commission to the five civilized tribes and the application denied on november th  and on december th  the parties appealed from said decision to this court that the application was made by john g lloyd william w lloyd minnie t lloyd edith a brady and josephine barthell the children of dr george w lloyd deceased and by mary a lloyd the wife of said dr george w lloyd that the parties reside at mcfall indian territory where they have lived for nineteen years that they file in support of their application the affidavits of mary a lloyd j n wimpee joseph m morris peter parson elizabeth morris martha mullenax john ross thomas j gattis nathan w wanslee gideon f morris green b kite and thomas lumpkin and a certificate from w j watts showing a copy of the family record of george w lloyd deceased nd that the testimony in this case consists principally of copies of affidavits presented to the cherokee commission on citizenship known as the chambers court in the year  at which time dr g w lloyd made application for himself and family to said commission which application was rejected that these claimants are the children of g w lloyd deceased who was the son of susan lloyd who was the daughter of samuel parsons who was the son of water hunter who is said to be a cherokee indian by blood rd the defendant files the proceedings of the said citizenship court in the year  including the testimony filed and the decision of the commission rejecting dr lloyd and his family th the claimants contend that under the showing that they are descended from samuel parsons and walter hunter who were known to be cherokee indians by blood they are entitled to admission to citizenship of the cherokee nation as citizens by blood while the appellee contends that by reasons of the claimants failing to show that the ancestors through whom they claim have ever been recognized as citizens of the cherokee nation since its removal west and furtherly by reason of the fact that the claimants have heretofore made application to the cherokee commission on citizenship for admission to the cherokee nation and have been rejected and that by act of congress of march the rd  they have been declared �intruders� and their property appraised and its value tendered them these claimants are barred from being admitted to citizenship in the cherokee nation the premises considered i find that the claimants are the descendants of samuel parsons and water hunter that they are cherokee indians by blood and reside in the cherokee nation that they have heretofore applied to the regularly constituted commission of the cherokee nation for admission to the cherokee nation as citizens by blood and have been rejected by said commission that they have been declared intruders and the value of their improvements tendered them by the proper authorities and that they do not show that the ancestors through whom they claim were ever enrolled as
