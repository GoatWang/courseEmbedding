the us include fullspectrum lending and leasing offered through gmfranchised dealers under the gm financial brand we also offer a subprime lending product through nongmfranchised and select independent dealers under the americredit brand our subprime lending program is designed to serve customers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions we therefore generally charge higher rates than those charged by banks and credit unions and expect to sustain a higher level of credit losses than on prime lending we finance new gm vehicles moderatelypriced new vehicles from other manufacturers and latermodel low mileage used vehicles our international retail lending and leasing programs focus on financing new gm vehicles and select used vehicles we also offer finance andor carrelated insurance products through third parties such as payment protection gap extended warranty and motor insurance we have expanded our leasing and prime lending programs through gmfranchised dealerships in the us therefore leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of our originations and retail portfolio balance we have been the exclusive subvented

number of operating leases returned divided by the number of operating leases terminated table of contents general motors financial company inc operating leases terminated and operating lease vehicles returned increased due to the growth and maturity of the lease portfolio due to the current age and size of our lease portfolio the current return rate is lower than we expect it to be in future

consolidated financial statements for more information related to the assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations of our european operations our principal focus is on expanding our business in the us to reach full captive penetration levels therefore we do not expect that the sale of our european operations will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition liquidity or financing strategies including the mix of secured and unsecured debt issuances we also do not expect that the sale of our european operations will result in a material increase in our ratio of total debt to total equity or our earning assets leverage ratio as calculated under our support agreement with gm due to the size of the prime retail loan portfolio held by our european operations we expect that for a period of time following the sale retail operating leases will make up a greater percentage of our earning assets than they have historically as our us operations increase purchases of prime retail loans we expect that our earning asset mix will return to more recent historical levels we may make a special dividend to gm following the
