httpwwwemccom ■ joseph m tucci became president of emc corporation in january  and a year later was also named chief executive officer emc was a leading provider of products services and solutions for information storage and management most importantly including raid redundant array of independent disks storage systems as well as a comprehensive number of nas network attached storage file servers and a full line of software designed to manage share and protect data emc sold its products both directly and through distributors and manufacturers such as its largest partner the personalcomputer company dell which sold cobranded emc systems when tucci joined emc after a decade of strong financial gains the company was no longer the uncontested market leader in information storage three factors—the economic downturn that began in  the tragic terrorist attacks of september   and increased competition from ibm hitachi data systems and others—proceeded to reverse the onceprosperous direction of emc fortunately tucci was experienced at turning companies hit by financial hardships around during his period of leadership at emc he proved that he could indeed weather any economic storm joseph m tucci apwide world photos  beginning his career tucci earned a bachelors degree in marketing from manhattan college of riverdale new york in  and a masters in business administration from columbia university in  tucci began his professional career in  as a systems programmer at rca corporation later tucci became president of us information systems at unisys corporation after the company was formed by a merger between burroughs and sperry in  turning wang around in  tucci joined wang global an informationtechnology services company as an executive vice president of operations in charge of all marketing sales service and support he became chairman of the board and chief executive officer in december  and remained at those positions until june  tucci directed the operational and financial reorganization of wang global over the sixyear period beginning in  during which the company went through chapter  bankruptcy tucci called wang a business execution failure as the company had entered too many segments of the office computer market and failed to notice the industry shift from mainframe computers to local area networks connecting arrays of personal computers tucci began wangs turnaround by identifying the companys past strengths a large and loyal customer base a global identity a comprehensive range of services superior service delivery strategic alliances with industry leaders and retention of key technical employees he guided wang through a costly but successful emergence from bankruptcy protection and eventually transformed the company from a manufacturer of midrange computers into a service provider of network and desktoptechnology services and solutions between  and  tucci spearheaded acquisitions of  companies in order to complement wangs existing serviceprovider capabilities moves that increased the number of wang employees to  and raised its annual revenues from under  billion in  to  billion in  at the end of this period tucci arranged a  billion acquisition of wang by the netherlandsbased informationtechnology services company getronics where tucci served as deputy ceo from june to december  tucci gained valuable leadership and management experience while directing the reorganization of wang the lessons he learned there proved useful when he was faced with similar problems at emc new arrival in january  at emc the then ceo mike ruettgers hired tucci as his ceointraining in the newly created position of president and coo after a fourmonth recruitment effort saying tucci was the only person he considered qualified for the job when tucci assumed the leadership role a year later he was handed a company with a terrific financial record ruettgers had successfully spurred the companys growth for a decade at an average annual revenue increase of  percent between  and  the datastorage powerhouse doubled its revenues to  billion by  emc was the clear market leader in information storage when ruettgers stepped down in january  the bull stock market that had helped support the companys  years worth of fabulous returns disappeared however tucci was not disheartened when emc failed to meet its firstquarter earnings projections in april —for the first time in five years—due to the collapse of the technology industry he wisely adhered to the same formula he had successfully employed at wang strenuously slashing expenses and comprehensively renovating the existing business model challenges confronted faced with a different economic world one of tuccis biggest challenges would be to change the companys culture of isolation to one of effective cooperation with both customers and rivals prior to tuccis joining the company employees at emc had developed an exaggerated superior attitude with respect to the companys products complete with a take it or leave it approach with regards to product sales tucci ushered in a more customerfriendly attitude when he relinquished the companys exclusive use of direct competitive sales in order to adopt the additional strategy of selling products indirectly through partners which lowered expenses tucci also initiated sales of storage software to customers who used rival hardware rather than only to its own hardware customers extending products and services another of tuccis rescue tactics was to forcibly drive the company to extend its market and technology leadership beyond highend informationstorage systems and software and into comprehensive informationmanagement solutions tucci also directed the company to reduce staff refocus business units tighten expenses and reduce inventories in order to ensure its future profitability keeping in mind a longterm commitment to cutting expenses while continuing to invest in new technology tucci instituted the most enterprising schedule of newproduct introductions in emcs history remodeling the companys existing product line in the process successful innovations included the clariion cx series which positioned emc as the price and performance leader in midlevel storage the visionary highend storage architecture of the symmetrix direct matrix the centera content addressed storage which established a new category of storage for the fixedcontent market and the expansion of the celerra series of networkattached storage tucci also ushered emc into the field of openstorage management software overseeing the introduction of an expanded line of multiplatform software that was eventually recognized by analysts as as being the best in the industry in  tucci led emcs acquisition of three leading independent software providers documentum specializing in enterprise content management legato systems specializing in backup recovery and other storage and vmware specializing in server virtualization end results in the latter part of  tucci was able to begin lowering emcs cost structure increasing cash and investments and strengthening management through the hiring of executives from other major technology companies tucci expanded emcs global alliances and professional services programs and acquired six additional software companies he committed about threefourths of emcs  research and development budget to strengthening the companys informationstorage software and focused the company on delivering informationstorage solutions which reduced the total expense of operations and created additional value for emcs stockholders after the two terrible years of  and  had resulted in more than  million in total losses thousands of employee layoffs marketshare reductions and a lessening of pricing power emc regained its footing in  tucci spent more than  billion to strengthen its product line acquire five software companies and further shift its revenue ratio toward highermargin software rather than hardware lisa dicarlo of forbescom reported that the merrill lynch analyst steven milunovich stated in a research report ems appears well positioned in that storage remains a high spending priority and execution has been excellent january   in an article by sean kelly for communication news tucci was quoted in reflecting on the troubling times at wang and emc as saying leading through those times can be extra challenging but also extra rewarding if you have strong leadership people look up january  as of  thanks to tuccis leadership emc continued to be the world leader in information storage retrieval and management helping organizations such as retailers banks internet service providers manufacturers and government agencies incur low costs and receive premium value from emcs comprehensive spectrum of information services revenues from  totaled  billion type a aggressive tucci described himself as type a aggressive and was significantly more outspoken than his predecessor at emc while in training for the ceo position he told analysts that emc would be the leader in the networkattached storage market by the end of  it was ranked second at the time the news media widely reported the bold attentiongrabbing prediction in recalling that incident tucci gave credit to his employees for believing in his goal and making it become a reality by the end of the first quarter of  emc had posted revenues of  million which was tops in the networkattached storage market the former leader had dropped to second

tucci agreed to stay as emc chairman and chief executive until the transaction was completed according to a statement on monday after that when he leaves he will be owed  million by emc according to

share price declined about  percent over the last three years before the deal was announced for mr tucci however elliott’s idea of spinning off vmware the virtualization software specialist in which emc owns an  percent stake was not the ideal option he looked at the large structure of emc “almost as one of his kids” said daniel ives of fbr capital markets video michael dell on  billion deal for

year as well dell’s founder michael dell said on cnbc on monday elliott ultimately said it supported the acquisition in which dell agreed to pay  per emc share including cash and tracking stock linked to emc’s stake in vmware“i don’t think he wanted to go out in a bad way by being forced into a breakup” mr ives said of mr tucci “this way he’s able to put a bow around his career and it’s a good way

fbr capital markets“in terms of legacy it’s really going to depend on how longerterm this deal ends up” he said “if we look out two or three years from now and dell was really able to pull this off

standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
