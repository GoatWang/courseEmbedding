target company the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of  basis of presentation the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the companys unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the period from april   inception to september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of september   concentration of risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september        opal island acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments recent accounting pronouncements on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the

companies cannot directly apply to be quoted on the otc bulletin board only market makers can initiate quotes and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative financial requirements any

the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived benefits of a reporting corporation such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees increasing the opportunity to use securities for acquisitions providing liquidity for shareholders and other factors business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex the search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific kind of business entities but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its business life it is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which the company may become engaged whether such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture licensing

management understanding business plans assisting in capital raising and determining corporate structure and objectives james mckillop serves as a director and vice president of the company mr mckillop began his career at merrill lynch mr mckillop has also been involved in financial reporting and did a daily stock market update for kpcc radio in pasadena california mr mckillop is the founder of mb americus llc which specializes in consulting and public relations mr mckillop has provided consulting services to tiber creek corporation for more than five years mr mckillop has written articles for various publications on financial matters he has been a past member of the world affairs council mr mckillop received his bachelor of arts in economics in  from the university of california at los angeles with his background in financial and securities matters the company believes mr mckillop to have experience and knowledge that will serve the company in seeking evaluating and determining a suitable target company there are no agreements or understandings for the abovenamed officers or directors to resign at the request of another person and the abovenamed officers and directors are not acting on behalf of nor will act at the direction of any other person recent blank check companies james cassidy the president and a director of the company and james mckillop vice president and a director of the company are involved with other existing blank check companies and in creating additional similar companies the initial business purpose of each of these companies was or is to engage in a business combination with an unidentified company or companies and each were or will be classified as a blank check company until completion of a business combination conflicts of interest the officers and directors of the company have organized and expect to organize other companies with an identicial structure purpose officers directors and shareholders as such management believes there is no conflict of interest in these companies the blank check companies with which management including the directors is involved are identical except for the name as and when created no one blank check company offers management any more favorable terms than the others thus no conflict of interest arises for management between any of the blank check companies mr cassidy andor mr mckillop may become associated with additional blank check companies prior to the time that the company has effected a business combination mr cassidy is the principal of cassidy  associates a securities law firm as such demands may be placed on the time of mr cassidy which will detract from the amount of time he is able to devote to the company mr cassidy intends to devote as much time to the activities of the company as required however should such a conflict arise there is no assurance that mr cassidy would not attend to other matters prior to those of the company there are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest failure by management to resolve conflicts of interest in favor of the company could result in liability of management to the company however any attempt by shareholders to enforce a liability of management to the company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming code of ethics the company has not at this time adopted a code of ethics pursuant to rules described in regulation sk the company has two persons who are the only shareholders and who serve as the directors and officers the company has no operations or business and does not receive any revenues or investment capital the adoption of an ethical code at this time would not serve the primary purpose of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as the development execution and enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons and only persons to whom such code applied furthermore because the company does not have any activities there are activities or transactions which would be subject to this code at the time the company enters into a business combination or other corporate transaction the current officers and directors will recommend to any new management that such a code be adopted the company does not maintain an internet website on which to post a code of ethics corporate governance for reasons similar to those described above the company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the board of directors at this time the company consists of two shareholders who serve as the corporate directors and officers the company has no activities and receives no revenues at such time that the company enters into a business combination andor has additional shareholders and a larger board of directors and commences activities the company will propose creating committees of its board of directors including both a nominating and an audit committee because there are only two shareholders of the company there is no established process by which shareholders to the company can nominate members to the companys board of directors similarly however at such time as the company has more shareholders and an expanded board of directors the new management of the company may review and implement as necessary procedures for shareholder nomination of members to the companys board of directors item  executive compensation the companys officers and directors do not receive any compensation for services rendered to the company nor have they received such compensation in the past the officers and directors are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the company no retirement pension profit sharing stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the company for the benefit of its employees the company does not have a compensation committee for the same reasons as described above item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters the following table sets forth as of december   each person known by the company to be the beneficial owner of five percent or more of the companys common stock and the director and officer of the company the company does not have any compensation plans and has not authorized any securities for future issuance except as noted the holder thereof has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown name and address amount of beneficial percent of of beneficial owner ownership outstanding stock james m cassidy    apolena avenue newport beach ca

independence the company has issued a total of  shares of common stock pursuant to section  of the securities act for services performed for the company with a valuation of an aggregate of  as the organizers and developers of the company james m cassidy and james mckillop may be considered promoters mr cassidy has provided services to the company without charge consisting of preparing and filing the charter corporate documents and preparing this registration statement the company is not currently required to maintain an independent director as defined by rule  of the nasdaq capital market nor does it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its securities on an exchange in which an independent directorship is required it is likely that neither mr cassidy nor mr mckillop would not be considered independent directors if it were to do so item  principal accounting fees and services the company has no activities no income and no expenses except for independent audit and delaware state fees the companys president has donated his time in preparation and filing of all state and federal required taxes and reports audit fees the aggregate fees incurred for each of the last two years for professional services rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm for the audits of the companys annual financial statements and review of financial

entity for the combination of that target company with opal island the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the

assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of  basis of presentation the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the companys financial statements such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements the company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception accordingly the companys activities have been accounted for as those of a development stage enterprise as set forth in asc  development stage entities among the disclosures required by asc  are that the companys financial statements be identified as those of a development stage company and that the statements of operations stockholders equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the companys inception the company chose december  as its fiscal year end use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of december   concentration of risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of december    pkth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  opal island acquisition corporation notes to financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of december   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments note   going concern the company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating losses of  during the period ended december   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of december   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources as may be required  pklast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  opal island acquisition corporation notes to financial statements the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity if the company is unable to acquire additional working capital it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations note   recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  statement of cash flows topic  restricted cash asu  the new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu  which will only impact the company if it has restricted cash in the future in august  the fasb issued asu  statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments asu   asu  will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on its condensed financial statements in august  the fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern this standard is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures under us gaap financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern except in limited circumstances financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting the going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities currently us gaap lacks guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organizations ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures this asu provides guidance to an organizations management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes the amendments are effective for annual periods ending after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force and the united states
