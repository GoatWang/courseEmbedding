regulate the dosage and timing of bioactive blue light to increase human health and productivity throughout the  daynight cycle the initial circadian® light products are fully autonomous light fixtures that can be installed by any qualified electrician and regulate the timing of the bioactive blue light by time of day season of the year and zip code ie latitude and longitude for up to  years without requiring any changes or additional input they are specifically designed to boost productivity and decrease absenteeism turnover errors and accidents in workplaces that operate around the clock by controlling the bioactive blue dosage the proprietary circadian® leds reduce the harmful spectral wavelengths that have been associated with an increase of  in obesity diabetes heart disease sleep disorders depression reproductive disorders and multiple cancers including breast cancer and prostate cancer circadian® lights solve the night lighting problem by providing high quality white light  and avoid the dimming and low color temperature approaches used by other socalled “circadian” lighting products which do not sufficiently reduce the bioactive blue dosage when the dark side of energy efficient light was recognized by the world health organization american medical association and national institutes of health among others circadian was among the first to recognize the implications for the  employers and workforce and to start finding the solutions our discoveries have enabled a practical solution to the led lighting problem and resulted in an extensive ip portfolio circadian light products incorporate insights generated by over a decade of breakthrough biomedical research conducted at leading universities including university of toronto  circadian is unique in the lighting industry in having an inhouse  workplace simulation within a medical research center in the circadian light center people live and work and sleep under spectrallyspecific lighting to enable the development of optimal lighting products we measure the impact of the light spectrum on blood urine and saliva hormones disease markers blood pressure and sleep to define the optimal scheduling of bioactive light dosage this worldclass facility has been critical in optimizing the light spectra to improve performance decrease errors and reduce the probability of fatigue
