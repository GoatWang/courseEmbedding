ikeacste’s market analysis is illogical and over represent its poor market impact the significance of growing competition in the usa is not acknowledged by cstecste has consistently missed guidance a theme we believe is unlikely to change summary short thesis as a prelude to our piece ben axler of spruce point capital has written two good short reports on caesarstone nasdaqcste we will not be doubling down on much of bens data which remains relevant and should be considered concurrently our report can also be found on the viceroy blog poor management guidance flying under the radar management has a history of producing inconsistent information numerous revisions and profit downgrades management announced negative  yoy earnings growth guidance in february despite this the stock is up figure    earnings results   feb  figure   earnings guidance   feb  negative yoy earnings growth guidance appears to have no effect on sellside analysis despite guidance showing reduced yoy earnings chardan analysts claim that the business now represents less risk and therefore derive an increased valuation based on a reduced wacc figure   chardan cste note   may  the chardan valuation is based on a similar hollywood justification as other sellside analysts including stifel figure  stifel  cste note   march  earnings misses and downgrades impromptu management changes auditor concerns quality concerns increasingly competitive markets and kibbutz board activism are apparently obscure concepts to stifel which simply provides a hindsight note after a major share price fall then upgrade a few weeks later all on the back of an obscure evebitda multiple on top of this management embarrassingly had to revise its earnings downwards on the back of accounting misstatements an issue perhaps foreshadowed in spruce point pieces lowes cstes f states that the company commenced offering our products and related services in several lowes stores in the united states in the first quarter of  management commented further on this development in the companys q earnings call we are already in around  stores in few of the states that lowes selected it appears that the company failed to inform lowes nyselow of this latest development or cste lack the foresight to communicate with its endcustomers effectively to any material sales our channel checks with lowes customer service confirm the transform™ product is not available at lowes stores as of the date of this report nor is any other cste product physical channel checks into lowes stores and a review of its online catalogue confirm that no cste product is available for purchase at any lowes store as of the date of this report meanwhile lowes is stocking what appears to be an increasing catalogue of products from cste competitor silestone there are further concerns over the transform™ product if it ever enters the market on a large scale basis an experienced industry contractor has advised he would be hesitant to fit the product as the thin quartz layer is likely susceptible to wear and tear and cracking and overlaid on top of old fittings which are susceptible to rot and pungent stale water causes smells near sinks the transform product is not a permanent solution sec the sec issued a request for further information to clarify a number of ambiguous statements in cstes  f specifically in regards to revenue movements including fx and average selling prices and aggregated operating segments management attributes increased yoy revenue to increased average selling prices and increased volumes this does not reflect ground level pricing which we have found to be decreasing and excessive volume increases do not correspond to the consensus of the cste reseller agents we contacted ikea cstes statements about average selling prices are contradicted by its customers advertised selling prices between  and  cstes ikea catalogue prices decreased by between  and  excluding enticements and free installation the reality is ikea is suffering as a result of greater competition in the market place silicosis  the cost of doing business silicosis is an emerging risk in workers who process quartz and other silicon dust producing materials this is an unknown variable for cste although provisions have been made for those claims filed its noteworthy that there is a significant class action that could have a material impact on the companys balance sheet of approximately m there has been no provision for this m class action competition quartz countertops are undoubtedly a market where competition is growing significantly price reductions are being seen in the range of  in ikea alone ikea prices its stock at an  discount to identical cste reseller retail prices with so many companies intending to compete within the marketplace it is of additional concern that cste usas former ceo arik tendler has entered the market with a product whose marketing appears to address many of cstes negative online reviews related highlighting quality concerns comp analysis caesarstones marketing expenses are remarkably low considering it alleges to have over x distributors in the usa vs silestone caesarstones maintenance capex spending is substantially lower than silestone despite cstes higher revenues and cogs silestones margins as a premium product are  higher suggesting less volume sold per unit of revenue and therefore lower wear  tear machinery expenses all quartz machinery incl frequent wear  tear replacement parts is bought from niche group of suppliers with limited price variances a comparative financial analysis against competitor silestone reinforces our belief that caesarstones financial statements are misrepresented specifically we believe that cste is either not properly maintaining its assets or its production utilization is much lower than reported  the disappearing bull case  have cste investors forgotten what was previously on the counter the bull case is highly predicated on growth and taking more market share despite lower profitability analysts suggest the possibility of a takeouts or ma the reality is nothing has ever been concluded including the ceo jumping ship with significant exit payment of usm the bull case reality steady top line growth slow top line growth more than offset by increased cost margins dividends discontinued despite reported m cash balance stock buyback programme discontinued despite reported m cash balance increased target price on lessrisky wacc earnings guidance is down yoy and there is a m unrecorded class action pending how does this pose less risk  nothing on the counter at lowes caesarstones market expansion strategy took on another direction in its most recent filings announcing a collaboration with lowes™ marketing a new overlay product called transform™ cstes f states that the company commenced offering our products and related services in several lowes stores in the united states in the first quarter of  it appears that either the company failed to inform lowes of this latest development or the time expectations of commercializing this agreement are entirely flawed the product is not available at lowes stores via customer service for purchase preorder or samples as of the date of this report in fact lowes customer service has never heard of this product lowes instore channel checks analysts and investors should check lowes sales channels before suggesting its significance as a growth driver we spoke with lowes on multiple occasions from the time of cstes first collaboration announcement  february  to the date of this report making extensive inquiries not one of lowes customer service representatives we spoke to was able to locate caesarstones transform™ product or any cste product two customer service agents suggested we try ikea™ or purchasing another product silestone it is worthwhile noting that while lowes stocks no caesarstone of any kind it has an extensive range of silestone and a few other brands including its own brand not one of lowes customer service representatives we spoke to were able to locate caesarstones transform™ product or any caesarstone product whatsoever the sellside is expecting a material upside in the lowes collaboration and a reputed revenue growth driver based on this data its likely investors are going to be left materially disappointed figure   stifel earnings analysis   feb  online channel check we conducted an online search on lowes website searching by brand search term quartz countertops accessed june   figure   lowes website results  search term quartz countertops other failed search terms included transform worktop caesarstone and overlay worktop a caesarstone product search on lowes website returned no results and instead offered a healthy range of competitors products key takeaways despite extensive searches both instore via customer services and lowes website there was no evidence of a transform rollout programme there was no product sample availability no staff awareness of the product and lowes customer service advised there was no preorder availability for any transform™ or caesarstone product investors in cste would be wise to consider lowes spring sales are a key period for the company as with most homecenter retailers despite stating sales were expected to start in  q caesarstone has clearly missed this window of opportunity that the building products sector has traditionally been reliant on additionally if the transform™ product becomes available at lowes at some stage in the future investors would be wise to consider lowes is a massmarket retailer with no premium status similar to ikea and such an agreement will further destroy whatever remaining premiumbrand recognition cste has left cste will have to play a lowesmargin game offering a cheaper substitute product through lowes would further deteriorate earnings through cannibalization as cste would essentially be undercutting itself  sales channels  increased competition fabricated product offerings  phantom agents we conducted substantial channel checks into agents listed on cstes website and into product lines over the last three months our main findings were that the transform™ product is so far unavailable for purchase at lowes cstes supply chain is filled with phantom agents who no longer sell and in many instances have never sold caesarstone products with apparent lack of supply chain management we doubt that cste is attempting to recover any stock it has loaned or extended on credit terms to its reseller agents a decline in prices over the past year and cstes market being more competitive it raises the question as to the real value of its inventory and finished goods it is our view that cste must revalue its inhouse finished goods inventory and inventory held by resellers represented within cstes accounts receivable cste usas former ceo arik tendler appears to have entered the usa market with a superior product under the brand vadara quartz vadaras marketing appears to address quality issues that plague caesarstone online reviews crackingchipping staining and using chemicals our channel checks suggest cste is meeting its demand straight from the production line and reseller built up inventory appears to be unpopular stock which is difficult to sell poor sales channel management industry professionals indicate that the market place is significantly more competitive raising the question as to whether cste can afford to be failing so miserably in managing its customer referral points omnichannel marketing  suggests cste is ignoring all the basic rules in the usa uk and australian markets there is an apparent failure to maintain basic uptodate reseller agent information there was basic referral information missing such as email website andor telephone details an industry professional questioned whether there is any management of caesarstones sales channels at all as a comparison silestones us agent and supplier list appears well maintained with basic rules of online sales and referrals being followed what is the real number of reseller agents in caesarstones network cste has more than tenfold the number of alleged registered reseller agents compared to the likes of silestone cstes agent count is circa  whereas silestones is a mere  fig  silestone lists outlets such as home depot nysehd and lowes figure   caesarstone agents downloaded as of  march  figure   silestone registered agents as of april   our channel checks demonstrated that a good percentage of these agents do not sell or in some instances have never sold caesarstone which raises the question why they were ever recorded as reseller agents in the first place of those alleged registered agentssuppliers contacted there was a theme a significant number of contractors would entice and promote other products including granite on the merits of quality price point andor not being a caesarstone agent cstes raw ingredient costs were previously exposed by spruce point as being materially higher than what was disclosed this is compounded by increased competition in top line sales and a decreasing average selling price reinforced by new and existing competitors expanding andor entering the north american market its likely that cstes biggest customer after ikea is its own marketing department if cstes reseller database is accurate it would require a significant volume of samples given the spread of its reseller network its no wonder that cstes forecasted revenues in ikea the largest customer to date is a finger in the wind exercise and subject to sec enquiries with a lack of supplier management we pose the question what is the cost of display items and stock on loan to resellers who are no longer selling caesarstone products should agent inventory be reflected on cstes accounts or on a returns basis if it is not sold to an end user it is our view that cste will have to impair its finished goods inventory held by such agents ie receivables impairment australia it is difficult to assess cstes commercial relationship footprint in australia its second largest market there appears to be a significant lack of reselling agents only one display room is listed in sydney a cste branded showroom and only two in melbourne despite these being high population areas with competition increasing cste appears to be falling behind its competitors on a real targeted footprint basis uk it appears that cste has purchased or collated a defunct database of kitchen fitters worktop fabricators and suppliers and transformed this into a reseller catalogue there is a similar theme to the usa where agents are either no longer operating no longer sell caesarstone are exclusive to competitors or have never sold cste products  the transform issue much hype has surrounded cstes new line at lowes expected to have commenced sales q  the mm quartz overlay branded as the transform range the range is being marketed as a new alternative to traditional benchtops by fitting a mm overlay onto an existing worktop note that prior to this announcement caesarstone has never sold mm thickness quartz as a countertop option in the north americas on face value investors would be excited about a new product reaching an asyet untapped market however caesarstones international sales websites tell a different story our channel checks suggest transform is a repackaged preexisting product that has been available for sale in overseas market as far back as march  pure white mm thickness on australian website dated  frosty carrina mm thickness on australian website dated  mm product options are listed on many of cstes international websites including but not limited to brazil australia the uk and israel caesarstone has also sold the mm quartz in north america before in some of the same color ranges as the transform product but as bathroom splashbacks not countertops the reality of the situation is that caesarstones transform is likely a mishmash of mm products that were unsellable overseas and are now being repackaged as a lowmargin solution through lowes in the hope of avoiding substantial inventory impairments is lowes transform old stock that cste were unable to sell and is now being repackaged in the hope of avoiding inventory writedowns mm products were sold as splashbacks what are the cracking and heat fracture risks  increasing competition cstes understatement of the year we have also experienced instances of our competitors marketing products with similar appearances and similar model names to some of our products competition of this nature may increase in the markets in which we operate and may develop in new markets increased competition the market is becoming significantly more competitive with the following brands recently entering into competing with cste in the north americas arenastone cimstone diresco hanstone okite quarella quartz compac quantra pokarna quartz stone italiana radianz by samsung technistone trafficstone unistone vadara quartz vicostone zodiaq by dupont in addition established players such as pokarna quartz have aspirations to expand their us footprint these competitors have advantages over cste be they input costs cost of labour fx benefits or quality claims based on cstes projections and forecasts it appears to be ignoring the bottom and topline risks including the carrying value of its everincreasing inventory and finished goods competition is heating up globally with established producers increasingly competing for the same international market share examples being cambria  a big us quartz manufacturing company moving into international markets developing the strategic and operational structure for expanding sales marketing and distribution of cambria worldwide vadara quartz  another slab in the back for cste mr arik tendler is the former cste usa ceo and accredited with the expansion and early development of the company the former usa division ceo also appears to be a reader of spruce points research we speculate that arik tendler identified the issues and inferior levels of quartz in spruce points previous report page  mr tendler is now ceo of vadara quartz a relatively new brand within the quartz worktop market vadara appears to address quality issues spruce point has previously raised and that plague caesarstones online reviews crackingchipping staining and using chemicals which appear to be a deterrent to purchasing cstes worktops vadara quartz appears to have addressed concerns of consumers and tested their products to the following figure   extract from vadara quartz quality  performance claims key takeaways if production is ramping up in cstes new facility where is the demand for this agents we have contacted suggest that cste is not a quality product and most prefer to redirect us to other hard surface worktops some agents despite being registered as supplierscontact points to purchase cste products either do not sell it in some cases have never sold it or actually are registered distributors andor agents for other products we believe cste wants to give the impression of a company with greater reach depth and market share than the reality arik tendler accredited with the development and expansion of cste is now in direct competition with caesarstone  sec gets involved in ambiguous disclosures on september   the sec issued a request for further information in order to clarify a number of ambiguous statements in the companys f while these requests are sec filings attached to the cste ticker they are nowhere to be found on cstes sec filings section of its website managements address of revenue variance factors does not correlate with our channel checks specifically increased average selling prices do not reflect ground level pricing which we have found to be decreasing and excessive volume increases do not correspond to the consensus of cste resellers we contacted the average selling price  ikea ambiguities the sec questioned cstes revenue variance figure   sec query re ambiguity of revenue variance factors cste responded as follows figure   cste response to sec query re ambiguity of revenue variance factors the following years f provided insight into various metrics which we address below figure    revenue movement concerns forecasting competition with increased competition margin pressures and a sales network that needs serious updating its no wonder cste is the subject of sec enquiries relating to the inherent risks in its forecasts cstes financial forecasting is akin to holding its finger in the wind increased volume the consensus from the resellers we have contacted is that cste is not a quality product and many prefer to redirect us to other hard surface worktops we actively saw merchants moving away from this product how is it that the largest portion of cstes fy  growth was driven by increased volumes increased average selling price our comprehensive channel checks showed no increase in the prices of cste products at over the last two years in fact a review of ikeas catalogue shows that stock prices are generally decreasing figure   ikea sektion price list  fy  figure   ikea sektion price list  fy  figure   ikea sektion prices yoy note that level  items are a thinner ¾ thick product no contractors recommended buying quartz this thin as it was much more prone to cracking from impacts or weight  revenue movement concerns cste was also made to amend fy  revenue movement its explanation is as follows figure   revenue movement explanatory note unfavourable movements to the aud  cad canada and australia make up approximately  of cstes revenue or c m this end figure was negatively impacted by forex movement to the tune of   we question the implication that volume has offset an  move in forex we have already expressed our reservations on cstes alleged volume growth figure   segment revenue  ikea caesarstones highmargin cannibalization our extensive channel checks identified that cstes ikea offerings are also offered by independent contractors only ikeas prices its stock at an  discount to cste contractors retail price the contractor price list a usa based cste agent was kind enough to provide a copy of his retail price list of cste stock as follows figure   reseller retail price list the ikea sektion catalogue note that many of the above listed designs are also available at ikea page  figure   ikea sektion catalogue despite being identical products ikeas buyer catalogue is between  and  cheaper than the regular cste agents retail price and includes installation figure   ikea sektion quartz price list the consequence this business model raises two revenue cannibalization issues that benefit everyone except caesarstone the first obvious issue is who would willingly pay a premium price for an identical product given the choice especially an ikea product the answer is no one consumers will obviously opt for the low margin extremely cheap ikea product secondly resellers are increasingly discouraged to sell cste products opting instead for a highermargin premium products  silicosis  cost of doing business the elephant in the room silicosis liabilities have a significant range of assumption issues on the one hand the company made provisions for the legal action to date after insurance of circa m so far there had been no provisions for the classaction suit that was filed in  circa m the progress of this case is unknown to date prudence dictates that these legal claims should be risked into any price target going forward cste discreetly mentions that consistent with the experience of other companies involved in silicarelated litigation there may be an increase in the number of asserted claims against us  caesarstone vs silestone  financial comparison a comparative financial analysis against silestone aka cosentino reinforces our belief that caesarstones financial statements are misrepresented specifically caesarstones marketing expenses are remarkably low considering the company alleges to have over  times as many distributors in the usa as silestone caesarstones maintenance capex spending is substantially lower than silestones despite cstes higher revenues and cogs silestones margins are  higher suggesting less volume sold per unit of revenue and therefore lower wear  tear machinery expenses all quartz machinery incl frequent wear  tear replacement parts are bought from a niche group of suppliers with limited price variance we believe that cste is either not properly maintaining its assets or overstating its sales volume and revenue while ppe remains underutilized unlevered modeling exercise in order to make a fair comparison we have derived unlevered operational cash flows for both businesses over a fiveyear period  cste ending in fy  and silestone ending fy  as fy  results have not yet been released in order to remove the effects of growth we have estimated maintenance capex as the da recorded for the given year this is fundamentally the value of the assets that will have to be replaced in order for the businesses to continue their operations this analysis highlights what was already apparent at first glance of the accounts caesarstones free cash flow is inexplicably and illogically better than its competitors note that while we have modeled in cstes lower tax rate this does not affect our comparative analysis conclusions marketing expenses cstes marketing expenses have averaged around  of revenues over the last four years we derived marketing expenses from silestones account by way of elimination which appear to be in the region of  of its revenue over the last two years salaries accounted for the only other costs could be administration which given high salaries are presumably done inhouse and thus would not be recognised as external services in any case silestone has much higher opex overall per figure  below note we were unable to retrieve full financial statements for fy  only raw financial data sourced from sp capital iq as mentioned through this report cste has over  times more distributors than silestone cstes marketing expenses do not reflect this enormous client upkeep with a maintenance cost consequence this was reflected in our channel checks where a numerous cste listed agents simply did not sell the product figure   silestone cosentino financial statements fy  maintenance capex as a prelude all quartz manufacturers buy their machinery from a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers that are niche to the industry industry experts and competitors have advised that these machines suffer a measurable amount of wear and tear with parts requiring replacement after a given mileage think of tread on car tires it is therefore reasonable to assume that cstes depreciation and maintenance capex schedule would be very similar to its competitors it is not note that we are discussing maintenance capex not any other type of acquisition or expansion based investment outflows examples of which can be seen over figures  and  figure seq figure   cste fy  financial statements figure   cste fy  financial statements our analysis removed the capital structure effects on the business transaction costs minority interest earnings and onetime costs the results can be found on the next the page and are labeled figures  and  ebitda margins readers should also note that silestones ebitda margins have also declined by over  percentage points over the last five years reflecting the increasingly competitive market in which it operates despite having substantially lower gross margins almost  percentage points cstes ebitda has grown in the midst of competition and has overtaken cosentinos margins this means cste had to make up more than  percentage points of revenue in savings from marketing or staff cuts just to make up the proportional cogs difference between the two note cste figures are in usd cosentino figures are in eur figure   cosentino unlevered maintenance cash flow assumptions figure   cste unlevered maintenance cash flow assumptions comparison to actual figures cosentino spent c €m usm assuming a conservative €  us on ppe in fy  cosentino did not expand its operations in  figure   cosentino fy  statement of cash flows extract cosentinos sales in fy  were €m or usm in  which was a nonexpansionary year for cste it spent a mere usm on ppe figure    statement of cash flows extract as a means of comparison consider the following cstes fy  revenue was usm against usm by silestone in fy  cstes gross margin was  compared to silestones  given all the machinery and frequent wear and tear parts are provided by fitted and maintained by a limited number of niche suppliers with limited cost variables it is reasonable to presume that cost per unit of volume sold in both factories are the roughly the same silestones higher margin suggests less sales volume is required per us of revenue silestone would be expected to require less maintenance costs associated with wear and tear we note that the suppliers for the equipment are based in the eurozone however even the appreciation of the usd does not compensate for this massive discrepancy we have no idea how cste can spend so little on its capex but we can hazard a guess we believe maintenance is down because production is down either that or cste is failing to maintain its machines in good order both are equally damning we believe the sec is similarly suspicious on cstes incredible margins and low maintenance capex its issued a letter on  september  asking why us production lines and israel production lines are aggregated into a single reporting segment reducing visibility on utilisation of each plant figure   sec letter extract  september   we believe it would be prudent for the sec to persist in this matter as the financial evidence suggests that it is not feasible for cste to achieve its reported results we believe transparency into cstes reportable segments would ultimately prove our thesis  market data the gaping hole in cstes market penetration logic in each years financial statements cste gives a breakdown of global countertop markets and demand developed independently by freedonia market research which conducted the research on behalf of cste page  we have reservations on the accuracy of this data because contrary to cstes suggestions of independence freedonias data should not be considered independent freedonia source information from cste itself and is compensated for the data by cste freedonias pie charts do not reconcile with cstes revenues and alleged market penetration relevant data is as follows figure   global countertop market figure   geographical  material distribution figure   cste market penetration in key markets figure   cste market penetration in key markets consider the following you could calculate cstes alleged  quartz penetration in the usa backwards cstes north american revenue should be as follows according to freedonia data m is  of total revenues in fy  and  more than cstes reported north american segment revenue of m the pie charts provided by management separate geographies and countertop type demands based on volume not revenue however if we were to translate these pie charts into revenue we would expect that premium countertop materials granite marble and quartz would be more heavily weighed than nonpremium products laminate solid surface other as premium products are obviously more expensive for example where quartz represents  of countertops by volume we would expect it to represent  by revenue developed geographies would be more heavily weighted than less developed geographies for example we would expect a countertop to be more expensive in north america than in latin america or asia therefore north americas demand distribution of revenue would be greater than its distribution of volume ie  north americagranite would have a larger revenue relative to volumes making our calculations conservative we back tested these calculations using australian geographical data cstes australian segment comprises  of total revenue with market volume comprising allegedly  of global demand and where it claims to have  market penetration therefore cste alleges  market penetration in north america whilst this calculation does not consider countertop material preference by geography or even by volume it would certainly be a stretch to say that the product mix of surfaces in australia is so substantially different to that of the usa as the calculation is derived from australian figures the mismatch speaks volumes we believe either cstes performance is not correlated to the global market in which case the data is useless cstes market penetration figures are inflated in which case the data is wrong yearonyear quartz growth the surface demand mix increase yoy for quartz countertops appears extreme considering that there was an obvious recommendation and sales data channel checked countertop fitters which suggest a preference towards granite or quartz granite and quartz are the same price while quartz surface has grown in the product mix by  since  granites mix has stayed flat figure    global countertop demand by type figure    global countertop demand by type key takeaways we believe freedonias marketing material is a redundant exercise and the sec should seek more clarity into verification of cstes geographical segment data authentication of cstes market research data  market highlights some key points investors should be aware of stifel analysts recently march  upgraded the stock after its last earnings report cste has guided for lower earnings power this year yet the stock is up significantly ytd these are the same analysts who said buy in early  the peak prices cste has materially missed its capex costs for the georgia facility and continually revised earnings lower slide  of spruce point report details the repeated raising of capex guidance associated with the georgia plant we know now that the georgia plant has not performed up to expectations and been a drag on margins q results feb  company issues fy guidance expects continued growth taking into consideration among other items current exchange rates and the temporary inefficiencies associated with opening its new us manufacturing facility it expects its  revenues to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million stock moves higher q results august  reiterates full year adjusted ebitda guidance on lower revenue expectations the companys us manufacturing facility in richmond hill georgia remains on track with the first line in the us now operational and the second line in the us expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of  the company today reiterated its guidance for fullyear adjusted ebitda of  to  million and commented that it now expects to achieve that range with better than previously expected margins as a result of slightly lowerthanexpected us growth and the further negative impact of foreign exchange rates the company moderated its fullyear revenue guidance to a new range of  million to  million as compared to its prior range of  million to  million the stock corrects lower significantly spruce point report follows q results feb  issues disappointing guidance says the company is ramping up its us manufacturing facility in richmond hill georgia with both lines operating at a higher pace this ramp will enable the company to better serve the us market and support the companys ongoing growth announces buyback the stock declines significantly but bounces back on the support of the corporate buyback q may  company reiterates full year guidance stock rallies ceo shiran abandons what we believe is a sinking ship just  days after reiterating full year guidance nov   q cste revises  guidance downward significantly q results feb  cste issues guidance which shows revenue growth but a decline in adjusted ebitda and by extension eps the company issued guidance for the fullyear of  it expects its  revenue to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million the company promotes the lowes deal takeaway  looking back you can see this  ebitda range is even lower than the range that was forecasted in the same period in  cste stifel analyst ascribes a  improvement in numbers for the fullyear  they best get their skates on as near two quarters are over and we have found no evidence of cstes subpremium transform product at lowes march   stifel analyst upgrades to buy shares rallied post publication  conclusion due to the irregularities displayed in cstes accounts we
