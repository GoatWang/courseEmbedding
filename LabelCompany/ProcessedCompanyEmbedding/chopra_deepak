healthcentric condominium in manhattan the ideas chopra promotes have been regularly criticized by medical and scientific professionals as pseudoscience this criticism has been described as ranging from dismissive to damning for example robert carroll states chopra attempts to integrate ayurveda with quantum mechanics to justify his teachings chopra argues that what he calls quantum healing cures any manner of ailments including cancer through effects that he claims are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics this has led physicists to object to his use of the term quantum in reference to medical conditions and the human body his treatments benefit from the placebo response and some argue that his claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can lure

leader of the tm movement maharishi mahesh yogi who asked him to establish an ayurvedic health center he left his position at the nemh chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs when all you do is prescribe medication you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher that doesnt mean that all prescriptions are useless but it

when it became too stressful and was a hindrance to his success cynthia ann humes writes that the maharishi was concerned and not only with regard to chopra that rival systems were being taught at lower prices chopra for his part was worried that his close association with the tm movement might prevent ayurvedic medicine from being accepted as legitimate particularly after the problems with the

is estimated to be worth over  million as of update as of update according to srinivas aravamudan he was able to charge  to  per lecture five or six times a month medical anthropologist hans baer said chopra was an example of a successful entrepreneur but that he focused too much on serving the upperclass through an alternative to medical hegemony rather than a truly holistic approach to health

entrepreneur richard branson in  chopra was promoted from assistant professor to full professor at the university of california san diego in their department of family medicine ideas and receptionedit chopra believes that a person may attain perfect health a condition that is free from disease that never feels pain and that cannot age or die seeing the human body as being undergirded by a quantum mechanical body comprised not of matter but of energy and information he believes that human aging is fluid and changeable it can speed up slow down stop for a time and even reverse itself as determined by ones state of mind he claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease consciousnessedit chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics including the study of consciousness and vedanta philosophy he is a philosophical idealist arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature – that mind or dynamically active consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe in this view consciousness is both subject and object it is consciousness he writes that creates reality we are not physical machines that have somehow learned to thinkbut thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine he argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers the universe experiences itself through our brains we are the eyes of the universe looking at itself he has been quoted as saying charles darwin was wrong consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that he opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs desires memory and creativity in his book quantum healing chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe and therefore it must create consciousness approach to health care edit deepak chopra at the clinton health matters conference in la quinta california january   chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body with mental states thoughts feelings perceptions and memories directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine oxytocin and serotonin he has stated your mind your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions your personal relationships your environment how you deal with the environment and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … by influencing one you influence everything chopra and physicians at the chopra center practise integrative medicine combining the medical model of conventional western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing

is fluid and changeable it can speed up slow down stop for a time and even reverse itself as determined by ones state of mind he claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease consciousnessedit chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics including the study of consciousness and vedanta philosophy he is a philosophical idealist arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature – that mind or dynamically active consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe in this view consciousness is both subject and object it is consciousness he writes that creates reality we are not physical machines that have somehow learned to thinkbut thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine he argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers the universe experiences itself through our brains we are the eyes of the universe looking at itself he has been quoted as saying charles darwin was wrong consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that he opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs desires memory and creativity in his book quantum healing chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe and therefore it must create consciousness approach to health care edit deepak chopra at the clinton health matters conference in la quinta california january   chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body with mental states thoughts feelings perceptions and memories directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine oxytocin and serotonin he has stated your mind your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions your personal relationships your environment how you deal with the environment and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … by influencing one you influence everything chopra and physicians at the chopra center practise integrative medicine combining the medical model of conventional western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing material that was researched by sapolsky select

leader of the tm movement maharishi mahesh yogi who asked him to establish an ayurvedic health center he left his position at the nemh chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his

entrepreneur richard branson in  chopra was promoted from assistant professor to full professor at the university of california san diego in their department of family medicine ideas and receptionedit chopra believes that a person may attain perfect health a condition that is free from disease that never feels pain and that cannot age or die seeing the human body as being undergirded by a quantum mechanical body comprised not of matter but of energy and information he believes that human aging is fluid and changeable it can speed up slow down stop for a time and even reverse itself as determined by ones state of mind he claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease consciousnessedit chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics including the study of consciousness and vedanta philosophy he is a philosophical idealist arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature – that mind or dynamically active consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe in this view consciousness is both subject and object it is consciousness he writes that creates reality we are not physical machines that have somehow learned to thinkbut thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine he argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers the universe experiences itself through our brains we are the eyes of the universe looking at itself he has been quoted as saying charles darwin was wrong consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that he opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs desires memory and creativity in his book quantum healing chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe and therefore it must create consciousness approach to health care edit deepak chopra at the clinton health matters conference in la quinta california january   chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body with mental states thoughts feelings perceptions and memories directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine oxytocin and serotonin he has stated your mind your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions your personal relationships your environment how you deal with the environment and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … by influencing one you influence everything chopra and physicians at the chopra center practise integrative medicine combining the medical model of conventional western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing

never feels pain and that cannot age or die seeing the human body as being undergirded by a quantum mechanical body comprised not of matter but of energy and information he believes that human aging is fluid and changeable it can speed up slow down stop for a time and even reverse itself as determined by ones state of mind he claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease consciousnessedit chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics including the study of consciousness and vedanta philosophy he is a philosophical idealist arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature – that mind or dynamically active consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe in this view consciousness is both subject and object it is consciousness he writes that creates reality we are not physical machines that have somehow learned to thinkbut thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine he argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers the universe experiences itself through our brains we are the eyes of the universe looking at itself he has been quoted as saying charles darwin was wrong consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that he opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs desires memory and creativity in his book quantum healing chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe and therefore it must create consciousness approach to health care edit deepak chopra at the clinton health matters conference in la quinta california january   chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body with mental states thoughts feelings perceptions and memories directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine oxytocin and serotonin he has stated your mind your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions your personal relationships your environment how you deal with the environment and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … by influencing one you influence everything chopra and physicians at the chopra center practise integrative medicine combining the medical model of conventional western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing material that was researched by sapolsky select

leader of the tm movement maharishi mahesh yogi who asked him to establish an ayurvedic health center he left his position at the nemh chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his

entrepreneur richard branson in  chopra was promoted from assistant professor to full professor at the university of california san diego in their department of family medicine ideas and receptionedit chopra believes that a person may attain perfect health a condition that is free from disease that never feels pain and that cannot age or die seeing the human body as being undergirded by a quantum mechanical body comprised not of matter but of energy and information he believes that human aging is fluid and changeable it can speed up slow down stop for a time and even reverse itself as determined by ones state of mind he claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease consciousnessedit chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics including the study of consciousness and vedanta philosophy he is a philosophical idealist arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature – that mind or dynamically active consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe in this view consciousness is both subject and object it is consciousness he writes that creates reality we are not physical machines that have somehow learned to thinkbut thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine he argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers the universe experiences itself through our brains we are the eyes of the universe looking at itself he has been quoted as saying charles darwin was wrong consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that he opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs desires memory and creativity in his book quantum healing chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe and therefore it must create consciousness approach to health care edit deepak chopra at the clinton health matters conference in la quinta california january   chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body with mental states thoughts feelings perceptions and memories directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine oxytocin and serotonin he has stated your mind your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions your personal relationships your environment how you deal with the environment and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … by influencing one you influence everything chopra and physicians at the chopra center practise integrative medicine combining the medical model of conventional western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing

yoga mindfulness meditation and ayurveda according to ayurveda illness is caused by an imbalance in the patients doshas or humours and is treated with diet exercise and meditative practices – based on the medical evidence there is however nothing in ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease and some preparations may be actively harmful although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing in discussing health care chopra has used the term quantum healing which he defined in quantum healing  as the ability of one mode of consciousness the mind to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness the body this attempted to wed the maharishis version of ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics an example of what cultural historian kenneth zysk called new age ayurveda the book introduced chopras view that a persons thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a persons health imbalance is corrected by quantum mechanical means chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing he has attempted to integrate ayurveda a traditional indian system of medicine with quantum mechanics in order to justify his teachings according to robert carroll he charges  per lecture performance where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state corresponding to a jump to a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer physics professor robert l park has written that physicists wince at the new age quackery in chopras cancer theories and characterizes them as a cruel fiction since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure chopras claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a systematic misinterpretation of modern physics chopras connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid the main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible physicists have objected to chopras use of terms from quantum physics he was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics in  for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer in  on the question does god have a future harris argued that chopras use of spooky physics merged two language games in a completely unprincipled way interviewed in  by richard dawkins chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics chopra wrote in  that his aids patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on ayurveda including taking herbs meditation and yoga he acknowledges that aids is caused by the hiv virus but says that hearing the virus in its vicinity the dna mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion medical professor lawrence schneiderman writes that chopras treatment has to put it mildlyno supporting empirical data in  abc news aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer in it chopra said that there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between chopras periods of concentration and the subjects periods of relaxation after the show a poll of its viewers found that  of them believed in distance healing health and science journalist christopher wanjek has criticized the experiment saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed wanjek characterized the broadcast as an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news which had a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound alternative medicineedit see also maharishi vedic approach to health chopra has been described as americas most prominent spokesman for ayurveda his treatments benefit from the placebo response chopra states the placebo effect is real medicine because it triggers the bodys healing system chopra has metaphorically described the aids virus as emitting a sound that lures the dna to its destruction the condition can be treated according to chopra with ayurvedas primordial sound taking issue with this view medical professor lawrence schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that to put it mildly dr chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for aids that has no supporting empirical data he is placed by david gorski among the quacks cranks and purveyors of woo and described as arrogantly obstinate the new york times in  stated that deepak chopra is the controversial new age guru and booster of alternative medicine the time magazine stated that he is the poetprophet of alternative medicine he has become one of the bestknown and wealthiest figures in the holistichealth movement the times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims in  time magazine included chopra in its list of the th centurys heroes and icons the following year mikhail gorbachev referred to him as one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time cosmo landesman wrote in  that chopra was hardly a man now more a lucrative new age brand – the david beckham of personalspiritual growth a  time magazine article by ptolemy tompkins commented that for most of his career chopra had been a magnet for criticism and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals opinions ranged from the dismissive to the outright damning chopras claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can some have argued lure sick people away from medical treatments tompkins however considered chopra a beloved individual whose basic messages centered on love health and happiness had made him rich because of their popular appeal english professor george ohar argues that chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives and places what he calls chopras sophistries alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey paul kurtz writes that chopras regnant spirituality is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science while wendy kaminer equates chopras views with irrational belief systems such as new thought christian science and scientology agingedit chopra believes that ageing is simply learned behaviour that can be slowed or prevented chopra has said that he expects to live way beyond  he states that by consciously using our awareness we can influence the way we age biologicallyyou can tell your body not to age conversely chopra also says that ageing can be accelerated for example by a person engaging in cynical mistrust robert todd carroll has characterized chopras promotion of lengthened life as a selling of hope that seems to be a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish spirituality and religionedit chopra has likened the universe to a reality sandwich which has three layers the material world a quantum zone of matter and energy and a virtual zone outside of time and space which is the domain of god and from which god can direct the other layers chopra has written that human beings brains are hardwired to know god and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by jiddu krishnamurti a thcentury speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects in  reviewing war of the worldviews – a book coauthored by chopra and leonard mlodinow – physics professor mark alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors covering all the big questions cosmology life and evolution the mind and brain and god alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition and says that the counterpoint to chopras speculations is not science with its complicated structure of facts theories and hypotheses but rather occams razor in august  chopra wrote a series of articles on the creationevolution controversy and intelligent design which were criticized by science writer michael shermer founder of the skeptics society in  shermer said that chopra is the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience position on skepticismedit paul kurtz an american skeptic and secular humanist has written that the popularity of chopras views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new alternative forms of validation for ideas kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to openminded but proper scrutiny and that skepticism has its work cut out for it in  chopra published an article on what he saw as skepticism at work in wikipedia arguing that a stubborn band of militant skeptics were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as rupert sheldrake an author lecturer and researcher in parapsychology the result chopra argued was that the encyclopedias readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to expand science beyond its conventional boundaries the biologist jerry coyne responded saying that it was instead chopra who was losing out as his views were being exposed as a lot of scientificallysounding psychobabble more broadly chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole writing in the huffington post that no skeptic to my knowledge ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others astronomer phil plait said this statement trembled on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie listing carl sagan richard feynman stephen jay gould and edward jenner among the thousands of scientists who are skeptics who he said were counterexamples to chopras statement use of scientific terminologyedit see also quantum mysticism reviewing susan jacobys book the age of american unreason wendy kaminer sees chopras popular reception in the usa as being symptomatic of many americans historical inability as jacoby puts it to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science chopras nonsensical references to quantum physics are placed in a lineage of american religious pseudoscience extending back through scientology to christian science physics professor chad orzel has written that to a physicist chopras babble about energy fields and congealing quantum soup presents as utter gibberish but that chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince nonscientists that he understands physics english professor george ohar writes that chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need magic in their lives and places the sophistries of chopra alongside the emotivism of oprah winfrey the special effects and logic of star trek and the magic of harry potter chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement decoherence and the heisenberg uncertainty principle in  chopra was awarded the satirical ig nobel prize in physics for his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life liberty and the pursuit of economic happiness when interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist richard dawkins in the channel  uk documentary the enemies of reason chopra said that he used the term quantum physics as a metaphor and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics in march  chopra and jean houston debated sam harris and michael shermer at the california institute of technology on the question does god have a future shermer and harris criticized chopras use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts a  paper examining the reception and detection of pseudoprofound bullshit used chopras twitter feed as the canonical example and compared this with fake chopra quotes generated by a spoof website yogaedit in april  aseem shukla cofounder of the hindu american foundation criticized chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in hinduism but in an older indian spiritual tradition chopra later said that yoga was rooted in consciousness alone expounded by vedic rishis long before historic hinduism ever arose he accused shukla of having a fundamentalist agenda shukla responded by saying chopra was an exponent of the art of how to deconstruct repackage and sell hindu philosophy without calling it hindu and he said chopras mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate legal actionsedit in may  the journal of the american medical association jama published an article by chopra and two others on ayurvedic medicine and tm jama subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author hari m sharma had undisclosed financial interests followed by an article by jama associate editor andrew a skolnick which was highly critical of chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject several experts on meditation and traditional indian medicine criticized jama for accepting the shoddy science of the original article chopra and two tm groups sued skolnick and jama for defamation asking for  million in damages but the case was dismissed in march  chopra was sued for copyright infringement by robert sapolsky for using a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress without proper attribution after the publication of chopras book ageless body timeless mind an outofcourt settlement resulted in chopra correctly attributing material that was researched by sapolsky select

universe is a theory proposed by renowned scientist robert lanza this theory explains that life and biology are the central pieces to being reality and the cosmos it explains how life creates the universe rather than the other way around biocentrism builds upon the ideas of quantum physics while physics is considered essential to the study of the universe and chemistry essential to the study of life biocentrism puts biology before all other sciences in order to develop a theory of everything – a theory of the universe when describing this theory robert lanza explains that what we call space and time are forms of animal sense perception rather than external physical objects understanding this simple yet revolutionary idea provides us with new ways to answer some of the major puzzles of mainstream science biocentrism offers a new way of understanding everything from the microworld to the forces constants and laws that shape our entire universe in  leading scientist robert lanza and astronomer bob berman published their first book on biocentrism entitled biocentrism how life and consciousness are the keys to understanding the true nature of the universe the book opened the eyes of readers from all across the globe providing a new perspective to how the universe came to be in the past physics has dominated the topic of the universe in western science with biocentrism robert lanza switches the focus to biology exclaiming that life is not just an accidental by product of the laws of physics instead it suggests the invigorating possibility that life is fundamentally immortal recently robert lanza and bob berman published their second book on biocentrism beyond biocentrism rethinking time space consciousness and the illusion of death in this new book lanza and berman take the reader on yet another intellectual and thrilling journey as they reexamine everything we once thought we knew about life death the universe and the nature of reality itself the book starts out by acknowledging that our current model of reality is beginning to look more and more worn and outdated in the face of new scientific discoveries scientists has been able to determine that over  of the universe is composed almost entirely of dark matter and dark energy however scientists must also confess that they are not entirely sure what dark matter is knowing even less about dark energy with this in mind science is increasingly pointing towards an infinite universe the problem is we still do not have the ability to explain what the really means the book beyond biocentrism is meant to challenge us to fully accept the implications of the latest scientific findings in a number of areas including plant biology cosmology quantum entanglement and even our own consciousness listening to the latest scientific findings it seems to become more and more clear that life and consciousness are truly fundamental to any real understanding of the universe this forces us to rethink everything we thought we knew about life death and our own place in the universe stay tuned for the latest updates and news on biocentrism lanzas paper is the cover story of annalen der physik which published einsteins theories of relativity on decoherence in quantum gravity in his papers on relativity einstein showed that time was relative to the observer this new paper takes this one step further arguing that the observer creates it the paper shows that the intrinsic properties of quantum gravity and matter alone cannot explain the tremendous effectiveness of the emergence of time and the lack of quantum entanglement in our everyday world instead it’s necessary to include the properties of the observer and in particular the way we process and remember information wired read morediscover magazine read more robert lanza md robert lanza md is one of the most respected scientists in the world—a us news  world report cover story called him a genius and renegade thinker even likening him to einstein lanza is a professor at wake forest university and was recognized by time magazine in  on its list of the  most influential people in the world prospect magazine named him one of the top  world thinkers in  rethinking time space consciousness and the illusion of death biocentrism shocked the world with a radical rethinking of the nature of reality but that was just the beginning beyond biocentrism is an enlightening and fascinating journey that will forever alter your understanding of your own existence—deepak chopra  beyond biocentrism is a joyride through the history of science and cuttingedge physics all with a very serious purpose to find the longoverlooked connection between the conscious self and the universe around us—corey s powell former editorinchief discover magazine how life and consciousness are the keys to understanding the true nature of the universe dont miss the book that started it all and shocked the world with its radical rethinking of the nature of reality in biocentrism robert lanza and bob berman team up to turn the planet upside down with the revolutionary view that life creates the universe instead of the other way around  biocentrism takes the reader on a seemingly improbable but ultimately inescapable journey through a foreign universe‒our own‒from the viewpoints of an acclaimed biologist and a leading astronomer it will shatter the readers ideas of lifetime and space and even death … the reader will never see reality the same again  like a brief history of time it is indeed stimulating and brings biology into the whole any short statement does not do justice to such a scholarly work… most importantly it makes you think—nobel prize winner e donnall thomas more about biocentrism what happens when you die life is an adventure that transcends our ordinary linear way of thinking the secret of life a parable of matter mind and the ubiquity of life free abridgement of biocentrism how life creates the universe authors say cosmology misses the big picture unless it includes biology the biocentric universe theory life creates time space and the cosmos itself stemcell guru robert lanza presents a radical new view of the universe  everything in it lanza on biocentrism robert lanzas talk on biocentrism at the science  nonduality conference a new theory of the universe biocentrism
