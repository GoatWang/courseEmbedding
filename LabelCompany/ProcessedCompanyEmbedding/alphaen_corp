metal at room temperature green technology driven by the transition to a low carbon economy an innovative clean tech company αen™ lithium metal products lowest cost highest purity cleanest technology reducing raw material costs  the key to profitability for battery companies top notch team experience leadership success a  pairing of corporate and scientific expertise clean technology cutting costs and the carbon footprint our proprietary process enables the production of pure lithium metal at a significant cost savings lithium metal batteries lithium metal power up the recent increase in demand for lithium is due to major advances in battery technology lithium is the lightest of all metals and has the highest electrochemical potential making it the choice raw material for batteries virtually all approaches that affect a substantial increase of the energy density of rechargeable batteries beyond that of lithiumion batteries require the use of a lithium metal anode alphaen’s lithium metal is purer than what is currently available on the market free of all base metals and common nonconductive impurities found in the existing commercial supply we produce our lithium using a room temperature process that does not require or release noxious chemicals our process allows for the flexible deposition and intercalation of lithium into custom substrates which streamlines the manufacturing of batteries of all sizes the flexibility of our process allows for production of lithium and compounds in a variety of form factors for use in primary and rechargeable batteries these batteries have applications across many different markets our product is especially relevant in markets that depend on batteries that provide very high energy densities for long useful life in comparatively lightweight packages such as the consumer electronic and automotive markets read more clean technology our room temperature proprietary patent pending process was developed by alphaen’s research team in  this novel process is mercury and chlorine free eliminating the use and release of toxic chemicals and expensive containment costs our process enables alphaen to manufacture pure lithium metal at a significant cost savings  in the united states saving us battery manufactures vat and associated import costs lower processing temperatures substantially reduce production costs and carbon emissions read more expert leadership – always innovating alphaen‘s chairman and founder has a proven track record identifying new technologies and bringing them to market including the soft contact lens surgical staples and high silica glass to store nuclear waste strategic partners include argonne national laboratory and princeton university our top notch scientific team includes a nobel prize winning chemist read more company profile alphaencorp has invented a patent pending process for the production of pure lithium at room temperature in addition to its environmental benefits this process is the only known method to produce lithium in “thin film” form meaning film thinner than  micron lithium that is the result of alphaen’s technology has a very unique morphology and is of unprecedented purity that is why the alphaen research team believes alphaen lithium will lend itself to the development of a proprietary lithium metal anode that will help to enable the next

scientific expertise the alphaen corporation is an innovative clean technology company focused on enabling next generation battery technologies by developing and bringing to market pure state of the art materials produced in an environmentally sustainable manner led by jerome i feldman since  alphaen has been primarily focused on developing sustainable technologies to produce the purest lithium metal for use in batteries and the nuclear power industry in june of  alphaen’s rd team developed a new patent pending process conducted at room temperature to produce pure lithium alphaen has created a carbon neutral technology that is cheaper to produce and has a much greater energy density this will allow battery manufacturers to create much more powerful batteries at a fraction of the cost without harming the environment in july of  alphaen began a series of tests to determine if lithium metal could be consistently extracted from lithium carbonate utilizing our patent pending process the results were successful in april of  the technology was validated by a prestigious university confirming alpha’s results strategic partners  development argonne national laboratory has entered into a collaborative  agreement with alphaen to assist in the scale and optimization of our process  argonne’s vast resources and world class team of experienced  process engineers chemists and materials scientists have a proven track record of advancing technologies alphaen is sponsoring rd at princeton university under the supervision of daniel steingart phd assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the andlinger center for energy and the environment at princeton the team will study the deposition and transport mechanisms enabled by the alphaen process allowing us to broaden the application of the company’s core technology since january  the company has been sponsoring research at the city university of new york’s  cuny newly constructed scientific laboratories the advanced science research center under the direction of professor stephen o’brien professor o’brien leads a team of researchers investigating the most efficient ways to deposit and intercalate lithium onto custom substrates  the cuny team and other technologies to produce our pure lithium metal in a variety of form factors to meet market demands clean lithium a subsidiary of alphaen was formed in september of  for the purpose of commercializing our novel pure lithium products always innovating alphaen is developing a range of products derived from our core technology mr feldman believes using clean technology throughout the battery supply chain is the key to an exponential reduction in carbon emissions as batteries become the economic impetus in the transition to a low carbon economy clean processing technologies are imperative company profile alphaencorp has invented a patent pending process for the production of pure lithium at room temperature in addition to
