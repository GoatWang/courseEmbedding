powdered metal alloys are forced through an oxyacetylene guntype torch the powder is melted and the propelled in a molten state at the parts surface yields an instant solidification and a mechanical bond between the coating and substrate the coating is then fused to the substrate to obtain a permanent molecular bond normally recommended for new and not salvaged worn parts because of the high temperatures attained in the fusing process 9°f to °f may cause warpage is more economical to apply than rodwelded or plasma coatings because of the applications rapidity and the coatings controllable

fisher products llc plasma transferred arc stellite starweld  pta plasma transferred arc pta is an overlay welding process with deposits that are homogenous and fused to the substrate forming a metallurgical bond plasma transferred arc makes use of a constricted arc and powdered alloy which is carried from a feeder to the plasma torch in a stream of argon gas the powder is then directed away from the torch into the effluent arc where it is melted and fused to the base metal in a single rapid pass produces deposits between  and  thick and allows close control of penetration note a single pass however commonly results in a  to  dilution of the substrate in the deposit  a dilution that will generally weaken the hardness range of the coating by rc therefore many designengineers specify a twopass minimum with the added requirement that not less than half of the second pass be machined away  includes a variety of nickelbase cobaltbase and ironbase alloy powders all services  processes

president of field operations for the company                    mr jan fisher senior is the founder of the omnione group of pennsylvania llc in  while undergoing rehabilitation for major back surgery mr fisher was approached by a women who due to the recent amputation of her leg became dependent on her powered  wheelchair to complete daily activities she shared a frightening story that one day while crossing a busy street in an area of pittsburgh called east liberty she found her self caught in the midst of a summer storm and then her wheelchair suddenly became inoperable this left the women stranded in the middle of street it was determined the cause of the failure was because water entered the control panel resulting in a shortcircuit at the time the women was using a plastic shopping bag to protect the control panel because there were next to no reliable covers available and touched by her story mr jan fisher sr decided as a former trouble shooter in the electrical industry and once taking a closer view of the system he then took some cellophane scissors and scotch tape and began to carefully wrapped her joystick control panel and instead of going over the joystick controller stem mr fisher went under and around the joystick shaft an after being asked if he could make a more permanent cover and then through many months then years of research on hismaterials he then registered his patent applicationand on february th of  three days after mr fishers 9th birthday he was informed by his patent attorney that the industry needed his device because of the manner in which it was designed and the safety features that was approved by the food an drug administration fda and be for the patent was finalized now tell me isnt our god good yes our
