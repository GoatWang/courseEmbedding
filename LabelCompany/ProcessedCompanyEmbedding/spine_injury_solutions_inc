step was not going to happen overnight since that time a lot has been accomplished both from standardizing documentation to include compiling  affiliate operations manual and legal affiliate

largest personal injury law firms though the announcement was preliminary and had little detail the local lubbock newspaper picked up on the announcement attracting other doctors and  local law firms who had heard of spin and its quad video halo™ and already are referring patients though such a short time more than a dozen lubbock patients have already been referred with response such as we have witnessed in lubbock the company has set a target to add as many as ten to twelve affiliates over the next  months it is not unrealistic to assume that a goal of  spinal procedures a month after six

march   globe newswire — spine injury solutions inc announces lubbock tx affiliate location under its new affiliate expansion program houston march   — spine injury solutions inc inc otcqbspin a technologydriven medical service and healthcare solution company servicing the multibillion dollar spine injury sector today announced the addition of a new affiliate program to be located in lubbock tx seven years ago spin initiated its first affiliate program in houston tx whereby spin would provide funding assistance to independent healthcare providers who provide diagnostic and treatment procedures for patients with spine injury accidents in many cases the reimbursements for these medical treatments took several years depending on the settlement timing of the case for these reasons spin developed programs to fund the affilates case billings after the procedure is completed at a discount and assume risk of future collection during these seven years while averaging three affiliates over  procedures have been funded generating some  million in reported net revenues for spin actual cash collections to date from spin funded cases have exceeded  million why spin is now expanding its affiliate program nationally in early  spin began beta testing of a unique video transparency and documenting device called quad video halo™ qvh in  it received its us patent on the qvh and began medical safety certification testing in  rd party testing was successfully completed and the qvh became certified for medical use in both the us and eu since adding the qvh to its affiliate program almost  cases have been funded included in the new affiliate program is training based on spin’s business model in many cases there is minimal cash outlay to the independent healthcare providers other than a monthly cloud storage for all procedures involving the qvh the independent healthcare provider may offer spin the option to fund all cases which used the qvh spin has been advised by some attorneys that the use of the qvh helps expedite the settlement of the case william f donovan md chairman ceo of spine injury solutions inc said “costs associated with accident victims total in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually much of this cost is attributable to delayed or improper early diagnosis of the injury causing unnecessary long term problems and costs with over  years’ experience as a board certified orthopedic surgeon i have evaluated many cases that would not have required unnecessary treatments if early diagnosis would have been made i came to the conclusion that lack of proper ‘tools’ rather than medical incompetency was the cause in the delay for patients to receive appropriate necessary and reasonable treatment this led to the development of the spin affiliate program with its appropriate protocols and most importantly the qvh” having been one of the first surgeons in the country to use video in arthroscopic surgery i felt there was a need to provide video documentation for accident victim procedures for this reason spin has invested some  million in developing and putting into service its proprietary qvh v to date the qvh has been used on some  cases providing transparency for procedures performed about spine injury solutions inc we are a medical services and technology company facilitating diagnostic services for patients who

multibillion dollar spine injury sector through its chairmanceo dr william donovan md is pleased to announce the formation of advisory board with texas based personal injury pi law specialist lawrence m tylka as chairman additional members are expected to be empaneled over the next several weeks tylka founder of the tylka law firm has practiced in the houston tx area for over  years having begun his pi career as a defense attorney representing major liability insurance companies tylka left the defense firm to join a very successful personal injury law firm in  he eventually became the managing attorney of that firm on galveston island in august of  larry started his own law firm on galveston island while the office may be located on galveston island he has been able to enjoy a statewide practice and handle cases in other states and participate in the handling of cases in other countries such as mexico and honduras the decision by spin to form the advisory board with tylka as head was made by management based on tylka’ strong passion for and highly successful use of spin’s quad video halo qvh over the past two years from the beginning of beta testing as a former personal injury defense attorney and subsequently multiyear member of the “million dollar advocates forum” representing injury victims tylka is a strong advocate willing to publically share his strong endorsement of qvh he is openly willing to share that qvh is the tool that has significantly increased his victim’s settlements and considerably reduced time to resolution but even more important he feels that with the use of qvh comfort is being provided victims that “best practices of medicine” are being observed and documented though spin’s proprietary qvh video protocol to quote tylka at a recent meeting “once made aware of it i can’t see why any personal injury attorney would not want to use qvh” dr donovan stated “i have known and worked with larry for many years with his vast experience in personal injury law from both initially as an insurance industry advocate and now an advocate for the victim his advice guidance and perspective contributed in the development of the qvh has been invaluable investors first heard from larry as guest panelist on our q  investors conference call heaping accolades on spin based on his own successful use of the qvh video in expediting case settlements at considerably higher levels than before since that time his selfless willingness to help ‘spread the word’ of his success to the legal community has given us confidence that the time was now right to expand our very successful local ‘affiliate’ program nationally his willingness to ‘attach’ his name and reputation directly to spin and qvh by “chairing” our new advisory board is solid

video halo™ qvh video medical records technology vmrt paired with its successful seven year history of injury case financing delivered through three contracted “affiliates” the stage has now been set for a nationwide expansion of its unique new affiliate program adding a hightech advantage to injured accident victims  houston feb   globe newswire — spine injury solutions inc otcqbspin a technologydriven medical service finance  and healthcare solution company servicing the multibillion dollar spine injury sector through its chairmanceo dr william donovan md is pleased to report that the company’s attendance and speaker participation at the preannounced james j mathis “personal injury understanding colossus seminar” in atlanta ga february   was a success in several aspects the seminar attendees primarily made up of healthcare providers and attorneys servicing the  personal injury pi industry were introduced most for the first time to spin’s proprietary patented quad video halo™ v and its success in facilitating patient confidence “best medical practices” and higher case settlements in shorter time for cases involving diagnostic and treatment injections the original beta qvh first began clinic testing and trials in  in houston tx with northshore orthopedics nso spin’s first “affiliate” owned by spin founderchairman nso along with several satellite locations using spin’s medical lien financing program since  had up until the first use of qvh in  financed over  diagnostic injection procedures in the conventional nontechnical way similar to what the rest of the country uses today while under continuing testing and development the qvh received its us patent in  and its successful completion of compliance testing of the quad video halo system to meet en  safety standard for medical equipment along with its eu approval to carry the ce mark in  spin has internally invested approximately  million in developing the qvh which has now been used and proven successful in an additional  case procedures early on in the testing of the qvh second and third spin affiliates were added in midlandodessa and tyler tx who contributed to the latter  procedures armed with data and both medical and attorney testimonials giving clear “proof of concept” to the conjoining of the qvh v with conventional spine injection procedures spin management made the decision in late  to develop a new  nationwide allencompassing affiliate program to be introduced for the first time at the atlanta seminar new spin affiliates once qualified and accepted will be trained to provide best practices be referred cases generated by spin paidfor marketing and trained in the use of spin’s qvh all provided at no additional cost to their existing practices  once the procedures are completed spin will early monetize the affiliates case billing leaving no further collection risk the new affiliate program capitalizes on spin’s unique position in having exclusive access to its patented qvh when the decision was made in december to expand its affiliate program the targets were to add a minimum of four affiliates with two in atlanta and maximum of  affiliates over the following year  the company is pleased to report significant interest in the program by over  attendees mostly from atlanta but also from four additional states making the high end of the target range appear very achievable additionally –though the qvh was originally developed for internal spin affiliate use while under continuing development it was  realized that a large additional market existed a market for instantly transportable high definition video providing transparency could be much broader  for example there is a need for  a hybrid video integration platform for general surgery not only for qvh’s own four camera video showing internal xray realtime view along with three external cameras but also to piggyback additional video devices qvh also has builtin capabilities to plugin any digital or analog video medical device with “video out” capabilities devices used in robotic arthroscopic microscopic etc surgical procedures both for risk management or use in hospitals and cadaver labs for global education can work with the qvh though direct sales were not the primary target at the atlanta seminar management also reports significant third party nonpi interest in the qvh such as described above from three attendees dr donovan stated “on behalf of the spin and qvh management directors and development team i cannot overstate how pleased we were with the reception we received from not just the attendees but even the sponsors and other presenters at atlanta we anticipate adding and announcing new team members shortly “ donovan added “for those not familiar with spin’s history it should be noted that since inception some seven years ago spin’s business advances to include the qvh development have been financed through its own organic revenues sporadic third party straight debt paid off on time and some early loans by me later exchanged for shares spin has never asked for or received any outside equity financing public or private while i am the largest shareholder of the company the vast majority of my shares were either purchased in the open market or early loans i made to the company which i converted to restricted shares at market value the majority by far of my share purchases andor debt conversions were at prices higher than the current share price” about spine injury solutions inc we are a medical services and technology company
