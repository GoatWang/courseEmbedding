of foley advisers about fatca the new us tax regime designed to combat offshore tax evasion by us taxpayers that will go into effect on january    our prior installments described fatca compliance for  us standalone funds and us feeder funds with only us investors part one click here and  us master funds with offshore feeder funds that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes part two click here  this part three focuses on preliminary fatca compliance for offshore master funds with onshore and offshore feeder funds – for example a cayman islands master treated as a partnership for us tax purposes with a delaware limited partnership feeder and a cayman islands feeder treated as a corporation for us tax purposes  the following discussion assumes that the offshore master fund is required to be fatcacompliant offshore funds  master and feeder the specific fatca compliance obligations of an offshore master fund or an offshore feeder fund will depend on the country in which such offshore fund is organized  the united states currently is in the process of concluding fatcarelated intergovernmental agreements “igas” with countries throughout the world based on two model agreements  the model  iga and the model  iga   an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will refer to the applicable model  iga and local law to determine its fatca compliance requirements  in contrast an offshore fund organized in either a model  jurisdiction or in a country that is not a party to an iga generally will refer to the us fatca regulations to determine its fatca compliance requirements regardless of whether your offshore fund is located in a country that is a model  model  or noniga jurisdiction you must take the following preliminary steps registration  you must register each offshore fund entity with the irs using the online “fatca registration portal” which will be accessible through the irs’s website no later than july     upon successful registration each of the offshore funds will receive a global intermediary identification number “giin” a special taxpayer identification number for fatca purposes and its name and giin will be included in an online list of fatcacompliant entities that will be first published in december  and then will be updated on a monthly basis fatca agreement  as part of the registration process an offshore fund that is organized in a model  or noniga jurisdiction will be required to enter into an agreement with the irs pursuant to which the offshore fund will agree to undertake certain due diligence obligations with respect to its current and future owners submit information returns to the irs with respect to certain us owners and conduct withholding on payments or allocations of certain ussource income to nonus entity owners that fail to comply with fatca irs form w  the offshore master fund must maintain a valid irs form w for its us feeder fund in its files irs form w  once the offshore funds have registered and obtained their giins each offshore fund should immediately complete a new “postfatca” irs form w the offshore master fund should maintain a valid “postfatca” irs form w for the offshore feeder fund in its files and verify on an ongoing basis that the offshore feeder fund and its giin continue to be included in the published irs list of   fatcacompliant entities in addition the offshore master fund should prepare its own valid “postfatca” irs form w and furnish it to entities in which it invests if required if the offshore master fund invests in another entity that is a “withholding agent” for fatca purposes such as an unrelated us investment fund or an unrelated nonus investment fund that is subject to fatca in a fundoffunds structure and such investment was or is made prior to january   you generally will have a grace period until june   to provide the offshore master fund’s “postfatca” irs form w and giin to the withholding agent in order to avoid the fatca withholding tax   in contrast if the offshore master fund makes an initial investment in an entity that is a withholding agent on or after january   you generally will have  days from the date on which the offshore master fund acquires the interest to provide this information to the withholding agent regardless of the applicable deadlines you should begin the fatca registration process  with respect to existing offshore funds as soon as possible after registration opens in july  and  with respect to offshore funds formed after the fatca registration portal becomes accessible as soon as possible thereafter onshore feeder fund in order to ensure that the onshore feeder fund is fatcacompliant you should follow the procedures in part one click here if the onshore feeder fund has only us investors or the procedures in part two click here if the onshore feeder fund has us and nonus investors  in either case the onshore feeder fund should provide the offshore master fund with a valid irs form w if it has not done so already the foregoing discussion is limited to the preliminary fatca compliance obligations of offshore masterfeeder structures  offshore entities that must be fatcacompliant will have additional ongoing obligations to maintain their compliance with fatca  you should review your fund and subscription documents to ensure that they contain appropriate provisions to enable the offshore master fund and its onshore and offshore feeder funds to fulfill their additional fatca compliance obligations including provisions requiring investors to provide any needed information under fatca fatca compliance is casespecific  if you would like more detailed information regarding fatca please contact kip cawley rick schaulyoder nicola lemay or your foley hoag lawyer  not all foreign entities must be fatcacompliant many factors including source and type of income affiliations with other foreign entities and business relationships may affect the determination of whether a foreign entity must be fatcacompliant an analysis of these factors and a discussion of this determination are outside the scope of this foley adviser↩  most countries in which offshore funds typically are organized including the cayman islands and the british virgin islands have executed or currently are negotiating model  igas↩  we will publish another foley adviser regarding access to the portal after the irs makes the information available↩  even if an offshore fund completes the registration process in july  the irs will not begin issuing giins until october ↩  an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will not be required to enter into a fatca agreement but will have similar responsibilities under the applicable model  iga and local law including the obligation to collect information about its owners and furnish information to its local taxing authority with respect to certain us owners which information then will be shared with the irs↩  existing versions of irs form w are not sufficient the irs intends to issue new versions of form w specifically for fatca purposes we will publish another foley adviser with links to these “postfatca” forms w after the irs makes the final versions of such forms available↩  the applicable grace period for offshore funds with pre investments in nonus entities organized in iga jurisdictions may vary depending upon the terms of the applicable iga↩  these deadlines also apply to offshore feeder funds and are based on the date an offshore feeder fund acquires its interest in an offshore master fund↩ written by christopher r k
