skip to content homeabout book and other articles presentations related links ← why louis freeh should be investigated for  forgetting torture lee hamilton john brennan and abu zubaydah → the case against ralph eberhart norad’s  commander posted on january   by kevin ryan in a  us senate hearing senator mark dayton remarked that “this country and its citizens were completely undefended” for “ minutes” on   dayton went on to clarify that officials within the north american aerospace defense command norad had covered up the facts about the lack of air defenses by lying to the  commission to congress and to the american people and they were not held accountable one man was most responsible for both the air defense failures and the lying that covered it up  us air force general ralph edward eberhart had taken over command of norad from general richard myers in february   the position included leadership of all air defense operations in north america and also the us space command  therefore on  eberhart was the man most responsible for failure to intercept the four hijacked aircraft over a period of nearly two hours norad is the joint uscanadian military organization responsible for monitoring and defending the airspace over north america  longstanding operating procedures at norad for dealing with airliners that have gone offcourse or been hijacked were not followed on   each of the four flights involved in the  attacks should have been intercepted when they lost radio contact deviated from their course or turned off their transponders the procedures for interception were automatic and required no special orders to implement through these procedures interceptor jets had been scrambled  times in the year  and  times in the year prior to june   a  government report stated — “overall during the past four years norad’s alert fighters took off to intercept aircraft referred to as scrambled  times or an average of  times per site per year of these incidents the number of suspected drug smuggling aircraft averaged … less than  percent of all of the alert sites’ total activity the remaining activity generally involved visually inspecting unidentified aircraft and assisting aircraft in distress” on  the norad interception system failed completely and we have been given multiple conflicting explanations for why that happened  considering that there is strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis of insider involvement in  it is reasonable to assume that an intentional compromising of the us air defenses might have occurred that day  adding to this suspicion is the fact that guilt tends to be reflected in false testimony  and as senator dayton said norad officials “lied to the american people they lied to congress and they lied to your  commission” exactly which norad statements were lies and which were not is a matter that is still not clear to this day  this is partly because the explanations and testimony that are now said to have been false were far more damning to norad than the final account which exonerates norad entirely  why would norad leaders want to lie so as to make their performance look worse in order to better determine the facts investigators should begin with at least three areas of inquiry  the times at which norad was notified or made aware of the hijackings  the times at which norad responded in the form of scrambling jets to intercept and  the instructions given to the interceptor pilots in terms of speed and direction norad’s everchanging story the military’s explanations began with a short description of the response to the hijackings  two days after the attacks general richard myers gave this account to the senate armed services committee in an official hearing for his confirmation as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs  he said that no fighter jets were scrambled to intercept any of the hijacked  flights until after the pentagon was hit although myers was not in command of norad on  he should have known two days later if normal procedures had been followed  as acting cjcs on  and as vice chairman otherwise his role was to ensure the president and secretary of defense were informed of critical military matters a second story was given a week after the attacks when norad provided a partial timeline of the notifications it had received from the federal aviation administration faa and the responses that followed  general eberhart reiterated this timeline in testimony to the us senate a few weeks later and for over two years it stood as the official account  this timeline said that norad had received notification about three of the hijacked planes with plenty of time left to ensure interception and had scrambled jets from multiple bases as the attacks proceeded the new timeline showed that norad was notified about the hijacking of flight  at  am a full twenty minutes before it impacted the south tower of the world trade center wtc  moreover f interceptor jets from otis air force base afb were said to be airborne by  having been scrambled in response to the first hijacking  this allowed twice the time needed for the jets to reach new york city before flight  crashed eberhart added that norad was notified about the hijacked flight  coming into washington at  am fourteen minutes before it impacted the pentagon  he told the senate armed services committee repeatedly that this was a “documented notification”  if true interceptor jets from andrews afb only ten miles from the pentagon could have easily reached the errant airliner given this lead time although the military might now use the excuse that andrews was not technically under the command of norad the  commissions says eberhart’s statement was simply not true  in fact both commission counsel dan marcus and team leader john farmer were later very blunt about this being a false statement  therefore it is clear that eberhart should be brought up on a charge of contempt of congress  it is illegal to make any materially false statement or representation in testimony to the unites states congress  and that was not the only false statement that eberhart apparently made to the senators in may  eberhart’s subordinates general arnold and colonel william alan scott presented a slightly revised version of norad’s timeline  they contradicted the timeline for flight  saying that norad was not notified of the hijacking until  three minutes after the aircraft crashed into the south tower  this was despite the fact that when asked by a us senator about “the second hijacked plane somewhere up there” flight  eberhart had previously said “yes sir during that time we were notified” arnold and scott also revealed for the first time that norad was notified about the hijacking of flight  at  am  this was  minutes before that flight allegedly crashed in pennsylvania at  am  obviously interceptor jets could have easily reached and escorted flight  given this revised timeline the fourth and final story from norad was the official account given by the  commission report now supported by norad  in this explanation norad received “no advance notice” on any of the last three hijacked airliners  instead of  minutes of notice on flight  and  minutes notice on flight  and  minutes notice on flight  we were told that norad was not notified about any of them until it was too late  the military was off the hook entirely all the evidence for notifications and response which had constituted the official account for nearly three years had been thrown out the window  in place of these documents and testimonies new explanations were given for why the scrambled aircraft never reached the hijacked airliners these included unbelievable claims of communication failures and misdirection of the scrambled jets as well as the introduction of a neverbefore mentioned “phantom ” scenario the  commission report account was supported two years later by an article in vanity fair   allegedly the author of the article was given privileged access to audio tapes that were not available to the public  although the newly revealed “norad tapes” ostensibly bolstered the commission’s new timeline credible explanations were never given for throwing out the years of testimony and evidence that supported entirely different timelines the changing stories given by norad led to placing more blame for the failed air defenses on the faa  after norad’s  timeline was issued however the faa publicly stated that norad had in fact been informed throughout all the developments that morning  faa official laura brown wrote a memo to the  commission in which she stated that faa shared “realtime information” with norad about “loss of communication with aircraft loss of transponder signals unauthorized changes in course and other actions being taken by all the flights of interest including flight ” faa leadership certainly did fail that morning and there are shocking questions to be answered in that regard  not the least of these questions is why evidence that might have helped was destroyed by an faa official after the attacks  but the multiple stories given by the military indicate that norad was at least as culpable as the faa in the inexplicable lack of air defense and the facts indicate that norad was in the loop earlier than its  timeline suggested meaning that there is no reasonable explanation for why noradcontrolled jets did not intercept most if not all of the planes hijacked on  when questioned by the  commission eberhart confirmed that if norad had been in the loop as the faa said it was his people would have been able “to shoot down all three aircraft — all four aircraft” reasons to suspect eberhart investigation of norad and its commander eberhart is warranted apart from the evidence for lying to congress  additional reasons to focus on eberhart include the following nine facts as commander in chief of the us space command cincspace eberhart was responsible for setting infocon levels  infocon is an alert system that defends against attacks on communications networks within the department of defense dod  just  hours before the  attacks an order was given to lower infocon to its least protective level  setting infocon at a lower level made it easier for people to hack or compromise the dod computer networks including the air defense system as both cincspace and commander in chief of norad cincnorad eberhart was in charge of many of the highly coincidental military exercises ie war games that were going on that morning eberhart did nothing effective in response to the  hijackings despite being present in the military’s teleconference as those hijackings were in progress he did not order the scrambling of jets he did not order an escort for air force one and he did not provide leadership eberhart also failed to implement military control over us airspace until well after the attacks were over  although it was his prerogative to do so eberhart did not implement scatana the process of assuming military control over the us airspace until two hours after the second plane hit the wtc and one hour after the last plane had been destroyed  eberhart later said that he had waited until it finally became “obvious” to him that a coordinated terrorist attack was underway  he told the  commission that although people were telling him to take control of the airspace earlier he didn’t feel that the military could “provide traffic deconfliction like the faa has” in the middle of the  attacks eberhart decided to drive between peterson air force base and norad’s cheyenne mountain operations center cmoc  normally this mile drive takes  minutes but it took eberhart between  minutes and an hour to make the drive that morning  no reason was ever given or requested for why eberhart did not fly directly to cmoc from peterson making use of the cheyenne mountain helicopter port  eberhart made conflicting statements about his reasons for making this trip saying that he stayed for a while at peterson because he “did not want to lose communication”  nevertheless eberhart lost communication at the most important time by leaving at approximately  am est when two of the hijacked planes were still flying wildly offcourse  his reason for doing this was that things had “quieted down” while on his way to the cmoc he was in the us military’s air threat call via cell phone  in this call at  am eberhart “directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations fully armed”  although this might sound like decisive action the command apparently grounded all interceptor jets that had not yet taken off due to the fact that “battle stations” is a grounded status  other military leaders later gave orders to actually scramble the jets  and despite his involvement eberhart portrayed himself as being out of the loop entirely  for example he told the  commission that he had “no knowledge of the circumstances that initiated the scramble” of fighter jets from langley afb and that he had just “recently” been made aware that it happened in march  eberhart failed to explain the multiple changes in the account of  that were given by norad  in fact he seemed to tell his staff to change the norad timeline as much as was needed in order to prevent further questioning about the military’s performance for whatever reasons eberhart also gave out false information about the norad response to others  general richard myers acting cjcs that morning said that eberhart told him there were “several hijack codes in the system”  yet none of the four planes had squawked the hijack code on  and therefore it is not clear how such codes could have been in the system norad failed to cooperate with the  commission  even as late as march  the commission was struggling to get basic documents about  performance from eberhart’s organization  in some cases such as with the afteraction reports that follow all military actions the commission never received the norad documents of all these concerns it is the military exercises that norad was conducting on  that have drawn the most attention from concerned citizens  when questioned about them eberhart claimed that the impact of the  exercises on norad’s response was that they “at most cost us  seconds”  that was clearly not the case norad’s coincidental exercises after several government officials had made incorrect statements about the military’s preparation for hijackings and the use of planes as weapons general myers responded to a pointed question on the subject  he reported that norad had practiced “five exercise hijack events” between november  and october  all of which “included a suicide crash into a high value target”  records since released show that norad practiced approximately  hijack exercise events in the  months leading up to   at least six of these were focused on hijackings located entirely within the unites states which puts to rest the excuse that norad was only looking for threats coming from outside of us borders one of these exercises vigilant guardian in october  practiced interception of an airliner hijacked for a suicide attack against the story united nations building in new york city just a few blocks from the wtc  another air defense exercise called amalgam virgo and practiced just three months before  was accompanied by a planning document that had a picture of osama bin laden on the cover many of the military exercises or war games that were occurring on the day of  were run under the control of cincnorad eberhart  in fact eberhart was in command of the war games that had the greatest impact on the nation’s air defenses  of course he had help norad is divided into several large areas that cover the us and canada one of which is the region of the continental us called conr headed on  by general larry arnold  within conr there are three sectors the  attacks took place in the airspace monitored by conr’s northeast air defense sector neads personnel at neads were therefore primarily responsible for trying to coordinate the norad response to the hijackings  cmoc was also an important facility in the response that should have been effective but was not at neads colonel robert marr was in charge  marr had been in the us air force for over  years until  at which time he spent a few months in saudi arabia as “director of combat operations”  he then left the military to work two years for a private company called phoenix air  coincidentally phoenix air provided aircraft for the amalgam virgo exercises  there is also reason to believe that phoenix air is associated with huffman aviation where the alleged  hijackers had trained  after his stint at phoenix air marr returned to the military as the exercise coordinator at neads and by  had risen to the position of commander of the facility there were several norad exercises planned for   vigilant guardian and vigilant overview both command post exercises cpx and amalgam virgo and amalgam warrior which were field training or ftx exercises  all four of these exercises were cjcs approved and sponsored by cincnorad eberhart  apollo guardian was also running on   this was an exercise conducted by the us space command meaning eberhart was in control of that too ftx exercises are sometimes what are referred to as spades meaning “a track is taken out of radar coverage and then reintroduced as an unknown track”  this exercise feature is interesting given that flight  was lost on radar for a period of time on  and then reappeared in a way that has not yet been explained amalgam virgo  was a modification of twin star a livefly joint faanorad exercise conducted in   this was described by norad exercise design manager ken merchant and major paul goddard the canadian who was norad exercise chief  according to goddard the twin star plan was to have interceptor jets scramble and escort a hijacked airliner  during that exercise “the fighters never got off on the appropriate heading and it took them forever to catch up” it is interesting to consider that amalgam virgo  which was said to be only in the planning stages might actually have been in play on   one reason to consider this is that on  the fighters “never got off on the appropriate heading and it took them forever to catch up”  another reason is that  commissioner richard benveniste showed considerable interest in amalgam virgo  as did the  commission staff in its request for documents  according to benveniste this was a case in which “norad had already in the works plans to simulate in an exercise a simultaneous hijacking of two planes in the united states”  the plan for amalgam virgo  was therefore similar to the  attacks with multiple simultaneous hijackings another largescale exercise being conducted on  was global guardian a joint nuclear war simulation run by the us strategic command stratcom in conjunction with norad  this was essentially a practice for armageddon that involved live nuclear bombs and at least three airborne command and control airliners called ebs  the eb that was seen circling the white house during the  attacks might have been part of this exercise the  commission did not mention most of these exercises in its report  to the contrary the report mentioned only vigilant guardian and then only one time in a deceptively stated footnote that said “on  norad was scheduled to conduct a military exercise vigilant guardian which postulated a bomber attack from the soviet union”  this statement is false in several ways not the least of which is that norad was scheduled to conduct at least five exercises on   and vigilant guardian was not simply an exercise involving one bomber from the former soviet union vigilant guardian vg had been in play for several days as of   on september  it included a scenario in which terrorists hijacked an airliner and planned to attack new york city  the exercise presented a number of other scenarios based around airliner hijackings and in one of these the fictitious terrorists threatened to “rain terror from the skies” according to the vg planning documents the  exercise was to be conducted “sim over live” meaning the simulated hijackings were to be inserted into the live air control system  this was repeated in the instructions – “ensure all tracks of interest sim or live are input on the live chart”  furthermore the vg plan was that “all expansions will be real world”  although frequently misunderstood the term “real world” does not refer to an actual hijacking it refers to the use of real aircraft in livefly exercises due to these confusing circumstances neads staff confused the actual hijackings on  with the exercises   as researcher matthew everett explained — “what is remarkable… is that at a time when it should have been obvious to them that the us was in the middle of a major terrorist attack these key personnel at neads were uncertain whether what was happening was real or simulated”  the confusion caused much more than a “ second” problem as eberhart suggested because neads personnel thought the exercises were continuing well after the attacks on  vg was scheduled to include a simulated hijacking at  am within an hour of when flight  struck the wtc  when they first learned that flight  was hijacked neads staff noted that the “exercise” appeared to be starting an hour early that morning  the evidence indicates that everyone at neads including colonel marr thought the actual hijackings were exercises  they even joked about it  that might have been due to the vg plan stating that the neads building where colonel marr and company were located was a planned “exercise play area” and everyone there knowingly or not was “subject to exercise play” neads radar scopes were displaying simulated information at least until the time of the pentagon attack  the same problem was going on at cmoc another exercise play area with radar screens showing false tracks as late as  am  in fact personnel at cmoc called neads in an attempt to stop the exercise inputs  because those inputs did not stop it appeared that someone wanted the neads and cmoc radar scopes to continue showing false information until after the four planes had been destroyed ken merchant added that the national military command center nmcc located at the pentagon regularly participated in norad exercises by interjecting emergency action messages eams  on  the performance of the nmcc which plays a critical role in establishing the military chain of command and communicating orders was remarkably poor  officers there lacked any sense of urgency and were completely ineffective with regard to communications the disruptive effect of the ongoing norad exercises that morning continued until after all the hijacked planes had crashed  one military newspaper said vg continued until  minutes after attacks  global guardian was “formally terminated” at  am but certain actions taken after that time including that cmoc blast doors were closed a needless action in terms of hijacked airliners suggested that the exercise continued investigating eberhart investigation of ralph eberhart and his subordinates would almost certainly reveal more of what the public needs to know whether eberhart or others were part of a conspiracy to attack the united states is not the only reason  the main purpose would be to understand how such an inexplicable failure to follow the longstanding and most critical procedures of the us defense system could be followed by a string of lies about that inexplicable failure eberhart was among the liars and he was in charge of norad at the time  was he lying to make himself and his organization look bad as the  commission suggests  or is he lying now along with the  commission in order to remove norad’s responsibility and eliminate questioning about  a year after  eberhart was rewarded for his performance by being placed in charge of the new northcom organization he has more recently been praised and honored for his great work on   called a “ hero” despite having been a disastrous failure on that day he was honored by having the new northcom headquarters at peterson afb named after him there is an intangible benefit to consider as well  like a number of people who should be investigated for  eberhart was a veteran of the only war in which the united states was defeated  he began his military career as a forward air controller stationed out of pleiku air base in south vietnam coincidentally benedict sliney who was in charge of faa operations on  was an air traffic controller stationed in pleiku at about the same time  fighting in related operations was michael canavan the faa’s missing hijack coordinator on  who was in the th special forces group sfg  also in the th sfg were brian michael jenkins who as deputy chairman of kroll designed the wtc security systems and cjcs hugh shelton who was yet another highlevel leader missing on   shelton’s temporary replacement that morning richard myers was a combat pilot in vietnam along with donald rumsfeld and dick cheney who were highlevel leaders in the nixon administration at the time all these men were undoubtedly devastated by the defeat in vietnam  cheney and rumsfeld experienced the only other significant defeat of their careers when president ford lost the  election a few years later  other people who played critical roles on  and also worked under the ford administration included l paul bremer frank carlucci rudy giuliani and dod employees richard clarke paul wolfowitz and richard armitage the defeats in vietnam and the  presidential election made their mark on these men  years later the attacks of  brought all of them a late chance for redemption and victory  and it made them all heroes eberhart benefited from the  attacks in more tangible ways as well  he continued on as head of norad and northcom through   after that he went on to become the chairman for more than half a dozen stock or bond equity funds and a board director for a similar number of companies profiting from increased military expenditures oil and gas services and “homeland security” the bottom line is that norad officials working for ralph eberhart covered up the facts about the lack of air defense on  by lying to the american people and by failure to cooperate with the  investigations  for those reasons alone eberhart’s performance that day and the related statements should be thoroughly investigated  considering the nine facts presented above about eberhart’s activities on  and that eberhart appears to have violated us law by lying to congress that investigation should be performed with the utmost assertiveness including formal charges and the use of subpoenas  nicholas levis senator dayton norad lied about

failures or were they failures reply grey says november   at  pm exactly he didn’t fail in his mission on september th  it was resounding success for him and his band of fucking traitors we know most of the key players who attacked our country on  yet none of them have been brought to justice or have even been publically accused of taking part in the largest attack on american soil since pearl harbor guess what none of these men will ever be brought to justice we’re witnessing the purposeful destruction of our country the only hope we have is enough americans wake up and force the criminals

allofasudden the second one was only because the prior one wasn’t appearing i finally became fed up with the automatic wordpress login not working for my reply to xxxanonxxx so went to wp to do the login there and now my reattempts at trying to get the reply posted finally worked only it also shows two of the multiple attempts rather than only showing one peculiar is that i replied to other comments afterwards and those replies were immediately posted it’s only the reply to xxxanonxxx that was always being unposted perhaps it has something to do with the inclusion of youtube links for that’s about the only difference that i think to see or maybe that andor the links having initially begun with the http and https prefixes in the reply to xxxanonxxx it seems to be for either or both of these reasons that there was a posting problem submission seemed to work for there were no error messages or warnings of any sort only the reply wasn’t effectively posted if wp is the problem then it should produce a message saying what the problem is and wp seems to be what this blog depends on peculiar also is that i’m presently logged in at wp and when i click the “posting comment…” button beneath this comment box and the fields for specifying email address and username i nevertheless get another wp login prompt pingback the next logocal step in the  conspiracy theory  page   us message board  political discussion forum mike corbeil says march   at  pm excellentfantastique article and i’ll inform people about it when appropriate topicwise i spend enough time on the topic of  so there’ll be occasions to inform people about this article often enough it’d be great to have this in video format and uploaded at youtube but we can always refer people to articles when posting comments there so i’ll be doing this it’s very clear that eberhart is guilty of very high crimes and very possibly treason him and plenty of others and i guess that we can say that this article is very complementary with or for your part article “demolition access …” for which there’s a copy at reviewcom which includes a decent or good introduction by don paul i’ve been recommending that article ever since reading it a few years ago so now there’ll be this additional piece about eberhart just learned about your website this morning from the following index httpreviewcomarticlesryanindexhtml reply pingback couple of articles about   and by kevin ryan  mike corbeils blog steve says march   at  am i think that one of the important things to think about here is the possibility that united flight  was shot down by the air force and then subsequently covered up no i’m not saying it was a conspiracy by bush or an inside job what i am saying is that to shoot down a commercial airliner on its way to washington dc would be very hard to explain to the american public a true first it’s important to look at the actions and timelines of general montague winfield donald rumsfeld general richard myers and general eberhart – especially between the time of  and  am also look at the neads timeline and taped conversations there are many areas where the conversations are not recorded or noted in the official transcript especially between  and  am i’m sure that general eberhart made plenty of mistakes for which he is covering up however i also believe that there’s a plausible reason for why the norad timeline for united  was not initially released to the public as it did with the other planes just my thoughts steve reply mike corbeil says april   at  am regarding the shootdown of ua which actually happened and this is why the plane crashed into a pennsylvania rural field i recommend searching reviewcom researchwtcnet and wtcnet they’re all originally from or edited by jim hoffman who i believe to continue to edit them while it also seems that other people contribute today from what i’ve gathered over the past few months reviewcom seems to be the one least updated but i always refer to it anyway along with the other two these are good websites and they might need a little updating here and there but given all of the content provided we can understand that it isn’t easy to perform all revisions in fastaslightning speed i’m not sure which has the most recent updates and additions but it seems to be either wtcnet or researchwtcnet search the three about ua  and you’ll learn that a sufficient number of local people witnessed the shootdown plane plus the fact that there were parts of the plane spread over an unusually large area and a little more reply mike corbeil says march   at  am a little correction for my first comment about eberhart forget the “very possibly” part he isn’t very possibly treasonous he simply is we clearly don’t need to have any doubt about this it’s how i felt what i thougt when adding “very possibly” but that’s just “politically correct” nonsense and i should’t have added those words the man clearly is treachorous if i’m now mistaken then i’m open to “enlightenment” but it’ll surely be very difficult for anyone to be able to convince me that he isn’t a traitor regardless of his intentions if he didnt mean to be traitor that is for he was either way there’s nothing new about this but it’s not a fact that we should become comfortble with either reply mikecorbeil says april   at  pm i just received a notice about steve’s post seconds ago even if i posted since his comment having posted on march th while he posted on march th anyway i find some of what he says a little comical quote “i think that one of the important things to think about here is the possibility that united flight  was shot down by the air force and then subsequently covered up no i’m not saying it was a conspiracy by bush or an inside job” of course not a coverup by washington wouldn’t be an inside job israel made the us do this after having drugged washington to the point that it had no clue of what was going on while i perceive the israeli government as a real enemy of the usa i nevertheless don’t believe the abovestated explanation of course the coverup was an inside job and of course ua  was shot down by the us military how more inside do we want to get and no keep washington out of my bed svp steve added quote “what i am saying is that to shoot down a commercial airliner on its way to washington dc would be very hard to explain to the american public” ha ha ha ha steve is trying to be funny but assuming he’s not then all i can say is no kidding but the least that could be done is to break the news only after people have had their meals like a couple of hours after to make sure that there’s time for full digestion of the food otherwise barf or “vomiture” will become the new name of the usa i’ll recommend reviewcom researchwtcnet historycommonsorg fe visibilitycom apparently is a good resource but i haven’t personally used it only having paid a few very short visits over many years but i learned about it from the recommended links at review or research yet i never came across information like kevin ryan provided with this article about treachorous general eberhart i’ve believed in “inside job” for many years but this piece about eberhart certainly rocked me reply teeth whitening paint says april   at  pm very descriptive post i liked that bit will there be a part  reply mike corbeil says april   at  am i’m wondering which post you’re referring to if you mean kevin ryan’s article then i’d say “article” rather than post for while the article was posted the same is also true of reader comments so you could be referring to either and only you know for sure or with certainty it’s always better to be clear about what we mean when posting online or in any communication for that matter if you’re meaning kevin’s article then your comment would be fine as it is for a pm but try to not forget that it’s a different matter when posting in comments sections that any visitor can read and others have already commented if yours was the first comment then it would be okay but there’re plenty of comments before yours i’m not a moderator of this website’s comments section or any other part of the website but given that it’s kevin ryan’s website and the important contribution that he’s been providing to  truth i think all users should contribute to making this website highly qualitative with the comments that’re added part of being qualitative is being clear it helps to preclude questions that ideally would be unnecessary for the information or answers are already in place or provided “art of communication” an important part is being clear rather than ambiguous no offence intended your comment just leaves me confused about what you’re referring to reply christian says may   at  pm former intelligence officials have hypothesize’d that if  was a cover up you would needs wtc security clearencr and norad officials “on the inside” this for the controlled demo explosives to be put into towers as well as building  which honestly fell in same way as twin towers ie at extremely close to free fall speed into its own footprint as well as to confuse and stall fighter jets from being in position its sobering to learn who had been given wtc security “big wig” status and to see and hear accounts of blasts going on inside towers and then buildings falling like a control’d demo the cia by the way has stop’d several terrorist threats but did u know they trained and financed alot of these radical islamists to the point of then setting them up and taking the credit for “stopping them” you should also reasonably conclude that if  was lead by rogue forces within certain intelligence and military circles w a cpl careful placed govt officials likely w some amount of compartmentalize knowledge that the truth can not be known to the public bc the threat of upheaval and societal breakdown and riots would be destabalizing beyond current abilities to confidently contain reply mikecorbeil says may   at  pm wtc  wasn’t destroyed in the same way look carefully at videos of the destruction of towers  and  and then  there’re serious differences all  were evidently demolition jobs that certainly no outside organization could’ve carried out or been responsible for but the destruction differed with no   fell right into its own footprint whereas the tops of  and  or certainly one of those two anyway exploded outward with great force and there were less but nonetheless other outward explosions the first few seconds with  also was at very near perfect freefall speed but this wasn’t the case with  and  all  were demolition jobs but there were marked differences that’re very observable when carefully watching the videos plenty that’ve been uploaded by aetruth and david chandler channels at youtube he did this as a member or certainly associate of aetruth and his channel used to be davidchandler or something like that wtc security for “wtc security clearencr” you evidently mean wtc security management my guess is that some of them had to be somewhat included in the “inside loop” of information but not everyone in these circles is told everything it’s on a “need to know” basis only and very strictly some people refer to it usually in other contexts as compartementalization a “hit man” fe doesn’t need to know more than he or she needs to know to carry out a hit a security manager would just need to be told by superior authorities that heshe has to allow bla bla whatever to happen and that there’s nothing to worry about higherups supposedly having good conscience and knowing what they’re doing that’s if the security manager is someone who’s of good conscience if they’re not then they can be told a little more though not everything not everyone in a criminal organization if any organization at all is equally informedknowledgeable each participant learns what heshe has to know in order to be able to carry out the work that heshe is paid for but they don’t need to have greater knowledge in order for the leadership to be able to carry out all of its planning etc regarding wtc security reviewcom or researchwtcnet and i think it’s a piece by jim hoffman presents an argument that i find interesting this is in a critique of scott forbes’ account a guy who apparently is like almost entirely unknown though not entirely and his story apparently hasn’t been corroborated the following are some example articles “unlikely ‘the south tower was powered down before the attack” last modified on  jan  httpreviewcomerrorswtcforbeshtml excerpts  it makes no sense that the perpetrators would do something so obvious as powering down half of a tower so shortly before the attack … …  powering down for cabling upgrades is laughable as a cover story … cabling upgrades for data bandwidth do not require interrupting ac power at all …  contrary to the email’s assertion security cameras are designed to use independent uninterruptible power supplies … end of excerpts i still haven’t heard anyone speak about this supposed forbes account in a way that can cause me to doubt that the above reviewcom page is wrong everything isn’t “hunkydory ok” about security at the wtc on and over the days weeks months preceding  but what scott forbes purportedly said is very questionable and i don’t know of anyone who’s actually spoken with him something was wrongly done with security at the wtc but what forbes supposedly said and which apparently was communicated through others is very questionable as far as i know he’s like a ghost and even less verifiable than that httpresearchwtcnettalksmysteriespowerdownhtml sibel edmonds said earlier this year that she only listens to two people about the  attacks scott forbes and i believe the other is jon gold while i think gold has said some acceptable things without agreeing with him  though nevertheless enough the forbes account is very or else totally uncorroborated and would definitely need to be corroborated what gold has said from what little i read and heard anyway raised some questions for me but he wasn’t speaking as a witness forbes’s account is treated like a witness or eyewitness one and this requires corroboration there’re no others when there should normally be many people who witnessed the same thing we only have people who support and refer to what he purportedly said nothing more supposedly isn’t good enough real corroboration is essential if what he purportedly said is to be seriously believed but i guess that sibel edmonds can be forgiven about this flaw in her choices after all she certainly isn’t a technologist some elementary questions   how could forbes who was supposedly working on the it system for his employer on floor no x in one of the two wtc towers hit by a plane have known that power was totally cut off from the th floor to the top did he leave his job or assignment to go inspect what the power situation was on upper and lower floors he was purportedly there to do emergency work for his employer not the rest of the tower which had somewhere around or a little over  floors  how would he know that all doors normally locked by security were unlocked how many did he check he was there for the weekend for emergency it work for his employer so why did he go around checking doors for all or many of the other floors when his employer occupied only  or  floors or parts of them  who told him that power was disabled from floor  upward and that all normally secured doors were unlocked due to powerdown  why has this supposed scott forbes not been proven to be a real person as far as i know this still hasn’t been done after nearly a decade why hasn’t he come forward  if he has come forward and proven his identity that he worked at the wtc the weekend preceding  etc then why is the “ community” like totally silent about this kevin ryan wrote a part article and reviewcom provides an apparently full copy including an introduction by don paul who i’ll let others look up all  parts are worth reading and it’s important information there’s also a video that presents some overview of what’s said in the part piece i already included this in a prior comment here for this page but will repeat it “demolition access to the wtc towers” by kevin ryan  reviewcomarticlesryandemolitionaccessdonpaulhtml a complmentary video for the part article and which i also find to be quite interesting is the following minute one “ suspects – explosive connections updated fixed and revised” uploaded by warcrime on  oct  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvffspkoreey he has an older  video on the same topic and that’s titled while saying “part  of ” i found a second part but no more the two parts provide about min for runtime and perhaps they’re important to listen to when listening the above one of only min the following link is for part  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvgrybkfkmfym the same user has the following related video “marvin bush stratesec and  the straight facts” uploaded on  dec  min httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvtpdkajto these  videos are based on kevin ryan’s writings and they definitely inform readers and listeners to the fact that there were serious problems with security but none say what forbes purportedly claimed reply raspberry ketones says june   at  am there is certainly a lot to find out about this topic i love all the points you have made reply httpsemfronteirascomjobokeyframeb says june   at  pm admiring the persistence you put into your blog and detailed information you present it’s good to come across a blog every once in a while that isn’t the same outdated rehashed material fantastic read i’ve bookmarked your site and i’m adding your rss feeds to my google account reply lynette says june   at  am hi there i could have sworn i’ve been to this blog before but after browsing through a few of the articles i realized it’s new to me nonetheless i’m certainly happy i found it and i’ll be bookmarking it and checking back regularly reply us fast cash credit says july   at  am oh my goodness awesome article dude thank you so much however i am having difficulties with your rss i don’t know why i am unable to subscribe to it is there anybody else getting similar rss problems anybody who knows the answer will you kindly respond thanks reply mikecorbeil says july   at  am for other readers skip this comment unless having problems with subscribing to the rss feed for that’s all this post is about this ideally would be a qa placed in a different comments section perhaps in the about page for this blog or website but i have no way to move this there while leaving your post here and the first part of your comment is specifically about the … like you said “awesome article” of this page what problem is it you’re having with rss here i was able to easily subscribe using the “entries rss” link in the section of meta links located on the righthandside of a web page here if i click on it now which i did after reading your question and then also tried the “comments rss” link then this immediately causes popup prompts for adding these as “live bookmark” i didn’t know what lb was but said ok maybe a month ago and it worked now i get the prompt but i cancel them due to already being subscribed i’m using firefox which is always kept to the most recent official release if you’re also using ffx and the current or a recent release rather than one many years old as some people seem to do fe then you should be getting the popup prompt if clicking on the two rss subscription links from this page then i respectively get the two following urls httpsdigwithinnetfeed httpsdigwithinnetcommentsfeed clicking on the same what seem to be the same anyway links from the home page of this website the url doesn’t change it remains httpdigwithinnet for both rss links i just performed these tests and if i check properties for the feed or lb added around a month ago then it’s httpsdigwithinnetfeed it’s correctly working if clicking on the rss links don’t work for you for getting the popup prompt to add a lb then try again by copying pasting and loading the feed urls specified above in a separate tab say if that also doesn’t work then there perhaps is a problem that’s due to your web browser in that case try inquiring with user support for the browser firefox or mozilla browser users should check both mozillaorg as well as mozillazineorg misie users can simply do a web search of microsoftcom for this will include technet and social sections mozilla and mozillazine need to be separately searched the ‘zine one isn’t by mozilla it’s by mozilla product users and provides a forum as well as a knowledge base reply awright says august   at  pm the idea that norad could have affected the events of  is largely spurious there was nothing that could have or should have been done to stop aa  and no plausible way the crash of ua could have been stopped either with aa given better coordination that might have been intercepted at least but even then positively identifying it and getting an order to do something about it would have been difficult with ua  it would in all likelihood have been intercepted if it hadn’t been crashed since it is unlikely norad could have done little to prevent what happened there would be no requirement to hamper them in preventing it those trying to help did their best in the circumstances reply mikecorbeil says september   at  pm awright evidently is very wrong and a clear example of this is wherein heshe wrote quote “with ua  it would in all likelihood have been intercepted if it hadn’t been crashed” ua  was intercepted it was shot down see jim hoffman’s websites researchwtcnet and reviewcom all a person needs to do is to either work their way through the websites’ menus or use fe google with the search terms of “flight ” and “ua ” for separate searches “ua ” returns only  link and it may or possibly may not be included in the links returned for “flight ” so i’d recommend both searches the main page is entitled “flight ” and i’ll briefly cite from it quote shootdown according to the official story flight  crashed by flying into the ground near somerset pennsylvania as a result of a struggle between passengers and the hijackers however eyewitness reports and widely scattered debris belie this account … end quote emphasis is to be placed on “eyewitness reports and widely scattered debris belie” the official “story” a person who doesn’t speak other than the official “story” about ua  is surely not someone to consider believing about the other  attack flights either not today not after all of these many years reply

another drill baby drill  the sandy monocle waitew says may   at  pm a far better case can be made against neads commander col robert marr with specific obstruction to our air defenses that we can prove one by one why the silence from the truth movement reply mikecorbeil says june   at  am we can use the name to do some web searches but you should provide links to the sources you used not necessarily everyone who’s published about col marr with respect to  will say the same things some may say the same thing but all while some of theyse may say little and others say more good writers or speakers provide reference notes for the sources used take the following article fe httpreviewcomarticlesgaffneymysteryplanehtml quote the  mystery plane part ii mark h gaffney part  in a series see part i may   … yet incredibly the  commission report barely mentions the issue it appears that instead of doing its job ie digging for the truth the commission meekly accepted the military’s various explanations without a word of protest general mckinley for example … there was also the lame excuse about antiquated radar equipment … according to scoggins neads could see everything the faa saw and more neads’ failure to locate flight  on radar had the serious consequence of slowing down the military’s response because col robert marr neads commander was reluctant to scramble his otis fighters without a target was this the intended outcome … end quote doing a web search of researchwtcnet turns up links but it appears to be a copies of some  report doing a web search of bloggercom however turns up plenty more nonetheless you should provide source references who wants to spend a day or two trying to find the material that you should be able to include specific references for not me reply joseph p bell says october   at  pm what a strange armed services committee and  commission  none of them seem to be aware that the norad tapes  show general nasypany in charge of planes chasing unseen targets  nara has no specific documents about nasypany  nasty   scoggins was the only one in contact with neads  especially the misinformation about flight  there is  are no contacts between the faa  except for flight   on the other  planes  no one can see or hear any contacts between either agency  cleveland center focused on   and  all passengers disembarked and never seen again  is anyone familiar with a del favaro  from nashville  flying over the wtc on   saw the flames from the tower  at the airport where they landed  they were not allowed to go into manhattan  never

admiral  deborah loewer  was with bush at the “little goat “reading  she was in charge of situation room she was made admiral  reply joseph p bell says october   at  pm my apologies  statements made by  staff stating the faa did this or that  are made up by zelikow and his pupils  staff dedicated to “lying “  john farmer was the only dissenting vote  john azzarello   they were told by marcus and zelikow  they could not go back and interview neads in ny  rome   the six charges had not been filed yet  reply paulydeathwish says june   at  am tremendous article so welldone i was unfamiliar with

february   accountability evidence and research air defense failures originally published at consensus  on  introduction norad is the uscanadian military agency responsible for defending north american airspace its traditional operating procedures – according to which planes are to be intercepted when they deviate from their courses turn off their transponders or permanently lose radio contact – were not followed on  as the commanderinchief of norad on  general ralph e “ed” eberhart was ultimately responsible for all of norad’s failures on  – most importantly the failure to intercept hijacked airliners before they could strike the twin towers and the pentagon the fourth airliner ua  which was reportedly headed towards the nation’s capital may have been shot down by norad but norad has denied this accordingly the official story about  is that norad was fourforfour in failing to intercept hijacked airliners that day nevertheless in spite of norad’s disastrous failures under general eberhart’s leadership he was never held accountable or even criticized indeed he was promoted shortly after  and later called a “ hero” unlike others such as gen richard myers and gen henry shelton eberhart has not written an account of his actions on  likewise he was seldom discussed by the  commission accordingly we do not know much about his actions that day but enough has been said and reported by officials and the media to add up to an official story about his actions the official account “on the morning of  general eberhart was in his office at headquarters—roughly  minutes away from cheyenne mountain where the operations center is located” “eberhart received a call at  am mdt mountain daylight time or  am est sic edt from cmoc’s cheyenne mountain operation center’s command director cd that informed him of the ongoing circumstance of a suspected hijacking on the east coast he was told that this was a nonexercise he went to his office and saw the cnn broadcast of the world trade center explosion” it seemed to eberhart that there was “great confusion in the system” at this time this was also stated by canadian lt gen rick findley the battle staff director at cheyenne mountain operations center who later told the  commission that following the second attack on the twin towers there was “confusion as to how many and which aircraft were hijacked” when eberhart learned about the second wtc attack it became obvious to him that “an ongoing and coordinated terrorist attack” was underway eberhart tried to contact chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general henry shelton but could not because shelton was on a plane to europe to attend a nato meeting eberhart then contacted the acting chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen richard myers who was on capitol hill meeting with senator max cleland eberhart called myers sometime between  and  am hence before the report of the pentagon attack which took place at approximately  am eberhart updated myers about the crisis telling him that the twin towers had been hit that norad would be launching fighter jets in response and that he was working with the faa to get all nonmilitary planes in the united states grounded according to myers eberhart told him that there were “several hijack codes in the system” which meant said myers “that the transponders in the aircraft were talking to the ground and they’re saying    we’re being hijacked” eberhart next said that he was going to remain at building  of peterson air force base – the headquarters of the us air force space command of which eberhartwas also the commander – because “he did not want to lose communication” however he then decided to drive to norad’s cheyenne mountain operations center leaving at “approximately ” edt or  mdt which would have been shortly after his conversation with myers as to why eberhart took this trip during the crisis he explained that things had “quieted down” and the operations center “had communications capabilities not available at peterson” although according to the  commission making the mile drive normally takes “roughly  minutes” it took eberhart  minutes as a washington post story reported later the trip “can be timeconsuming if traffic is bad” during this period it was later reported eberhart “couldn’t receive telephone calls as senior officials weighed how to respond” or at least could not hold them he “lost a cell phone call with vice president dick cheney” at  am eberhart during the pentagon’s air threat conference call ordered “all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations fully armed” the  commission asked eberhart why he after realizing that there was an organized attack against the country did not implement the plan called scatana security control of air traffic and air navigation which would clear the sky of all nonmilitary planes so that the military would have complete control of the us airspace eberhart explained that with the radars it had norad would not have been able to “control the airspace that day” so if scatana had been implemented suddenly even more problems would have developed in response to those within norad who had advised him to implement it immediately eberhart said “i will execute scatana once you have a modified scatana that    doesn’t cause a bad situation to become worse” two hours after the second plane hit the wtc eberhart was able to execute the modified scatana the best evidence an examination of the evidence shows that eberhart rather than being considered a “ hero” may well be the opposite this evidence can be divided into two categories  eberhart made several contradictory and implausible statements  eberhart also caused delays by virtue of his actions and omissions  eberhart made several contradictory and implausible statements the official story about eberhart contains the following elements discussed in the order they appeared in the summary above eberhart said that he first tried to contact gen shelton finding that he was on the way to europe however given that shelton’s trip had been planned for some time the claim that eberhart did not know when his immediate superior the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff would be absentis not credible eberhart said that he called general myers while the latter was on capitol hill – which as shown in the  consensus point about myers was false although eberhart reported that the hijacked airliners having used the hijack code were talking to the ground the failure of all eight pilots to squawk the hijack code is one of the main problems with the official account although eberhart justified driving to the operations center by saying that things had “quieted down” two hijacked airliners were still in the air which his statements about several hijack codes implies that he believed if he had a good reason to get to the operations center he could have taken the quick helicopter trip rather than wasting  minutes or longer driving the distance although eberhart claimed that he was unable to communicate by cell phone during the trip he at  am  mountain reportedly ordered – during an air threat conference call – interceptor pilots to get to their battle stations although “battle stations” sounds like an effective action it actually means that pilots wait in their jets with the engines off so they were not ready to scramble immediately eberhart’s claim that he could not implement scatana immediately without making a bad situation worse is not credible given that scatana was a procedure set up for emergencies and the modified scatana would have surely been already worked out especially given the fact that norad was doing exercises at the time including a plane crashing into a manhattan skyscraper also the norad officers who were urging eberhart to order scatana evidently saw no problem with doing so accordingly the official account about eberhart contains inaccuracies extraordinary claims and actions and omissions through which the interception of the hijacked airliners would have been delayed  eberhart caused delays through further actions and omissions there were additional irregularities regarding eberhart’s actions omissions and statements it is standard operating procedure for norad to intercept a flight if it has lost radio contact turned off its transponder and gone off course this was true of all four  flights and yet norad under eberhart did not intercept any of them as to why norad failed to intercept it gave out a timeline in  claiming norad knew about the hijackings and tried to intercept the airliners but could never get there in time norad told this story from  until  but then in the  commission report it gave a completely different account according to which  the faa failed to alert norad about american  until it was too late for jets to reach it and  the faa failed to tell norad about all three of the other flights until after they had crashed regarding american  which reportedly hit the pentagon eberhart and the  commission said that “neads never received notice that american  was hijacked” but if that were true why did eberhart about six weeks after the attacks tell the us senate that norad had scrambled jets at  am after being notified that hijacked american  was coming towards washington adding that this was a “documented notification” did the  timeline mean that eberhart’s  statement to the senate was a lie or did it mean that the faa was lying when it emphatically said that it had shared “realtime information” with norad and the pentagon about “all the flights of interest including flight ” as to why the new story may have emerged the  research community had shown that norad’s first timeline did not excuse norad because there would have been time to intercept the airliners before the twin towers and the pentagon were hit in june  while the  commission report was being prepared eberhart said that this view was correct – that if neads had been told about the flights when the faa claimed his people would have been able to shoot down “shoot down all three of them — all four aircraft” when eberhart was interviewed by the  commission in march  he said he had “no knowledge of the circumstancesic that initiated the scramble” of fighter jets at  am from langley having learned that neads had scrambled those fighters in response to a false report – that american  which had hit wtc  was still airborne and heading toward washington dc – eberhart said that he had learned about this false report only “recently” it seems incredible that the head of norad would have been ignorant about which fighters had been scrambled until two and a half years following the attacks eberhart had the responsibility of setting the alert levels of the infocon which defends against attacks on the pentagon’s communications networks just  hours before the attacks infocon was reduced to its least protective level and then not raised until after the second wtc attack eberhart was also in charge of many of norad’s military exercises “war games” that occurred on  such as vigilant guardian which had a scenario in which terrorists hijacked an airliner with the aim of attacking new york city the exercise was conducted “sim over live” meaning the simulated hijackings were to be inserted into the live air traffic control system as a result neads personnel for some time were uncertain whether the radar tracks were real or simulatedaccording to eberhart’s own testimony he realized after the second wtc attack hence shortly after  am that a “coordinated terrorist attack” was underway eberhart was the person with the primary responsibility to protect canada and the us from attack and yet he allowed the war games to continue until after  ammoreover radar personnel at cheyenne asked neads to “get rid of this goddamn sim” according to a  commission interview with canadian lt gen rick findley who was norad’s battle staff director at cheyenne mountain operations center on the morning of september  there was following the second attack “confusion as to how many and which aircraft were hijacked” nevertheless the sim remained until after the time of the pentagon attack at  am when asked about the impact of the military exercises by the  commission eberhart falsely claimed that they had “at most cost us  seconds” researcher and reporter michael kane of global free press who was on the scene at a  commission hearing reported “after general eberhart’s sworn testimony i asked him who was in charge of coordinating the multiple war games running on  he replied ‘no comment’” however lt col dawne deskins from the north east air defense sector neads told the commission “exercises that are designed on the norad level are created at planning conferences norad planning exercises are mostly held at peterson” which is where general eberhart was in charge conclusion eberhart made several statements that were clearly false and others that were at least highly implausible including that he decided it would be all right to drive to the operations center because things had “quieted down” that the airliner pilots had squawked the hijack code that he could not use his cell phone during his drive to the operations center that the military exercises would have delayed neads no more than  seconds that he had only recently learned that the  am scramble was based on a false report about american  that he called general myers while the latter was on capitol hill eberhart also caused delays through his actions and omissions by turning infocon down to the least protective level by taking  minutes or longer to drive to the operations center with a cell phone that reportedly did not work which meant that eberhart – like bush cheney rumsfeld myers shelton and winfield – was reportedly incommunicado during the attacks by ordering interceptor pilots to “battle stations” which meant that the pilots wait in their jets with the engines off so they were not ready to scramble immediately by delaying to implement scatana until after the attacks were over by arranging multiple military exercises for  with at least one of them being “sim over live” then not ordering removal of these confusing “sims” until after the pentagon attack finally in agreeing with the  commission’s statement that norad’s  timeline was false eberhart implied that the military under his control had given a false account in short eberhart did nothing effective in response to the  hijackings – despite being present in the military’s teleconference as those hijackings were in progress – except to delay responses considerable evidence points to eberhart as having been derelict in his duty a formal investigation should be launched to see if there is any other conclusion that could be reached  previous point next point  references for point mc  gerry j gilmore “eberhart tabbed to head us northern

version of this video and click here for the  suspects playlist transcript according to the official story of september   four hijacked airliners flew wildly off course over the most sensitive airspace in the united states for  minutes without being intercepted by a single fighter jet as commanderinchief of the north american aerospace defense command on  general ralph eberhart was in charge of the largest failure to defend north american airspace in history rather than accepting blame for his command’s complete lack of response that morning however or even expressing regret about what had occurred general eberhart instead spent the rest of his career attempting to pin the blame for this failure squarely on the faa gen eberhart you’ve read a lot over the last two and a half years about what norad did and did not do that morning and should have done in the years and months leading up to that attack ground truth is that norad was charged to support the faa in the event of a hijacking our role was to respond to the request from faa to get airborne fly shadow the hijacked airplane say whether the hijacked airplane was following the instructions of the air traffic controller of faa and in a terrible situation that that plane crashed or that airplane exploded in midair document that tragedy source homeland defense in the global war on terrorism although eberhart’s version of events was cemented into place as the official story of  propounded by the  commission they are in fact selfserving lies in eberhart’s version of events norad is completely subordinate to the faa in reality however norad is specifically tasked with dealing with such events itself not waiting passively for faa orders norad’s own regulations for dealing with hijacked jets specifically state that “faa authorization for interceptor operations is not used for intercept and airborne surveillance of hijacked aircraft within the continental united states” these standard operating procedures were not merely theoretical or some obscure regulation that would have been unfamiliar to the fourstar general in charge of defending american airspace in the year  alone norad scrambled fighters in response to “unknowns”–pilots who didn’t file or diverted from flight plans or used the wrong frequency– times perhaps even more remarkable however is that eberhart and norad offered not one not two not three but four separate timelines of their complete lack of response that morning the first offered by chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard myers just two days after the attacks during his confirmation hearings in the senate claimed that not a single fighter was scrambled to intercept any of the airliners until after the incident at the pentagon one week later norad released a partial timeline that indicated they had in fact received advance notification about three of the planes with as much as  minutes warning more than enough time for the planes to have been intercepted a third story emerged in may  this time norad was only contacted about flight  at   minutes after it crashed into the south tower the official story found in the  commission’s final report was that norad received no advance notice of any of the flights eberhart and the military were completely exonerated however eberhart had testified in october  that norad had been notified about flight  at  am the  commission determined that this was a lie regardless of the truth or untruth of any of these accounts the simple fact is that according to the  commission itself eberhart had lied to congress which is in fact a crime by the  commission’s own account eberhart should have been tried but eberhart’s lies do not end there gen eberhart many people will talk about that they knew that there was going to be an attack they knew that people were going to take over an aircraft and fly it into a building i can tell you that there was no credible intelligence at that time to go build a defense against that type of attack tragically we were wrong we were wrong source homeland defense in the global war on terrorism once again eberhart’s depiction of events is a selfserving and easily demonstrable lie not only had norad envisioned such a scenario they had been training for it extensively in the years leading up to  between october  and september  norad had conducted  exercise events involving hijackings at least five of those hijack scenarios involved “a suicide crash into a highvalue target” furthermore at least six of the exercises took place completely within american airspace putting to rest the oftheard excuse that norad wasn’t prepared for threats from within the us another note that would be of interest to prosecutors looking at potential foreknowledge of the  attacks pertains to eberhart’s dual role as commanderinchief of us space command where he was responsible for setting something called the “infocon threat level” established in march  the infocon threat level was designed as a measure of the threat to defense department computer systems and networks and different levels required different protocols for securing communications and information systems at  pm on september   less than  hours before the attacks began eberhart reduced infocon to level   the lowest threat level making it easier for hackers to compromise defense department systems and controls eberhart has never been asked about this change in the public record there are a laundry list of other questionable actions that eberhart took on  his failure to implement military control over us airspace his decision to drive from peterson air force base to norad’s cheyenne mountain control center at  am right in the middle of the attack despite knowing this would involve loss of communication for part of the drive and the fact that it took him  minutes to complete the  minute trip his decision to ground all fighter jets by ordering them to battle stations instead of ordering them to scramble at  am and even norad’s inability to turn over basic documentation to government investigators the official story of  is a lie but eberhart’s story is a lie within that lie designed to absolve himself and other members of the us military charged with defending american airspace that morning from the most catastrophic failure in that mission in their history and not only did eberhart survive with his career intact he was praised as a “ hero” and moved into the private sector after leaving norad in  as chairman and board member of a number of companies that directly benefited from the post police state and the post war on terror ralph e eberhart remains at large filed in videostagged with  • norad subscribe if you

is considered “not advertiserfriendly” includes but is not limited to – controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown” james it would appear that your subject matter is not deemed sufficiently controversial nor sensitive by youtube to warrant censorship i am puzzled by this how are you managing to stay while others are complaining they have been invited to leave log in to reply corbett says  at  pm this whole recent story about youtube censorship is wrong on every level there has been no change in youtube policy the crackdown began a year and a half ago which i reported on at the time httpswwwcorbettreportcomp and it is not about “censorship” in the “delete your video” sense but monetization of videos which doesn’t affect me since i do not monetize my videos anyway so in short don’t believe everything you read on the internet log in to reply mclare says  at  am “don’t believe everything you read on the internet”… says the gentleman on the internet forgive me that you are distributing your carefully and ingeniously crafted information and reaching hundreds of thousands of people occasionally strikes me as too good to be true there is no santa claus there is no easter bunny there is no god there is no democracy the leaders of the western world are not the good guys there are no “peace keepers” there is no moral coalition of benevolent souls uniting to fight climate crisis there is no climate crisis there is no justice there is no truth in mainstream media there was no osama bin laden striking fear into a free america because he “hates our freedom” there was no airplane at the pentagon there were no weapons of mass destruction there was no lone deranged gunman in …ad nauseum… my parents misled me the church lied to me the media lied to me the politicians lied to me my school lied to me noam chomsky let me down…… the pattern has repeated since the day i was born james corbett hasn’t yet disappointed me…and believe me i’m looking carefully with the cross armed posture of a skeptic if you are as i suspect you are the real deal i worry about your safety if you manage to add a couple of zero’s to your subscribership i haven’t been able to poke any holes in your arguments yet but…i owe it to myself and you not to accept every word you post as gospel thanks for the reminder   especially i want to thank you for this recent  video effort again it’s all too good to be true sincerely ryan log in to reply ralphodavis says  at  pm i won’t hazard a guess on how many times in my relatively recent exposure to tcr james has stressed the importance of not merely verification of what’s presented but invitation to actively contribute opensource documentation of facts that’s how this place works allin responsibility for material analysis and opinion maybe just rather ‘good to be true’ eh cheers log in to reply voiceofarabi says  at  am well… hats of to you mr corbett… that was excellent work and worth every second spent watching it congratulations… on another note what does corbett nation think of anonymous i stumbled on the video below posted  days ago and watched over  times so far the scary part is everything in this video is very accurate they seem to be people in the know and not just some hackers… anonymous – message to the citizens of the world v httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcheivsldm james did you do an article on anonymous what do you think of them log in to reply mclare says  at  am i apologize you didn’t ask me but…i strongly suspect anonymous are gate keepers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgdgazioxi likewise for the young turks likewise for bill maher likewise for noam chomsky it is a hurculean task to distinguish the snake oil salesmen log in to reply jayz says  at  am i’m with you mclare on leaning toward anonymous being gatekeepersa deep state operation as well… but unlike assange snowden and the others you mentioned anonymous pointing toward  being a false flag is a significant thing does anyone know if this is the first time they’ve mentioned that in their official videos in any case i’m interested in corbett’s thoughts on this as well   if not before here’s a good qfc james what’s your overall take on “official” anonymous at this point and what’s your take on them pointing to  being a false flag operation in this video that voa posted above a great community of researchers and activists here most of whom strive to be reflective and mature in their engagement of one another and the very important sensitive subject matter james his guests and this community continue to give me hope and passion about our future as humanity thank you all log in to reply voiceofarabi says  at  am hi mclare thanks for answering my question and i am glad you did it makes it more interesting when it is a collaborative effort i agree with you  on the young turks bill maher noam chomsky and i will even throw in infowars because i have seen enough of their material to make a judgment but this is the first time i have seen anonymous i have watch  videos all titled message to the citizens of the world and i must admit it appears to be well informed and not keeping anything away i did not care much for the graphics and just listened to audio but i could be mistaken why do you suspect that they maybe gatekeepers log in to reply mclare says  at  am voiceofarabi i was enthusiastic about their work at first but became disillusioned i regret that i can’t recall what initially led me to suspect “anonymous” however the link i provide above regarding their position on climate crisis is a quick example and is enough for me corbett pilato edmonds and others have the balls to put their name behind their work… i spoke to an individual who doubts the  legend which got us talking but swallows climate crisis chemtrails and thinks there is compelling evidence the world is flat and the moon landings were faked i know another guy who “knows” climate crisis is bs but refuses to discuss  we are thus divided and conquered you can fool all of us some time some of us all the time but you can’t fool all of us all the time some of us will stumble upon inconsistencies that get us asking questions i believe there is a gatekeeper to lead these folks safely down the garden path david icke is another example donald trump is another i believe the role of donald trump is to lump those asking questions together on the same leaky boat we will all go down with the ship when he loses the election anybody who challenges  is a gullible racist loony tin foil hats all around i suspect anonymous are performing a similar service log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am mclare there is the possibility that chomsky is not a gate keeper at least in the way some mean in that he’s agreed to be on the payroll could be that he was threatened into boundaries which to me is a totally different situation than say the young turks and maher who are disgusting steaming piles does anyone have thoughts on this distinction or chomsky in particular log in to reply mclare says  at  am intimidation why have corbett pilato edmunds and richard gage not been threatened i think the last thing the bastards need at the moment is a martyr… martyrdom lends legitimacy tin foil hats peer pressure gaming distraction and systematic brainwashing are cleaner and much more effective violence is a last resort they have learned much and refined their methods since the days of the great wars chomsky is brilliant i have a hard time believing he swallows the  fairy tale he could very well have been threatened i don’t care if he has the two obvious motivations for the types of sociopathic behaviour corbett is shining a spotlight on at present are greed and fear is it possible that a more altruistic motivation is also making a significant contribution to the justification of these atrocities log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  pm i’ve been told that the key is credibility for a renowned prof at mit to come out and say  was an inside job is completely different from an unknown knownothing canadian blogger in japan no offense james just framing the debate the people with credibility need to be kept in line or gotten rid of is my impression look at the eye witnesses who dropped dead the marines who go public michael hastings credibility is the key and the threats are more likely against his family than him it doesn’t matter if you care or not the fact is that few people would sacrifice their children in that way and expecting them to is just not realistic log in to reply nick says  at  pm ccuthbert it seems illogical that if credibility is the key you would go about keeping that by holding non credible views on particular topics  and jfk for chomsky in particular i assume you have seen the corbett vid on chomsky gatekeeper in any event i think even if your suggested reasons for chomskys compliance are correct mclare’s point is also correct if your credibility is not beyond reproach for whatever reason then you are a shill because how can anyone possibly differentiate what you lie remain willfully ignorant about vs what you are being honest about you are basically in the same pot as all the rest it is the essence of counter intelligence stirring in  crap with  truth so people being given the message chuck the baby out with the bathwater even the craziest of the crazies david icke speaks truth on  percent of what he talks about if chomsky is on the payroll be it for cash or the safety of his family which im sorry he just has to be for such an intellect to unequivocally state there is nothing even suspicious that has any credibility re  inside job then how can he be trusted any more than a david icke type log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  pm sorry i guess i wasn’t clear about what i meant by credibility the credibility that i’m referring to is that which the general public assigns to someone the general public would certainly think that an mit prof is highly credible just by his position i’m not referring to chomsky being credible due to his opinion on  or anything else in this context credibility is all about appearances that’s why i said that james isn’t “credible” while chomsky is therefore i think james has little to fear from tptb wanting to bump him off they would more likely marginalize him ralphodavis says  at  pm “in this context credibility is all about appearances” this says more about superficiality and popular distortion of definition than anything c’mon  realities are no mere matter of opinion one demonstrable reality is the overt and pronounced ambivalence to open and unfettered independent investigation of facts proffered by chomsky himself mit is the inner academic sanctum of the pentagon to make any comparison between corbett v chomsky is pure strawman stuffing  btw i’m being polite 😉 one is about facts the other pretentious and pernicious propaganda log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am it seems you are again completely missing my point sigh the question was will tptb bump off james i suggest no because in the estimation of the majority  or even plurality of americans james is not credible because he’s an unknown unconnected nonothing canadian blogger somewhere in japan v a member of the intelligentsia i am not commenting on james’ or chomsky’s work on the quality of the information or anything else in general i doubt that tptb are interested in assassinating joe blow on the internet they would be and we have evidenced that they are very interested in famous experts eye witnesses movie stars and journalists who stray off the reservation i hope this is clear now bc i’m getting tired of talking at cross purposes ccuthbert says  at  pm “is it possible that a more altruistic motivation is also making a significant contribution to the justification of these atrocities” where are you going with this please log in to reply mclare says  at  pm re credibility a colleague  the office ended a climate crisis debate by bringing up the nasa web page he asked me how many missions to the moon i had under my belt the answer is of course none who am i to contradict the official nasa gospel on the matter case dismissed nist popular mechanics nasa mit professors ok…ccuthbert…your question as i am of the “working class” i spend  hrs  week working or commuting  hrs  week running a household  hrs  week parenting……but i have spent some time imagining what it might be like to be one of the super elite they don’t need to waste their waking hours with such trivial matters what would they think about with all of their free time empathy with a sociopath given that  oil is a finite resource and  human population continues to rise it is logical to conclude that peak oil is an inevitability the consequences of peak oil would be extreme hardship hunger cold and war i considered the following moral dilemma years ago when people were starving in africa which scenario represents the moral high ground  allow  million to starve to death today or  feed them so that  million starve to death  years later if i was an accountant i would say feeding them would be three times as cruel as letting them starve to death again i’m empathizing with a sociopath gulf of tonkin  american soldiers die   citizens and  troops   dead  was five times more humane than vietnam wearing the sociopathic bean counter hat military industrial complex employs many ending it results in millions of engineers factory workers secretaries etc etc not bringing bacon home to their families military industrial complex is in the business of war there will be blood there has been a  reduction in american blood and…well…the same amount of brown skinned blood gets spilled can’t be helped now same logic applies to peak oil the elite are having the slaves build the green infrastructure georgia guide stone commandment  says half a billion representatives of the human race can sustain themselves on the remaining half of the world’s oil inheritance q what is more humane allowing our population to swell to  billion and having to wipe out  billion of us or wiping out  billion of us today the sociopathic bean counter will say the altruistic option is to eliminate half as many people the sooner the better is it possible we’re in the final push to commission the great green infrastructure for the benefit of the offspring of the chosen ones before the virus is released years from now the offspring of the elite will look at our empty cities and the green infrastructure with the same wonder we express today for the great pyramids log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am you could add to your argument the vaccination effort and slathering people with pesticides both of which reduce fertility not sure how to respond to your idea other than to propose that psychopaths don’t have the empathy you’re suggesting quien sabe skydog says  at  pm when chomsky said that it didn’t really matter who did  that was when he outed himself as being one of them log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am letter to paul craig roberts posted on his webpage today at httpwwwpaulcraigrobertsorgfromareader i’m a retired career firefighter having served over  years on a fd in a medium size midwest city during those years i was on many a fire scene and yes even a few highrise fires also saw some ‘pancake’ collapse structure fires and none of those looked like the wtc collapses a pancake collapse has the floors falling down on top of each other looking like a pile of pancakes on a plate hence the term a pancake collapse building will fall down in a random haphazard manner not freefall and doesn’t emit a large cloud of pulverized contents hundreds of feet high and blocks long making it look like a volcano exploded neither does a pancake collapse generate enough energy to eject a  ton steel beam nearly  feet and still have enough energy left over to impale the beam into another building nor does a pancake collapse turn humans into tiny bits of nothing leaving only bone fragments no bigger than a fingernail nor does a pancake collapse evaporate thousands of tons of steel and concrete i’ve read some of the nyfd radio transcripts from that day from a crew working the fires in one of the towers they radioed command that the main body of fire was out leaving only ‘mopup’ duty mopup is putting our small fires that aren’t really dangerous but could reignite the structure so best extinguish them they also said they were going to start providing medical care to the victims which means they inspected the fire floor and determined it was safe enough to provide medical care in place if the floor had been deemed unsafe they would of begun moving the victims to a lower level then their world blew up killing  nyfd firefighters slowly the real news behind whathappened on  is coming out i just pray that the truth is exposed soon before all these me wars that are based on the  lies turn into ww iii thank you for your brave reporting on this literally life or death situation log in to reply skydog says  at  pm i wrote that letter to mr roberts and i’ll add my name to the same greg bacon of boonville mo i didn’t belong to this site before today so couldn’t leave a comment but will definitely do so now  is the biggest lie and con job of the century maybe of all time and it behooves us to keep plugging away at this monstrosity until it is exposed we can’t afford to wait for the truth to dribble out over decades the way matters are proceeding we don’t have the time on  i watched  of my fellow brother and sister firefighters die a horrible death murdered by their own government and swore that day to never stop asking questions until the real perps are outed thanks to mr corbett that is becoming less of a chore log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  pm you’re very brave skydog and you’re also “credible” so please be careful thank you for your enlightening comment log in to reply homeremedysupply says  at  pm greg thanks so

to reply buddhaforce says  at  am great series james log in to reply bcrsmith says  at  pm thank you james a brilliantly simple idea for a video series you may never get any awards for your work but it is making a huge contribution and greatly appreciated log in to reply nick says  at  pm ccuthbert sorry for the misunderstanding but guess my wider point is a gatekeeper is more about the effect than the motivation if chomsky gatekeeps for ‘moral’ reasons the gate is kept all the same i understand though that if your hypothesis on his motivations were correct then it gets trickier gets back to a more philosophical question we see in mmp type political systems like here in nz where smaller parties have to work with bigger parties who go against their general principles to achieve anything ie better inside the tent the out but again thats where the rubber hits the road if you sell your principles for any price be it noble or not then you cant be trusted cause you have declared your principles have a price and its just a case of meeting that price log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am agreed please don’t apologize this is a good discussion if difficult due to the nature of a written forum 😉 log in to reply mclare says  at  am i don’t care if you think the way i do what i care about is whether or not you think having banged my head against the mainstream media wall cbc for years i can’t begin to tell you how encouraged i am by the privilege of interacting with open minded people thank you all especially jc log in to reply russellm says  at  am well maybe the reason there was no air force response because there were no planes to respond to this was covered in many alternative investigations after  there are many inconsistencies surrounding the planes  the amount of wreckage recovered  amount of damaged caused pentagon  one or two of the planes was recorded as being grounded that day or one bearing the same identity number shows up landing at another airport some time after  ect a former cia employee and pilot by the name of john lear of lear jet fame has information suggesting that the air force prior to  has military grade holographic hardware that can be mounted on a plane that can produce and project an image that looks like and sounds like a real plane log in to reply homeremedysupply says  at  am russellm unfortunately the “no planes” concept is an infiltrated idea there are other infiltrated ideas historically i watched many infiltrated concepts develop through people such as cia asset morgan reynolds and deep state sponsored loonies such as judy woods infiltration is really about a meme a cultural aspect unwittingly swallowed a concept which kind of manifests itself by behavior which benefits “the powers that shouldn’t be” we now have a regression in some of the alternative “truther” media such as alex jones who promotes trump as the white obama and promotes discord rage even prejudice against muslims a valid alternative media will “care” and strive towards unifying people offering solutions and promoting activism in the real world a valid alternative media cites references a valid alternative media targets the reality of the type of audience it is presenting itself to eg a message to a new person should be different simpler than a message to an old hat who has kept abreast many “awoken” people have been compromised by an infiltrated meme they spend their days only chatting backnforth to the choir but never taking effective action or solutions to the real world “the powers that be” must be laughing… …lots of forums and chats alone in itself will never change real world scenarios because it takes real world interaction log in to reply ccuthbert says  at  am home this “were there or weren’t there planes” is a real dilemma from the very first time i saw the first “plane crashing into the building” i thought the video was fake it looks like the plane effortlessly flew into steel and concrete and left a hole like wiley coyote on the canyon floor–including the wing tips this is simply ridiculous and could not happen what it means however is still a mystery were the crashes faked and bombs set off did planes really hit but fake vids were released to confuse us i don’t know but i do know that if planes hit they wouldn’t have effortlessly entered the buildings leaving a perfect silhouette there are likewise excellent questions about the amazing pix judy woods shows in her book whatever her conclusions are were these pix photoshopped and if so why so that woods could come along and “reveal” amazing magical weapons that tptb have to really scare the hoi polloi into line be that as it may you are correct that divide and conquer is continuing to be successful james certainly helps the situation with this series avoiding the possible red herrings and going for mainstream video to out the criminals follow the money was great in this regard too log in to reply homeremedysupply says  at  pm ccuthbert jeremy rys is good to go to about judy woods httpbloggercomnewswhatrealinvestigationwouldreveal steven jones thoroughly nailed her i remember when she came on the scene with fetzer…what a mess jones has a good scientific paper on her stuff but the time line history of judy woods and fetzer would make a person puke at how they tried to hijack the movement and how they caused a big mess the hologram concept is out there to discredit the truth movement that is what it accomplishes some people in our truth group hold to the above ideas that is fine if one wants to hold these ideas it is still america anyone can have an opinion but those ideas are harmful when approaching a new public with them…it hurts the movement our group focuses primarily on sharing aetruth with new public and we do non  issues like vaxxed and fluoride and health etc log in to reply nick says  at  pm hi homeremedysupply pardon my ignorance but what is your truth group that you refer to here log in to reply

on september th at our dallas sign wave we had some folks come by after hearing about it at corbettreport thank you and thank you for the donations towards more free dvds we even had a  year old engineer aetruth petition signer come join holding signs visibility being visible in the real world not just cyber lets other who are aware know that they are not alone and it lets the unaware know that the issue of the  coverup it real world not a cyberblurb …and talk about courage one fellow arrived late when we were all packed up with our group sign wave ready to head home he said “well i need to do my part” and so he grabbed two signs and went at it alone on the busy intersection visibility in the real world is key in our personal daily aspects we all can do our part in being visible with this information mik says  at  am ccuthbert russellm judy woods might sound ok if you are not familiar with physics constructions materials… she is building her story on a premise that plane made of aluminum is soft and fragile but building made of steel and concrete is hard and tough in case of plane crashing into a building the most important thing is kinetic energy plane had almost  tons and it was flying at  knots tremendous energy you cannot apply knowledge of everyday physics in this case situation is in fact similar to kinetic energy weapons like armor piercing ammunition the most important characteristic of material used in this ammunition is its density du tungsten to get big mass since kinetic energy is a product of mass and velocity squared projectile simply gets through passes through obstacle because of kinetic energy log in to reply leave a reply click here to cancel reply you must be logged in to post a comment «  suspects robert baer  suspects dancing israelis »
