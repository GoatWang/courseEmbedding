katherine mdciarao ratedi found this dr on the avmed physician directory i went in for my first visit yesterday and it was a very nice surpriselocation the office is located in a large intersection the regions bank building on th and biscayne so its impossible to miss it parking is free and offices are tidy staff the reason why i chose this dr to begin with was the service i got over the phone i went through a list of places and most places had really unprofessional and rude receptionists at which case i hung up and tried a different number until bingo i hit this office the receptionist is very polite and soft spoken she is very professional and just a pleasure to speak to very nice and friendly first plusi did wait a little longer than usual but the front desk young lady told me that my insurance was having technical difficulties and she couldnt get in touch with them they had a nice big flat screen tv in the reception which made my wait barely noticeabledr she is extremely nice and polite so genuinely concerned and listened to all my crazy rants and medical history ups and downs she was very receptive to all my comments and offered great advice and even helped me with recommendations on other specialists i should see she even had the front desk girl make copies with specialist information and wrote referrals so i wouldnt have any problems with my insurance covering my services she also took down the names of all my prescription meds and found cheaper alternatives and then sent them directly to my pharmacy so i wouldnt even have to bother dropping them off wow this place is really amazing and understands people and how to take care of them and their needs i would most definitely recommend this place luis c guerrero md paphilosophy t ratedreform does work ive known this doctor for overt  yrs great bedside manners and the oldschool technique of writing in a notepad is for your own id protection reform does work he is compassionate and does feel your pain he takes an interest in the entire family even though the family is not under his care he makes visits to hospitals and he is wellrounded highly qualified and i can understand why his patients believe he is is an angel who knows he might have studied in the seminary for some time as well all i know is that there is no subject that this professional does not now if a certain medication does not work he will find one that will work according to the patients symptoms as a matter of fact i dont know how is able to handle one patient after the next he handles some of the most bizzare complex cases to some of the most heartwarming ones this alone requires discipline congratulations dr you have made it in your field of passion you have made the journey that most of us quite frankly never find you sir have traveled the road less traveled this is wisdom  euripedes i found you quite worthy as a human being and doctor and i have no doubt that other scholars have found the same in you from all corners of the world mahatma ghandi mother teresa pope john paul ii and so may others would be proudchristopher hodgkins mdalex d ratedmy experience with dr hodgkins  his staff are excellent i was

stories ive heard  seen but my daughter n law had a tummy tuck with dr pazmino so when i saw how great he was with her i knew i had found my surgeon  his hands are blessed  im a few days out  the staff has really gone above  beyond for me  i feel so comfortable  when i first got there i met cathy who really made the financial part of this surgery possible  then  i met jesenia who i had spoken to on the phone before  really made me feel confident about what i was about to do going over some details about the procedure finally i had my visit before my surgery i met malena who went over what to expect  how i can best get ready for the surgery  i have truly had a smooth experience  im  days out and im barely bruised  feel great but if i feel  look great now  then i can only imagine in a few weeks  so excited to get some of my youth back christopher hodgkins mdoscar a rateddr hodgkins is a true professional and an amazing surgeon i fractured my ankle and when i visited dr hodgkins he explained everything in great detail and was there to answer every question i had i never felt rushed his bedside manners were great i knew that he would be the doctor to operate me the follow up post surgery was awesome they followed up to see if i felt good and if i had any questions for the doctor  weeks post surgery i feel great the office appointments are very punctual if your appointment is at pm you are in at pm they never make you wait more than  min the operation was a total success people see me walking now and cant believe i had surgery just a few weeks ago i would definitely

and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible

expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give
