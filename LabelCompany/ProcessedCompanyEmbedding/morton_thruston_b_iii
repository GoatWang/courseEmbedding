policy in  he was elected to the senate defeating earle c clements the democratic former kentucky governor who was then acting senate majority leader mr mortons brother rogers cb morton was a congressman from maryland secretary of the interior in the nixon administration and republican national chairman he died in  declined to run in  thruston morton a congressman of considerable prestige and fortitude was at the peak of his influence after more than a quarter of a century of public service when in  he abruptly decided not to seek reelection to use an old kentucky expression i suppose i am just plain track sore he said it was later learned that he was in ill health a close associate described him as profoundly depressed by the combination of the vietnam war urban violence and what he regarded as insufficient national leadership and the failure of the republican party to rise to the occasion although mr morton could be ferociously partisan he lined up at times with liberal democrats on vietnam and the civil rights movement at first he had embraced the johnson administrations vietnam policy but his views moderated as the war eroded the national pride and prestige in  when such critics of the war as senators robert f kennedy democrat of new york and edward m kennedy democrat of massachusetts suggested in speeches that corruption and lack of dedication in south vietnam were reaching the point at which the south vietnamese government no longer warranted the support of the united states it was senator morton who introduced the speeches into the congressional record cautioned johnson on running he also suggested that president johnson decline to seek reelection but he said i do not expect a man so mesmerized by power to relinguish it voluntarily when senator eugene j mccarthy of minnesota campaigned for the democratic nomination for the presidency that year he included mr morton among people he would consider naming as secretary of state because of the similarity of their outlook for his part mr morton helped the reluctant campaign of gov nelson a rockefeller of new york for the republican nomination he toured the country trying to generate enough popular interest to lead mr rockefeller to declare he felt that the republican party was risking extinction unless it turned to imaginative leadership he later became a cochairman of mr rockefellers campaign after his candidates loss to richard m nixon at the national convention in miami beach he joined the nixon campaign his brother rogers morton had been mr nixons convention floor manager in february  the month he announced his retirement he joined the bipartisan coalition of senate liberals that won a first round in the difficult senate debate on legislation to provide federal protection to people seeking to exercise their civil rights he was understood to have argued that in an election year republicans should not seem to align themselves with southern conservatives by voting for a southern substitute bill that would have limited federal protection thruston ballard morton was born in louisville and was graduated from yale university in  he joined the family business

with natural or organic foods enjoy walmarts inventory of organic delights which are made without artificial ingredients theyre grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers a food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products like different meats fruits vegetables grains and dairy products organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution the farmers who grow organic produce dont use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds for example organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds so what makes a product organic for certain the us department of agriculture usda established a certification program that requires all organiclabeled foods to meet strict government standards first these standards regulate how such foods are grown handled and processed thus any product labeled as organic must be usda certified you could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one but it s a much easier shopping
