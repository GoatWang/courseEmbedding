inccategory managing external stakeholders after an earnings disappointment adc telecommunications makes a wall street connectionlori calabro cfo magazineoctober   robert switz says hell never forget his embarrassment on january   thats the day the cfo of adc telecommunications inc had to level with wall street that the company was going to miss its firstquarter earnings estimates up until that time recalls the yearold switz adc had a record of  consecutive quarters of meeting or beating wall street expectations it was embarrassing to all of us to preannounce that we werent going to make our numbers but the embarrassment he says soon gave way to shock when our stock subsequently dropped  percent in value that shock deepened on january  when switz was forced to issue a second press release because business was going to turn out even worse than i had stated initially he says in response adcs shares dropped another  percent completing a downward spiral that sent the stock of the  billion supplier of voice video and data systems tumbling from a high of  on december   to  on january   to stem the tide switz launched a campaign to uncover the root causes of the selloff and regain investor confidence by constant communication and a simplified message switz spread the word that adc was a solid buy for the long term and in the year and a half since the crisiswhich switz calls a cathartic forcethe stock has regained its strength and then some in fact the company was recently added to the sps  index a testament to its staying power reputation is everything on wall street and bob earned his stripes with direct candor when it was needed most says kenneth m leon global sector head of abn amro inc after the earnings disappointment he adds bob did not hide or blame others he took a negative situation as an opportunity to work harder with analysts and institutional investors he was honest about what adc could do to improve its business and what was beyond its control ultimately the effort was a major factor in our recent growth in market capitalization says adc ceo william j cadogan it also won switz the  cfo excellence award for managing external stakeholders for switz however the ordeal was instructive just because people own your stock dont assume that they understand your company the fundamental lesson here he says is that you need to know as much about them as they know about you sucker punchedto say that the stock drop was a surprise to adc executives is an understatement until january  the minneapolisbased company was actually a bit of a darling of the communicationequipment sector says switz between october   and october   the stock had grown from  to  a compound annual growth rate of  percent most of the ir thrust until then focused on the technologies of the business he says when switz joined adc in  he lobbied to spend less time talking about bits and bytes and more time talking about how market strategies translated into financial success but as a newcomer switz was ignored the status quo after all was working just fine then in late  a combination of factors shook confidence in the company first the asian crisis began to be felt in addition analysts refused to account for seasonality issues every year the first quarter would drop from the fourth says switz in  however the fourth quarter was so strong that wall street ignored the seasonality most alarming to investors though was that rapid consolidation in the telecom industry throttled down business in a very rapid time frame any one of those factors says switz would not have damaged the stock price but taken together they were calamitous still he says we felt that with our reputation and performance the market should have been more forgiving particularly bewildering was the fact that the first quarter was a record one for adc even though the company missed expectations revival effortsto revive the stock switz believed he had to figure out why adc was being pummeled in the first place once the initial crisis had been resolved by weeks on the phone reassuring investors switz took to the road spending most of february and march  meeting with institutional shareholders what i discovered he says was that numerous groups of shareholders owned us simply because we had great financial performance and a good track record of meeting or beating expectations they didnt know anything about adc and they took its performance for granted many investors simply didnt understand adc explains switz their confusion is understandable given the companys diverse markets customers and technologies where many of its competitors deal in one particular communication technology adc operates in a segment of that market known as the local loop the portion of the network linking the service provider to the home or business this segment encompasses everything from broadband connectivity to systems integration and serves business residential and mobile customers says switz it was very difficult to understand adc in  seconds to help with the problem switz hired mark borman as vice president of investor relations in february  together they simplified the adc story starting with the ir presentation which had leaned too heavily on charts and schematics kicked off with a new tag linetotal solutions for lastmile networksthe new version clarified adcs products and strategies and its happy prospects for growth the web site was then retooled to bring this message to a wider audience the new site has been so successful that traffic has increased  percent other efforts included changing the earnings release to show results in each product group preparing plain english annual reports discontinuing the practice of prereleasing estimated revenues and starting a direct stock purchase plan so individuals can buy adc stock at low commissions what worked best though says switz was going out and pressing the flesh during  switz and borman presented at more than  conferences in fact in  switz averaged two days a week with current and potential investors over the long haul it is my job to cultivate interest in and demand for adc shares he says net impactswitz says he started seeing results in august  when the stock moved back into the  range i began to feel that investors were buying into what we were sayinghelped by a solid secondquarter performance there were other telltale signs we had an awful lot of new investors pick up adc he says east coast ownership increased from  percent to  percent between the end of  and august  sellside coverage increased from  analysts in  to the current  who maintain a consensus buy rating see chart above and inclusion in the sp  he says was a testament to adcs consistency after all he adds we are working on meeting or beating analysts expectations in  of  quarters adc stock took another hit in the october  fallout of tech stocks dropping to  per share but by this past september it was trading around  a share down from an all time high of  on april  switz is philosophical about the whole experience in the end he says there is no substitute for honesty candor and consistency especially in a crisis in retrospect switz who describes himself as a highmetabolism person doesnt believe he could have done anything different or better whether the analysts will ever forget that there was such a surprise however is another story forgive is probably a better word he says � cfo publishing corporation  all rights reserved robert e switz  executive bio compensation history and contacts  equilar
