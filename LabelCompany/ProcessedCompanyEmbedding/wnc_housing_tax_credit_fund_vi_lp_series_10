of units will be permitted only if the transferee meets the same suitability standards as had been imposed on the transferor limited partner  although a series direct control over the management of each apartment complex will be limited the series ownership of interests in local limited partnerships will in an economic sense be tantamount to direct ownership of the apartment complexes themselves a series normally will acquire at least a  interest in the profits losses and tax credits of the local limited partnerships however in certain cases the series may acquire a lesser interest in such partnerships each local limited partnerships partnership agreement will provide that distributions of proceeds from a sale or refinancing of an apartment complex will be paid to a series in the range of from  to   each series will have certain voting rights with respect to each local limited partnership the voting rights will include the right to dismiss and replace the local general partner on

partnership and to approve or disapprove amendments to the local limited partnership agreement materially and adversely affecting the series investment  each series will be controlled by the general partner pursuant to a partnership agreement the “partnership agreement” the limited partners consistent with their limited liability status will not be entitled to participate in the control of the business of the series however a majorityininterest of the limited partners will have the right to amend the partnership agreement subject to certain limitations to remove any general partner and elect a replacement and to dissolve the series in addition under the partnership agreement each limited partner is entitled to review all books and records of the series  applicants state that the partnership agreement and prospectus of the series contain provisions designed to ensure fair dealing by the general partner with the limited partners applicants also state that all compensation to be paid to the general partner and its affiliates is specified in the partnership agreement and prospectus applicants believe that the fees and other forms of compensation that will be paid to the general partner and its affiliates are fair and on terms no less favorable to the series than would be the case if such arrangements had been made with independent third parties  during the offering and organizational phase the general partner and its affiliates will receive a dealermanager fee and a nonaccountable expense reimbursement in amounts equal to  and  respectively of capital contributions the general partner has agreed to pay all organizational and offering expenses excluding selling commissions the dealermanager fee and the nonaccountable expense reimbursement  during the acquisition phase each series will pay the general partner or its affiliates a fee equal to  of capital contributions for analyzing and evaluating potential investments in local limited partnerships and for various other services the general partner and its affiliates will receive a nonaccountable acquisition expense reimbursement equal to  of capital contributions in consideration of which the general partner will pay all acquisition expenses of each series aggregate fees and expenses paid in connection with the organization of each series the offering of units and the acquisition of local limited partnership interests by each series will be limited by the partnership agreement and will comply with guidelines published by the north american securities administrators

limited partners each series will pay the general partner or its affiliates a fee equal to  of the sales price of the apartment complexes sold in which the general partner or its affiliates have provided a substantial amount of services the general partner also will receive  of any additional sale or refinancing proceeds  all proceeds from a series public offering of units initially will be

securities issued or guaranteed by the united states government and certificates of deposit or time or demand deposits in commercial banks upon receipt of a prescribed minimum amount of capital contributions for a series funds in escro will be released to the series and held by it pending investment in local limited partnerships  if more than one entity that the general partner or its affiliates advises or manages may invest in a particular investment opportunity the decision as to the entity that will be allocated the investment will be based upon such factors as the effect of the acquisition on diversification of each entitys portfolio the estimated income tax effects of the purchase on each entity the amount of funds of each entity available for investment and the length of time such funds have been available for investment priority generally will be given to the entity having uninvested funds for the longest period of time however any entity that was formed to invest primarily in apartment complexes eligible for state low income housing tax credits “state tax credits” as well as for federal low income housing tax credits will be given priority with respect to any investment that is eligible for state tax credits over entities which are not seeking to provide state tax credits applicants legal analysis  applicants believe that the fund and its series will not be “investment companies” under sections aa or ac of the act if the fund and its series are deemed to be investment companies however applicants request an exemption under section c and e of the act from all provisions of the act except sections  through  of the act and the rules and regulations under those sectionsstart printed page   section aa of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities applicants believe that the fund will not be an investment company under section aa because the fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes not securities  section ac of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items applicants state that although the local limited partnership interests may be deemed “investment securities” they are not readily marketable cannot be sold without severe adverse tax consequences and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the local limited partnerships  applicants believe that the twotier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the secs release concerning twotier real estate partnership the “release” the release states that investment companies that are twotier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the act pursuant to section c section c provides that the sec may exempt any person from any provision of the act and any rule thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section c permits the sec to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the act to comply with certain specified provisions of the act as though the company were a registered investment company  the release lists two conditions designed for the protection of investors which must be satisfied by twotier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section c first interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit essentially taxshelter investments would not be unsuitable second requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company  applicants assert among other things that the suitability standards set forth in the application the requirements for fair dealing provided by the partnership agreement and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each local limited partnership by various federal state and local agencies provide protection to investors in units in addition applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority start signature margaret h mcfarland deputy secretary end signature end
