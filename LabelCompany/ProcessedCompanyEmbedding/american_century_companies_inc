each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months since brokers often use different ratings systems each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of  sell  hold  buy or

developments judge beth phillips of the us district court for the western district of missouri tosses former execs retaliation case against american century cos inc nov   judge beth phillips of the us district court for the western district of missouri once again threw a lawsuit out of court that was filed against american century cos inc by tom kmak former ceo of its retirement plan services subsidiary kmak argued that the company retaliated against him for testifying against it in an arbitration case american century was embroiled in a dispute with jpmorgan chase  co and kmak was called to testify the case ended in  with american century winning a  million judgment after the winning the arbitration against jpmorgan chase american century used its call rights on company stock kmak bought while he was employed there from  to  he argued that the move cost him about  million in lost value and was done in retaliation american century argued that it regularly called in the stock of former employees to repurchase it and put it back into the company the company had no written policy related to the timing of calling in shares but typically waited about  months however in this case it actually waited longer because the company was embroiled in the legal battle with jpmorgan and didnt want the call of kmaks shares to become an issue in that case a decision was made to wait until after the case was over and then call the stock which the company did the judge ruled in favor of american century saying the company proved that calling in stock was a regular practice and kmak didnt provide proof that the call was being done to punish him for participating in the arbitration with jp morgan this is the second time a court issued a summary judgment throwing out kmaks lawsuit against american century the first time was in february  but the court allowed kmak to file an amended complaint to keep the suit going this time however phillips denied kmaks request to file another
