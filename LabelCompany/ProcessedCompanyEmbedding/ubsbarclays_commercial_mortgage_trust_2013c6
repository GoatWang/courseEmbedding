serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating fusion us cmbs transactions published in april  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology description of models used moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model v  which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions conduit model results at the aa sf level are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value conduit model results at the b sf level are based on a paydown analysis using the individual loanlevel moodys ltv ratio moodys may consider other concentrations and correlations in its analysis based on the model pooled credit enhancement levels of aa sf and b sf the required credit enhancement on the remaining conduit classes are either interpolated between these two data points or determined based on a multiple or ratio of either of these two data points for fusion deals moodys merges the credit enhancement for loans with investmentgrade credit assessments with the conduit model credit enhancement for an overall model result moodys incorporates negative pooling adding credit enhancement at the credit assessment level for loans with similar credit assessments in the same transaction moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf

performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool

and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  compared to  at moodys last review deal performance as of the march   distribution date the transactions aggregate certificate

stressed debt service coverage ratio dscr and the transactions herfindahl index herf are within acceptable ranges the ratings on the io classes were affirmed based on the credit performance or the weighted average rating factor or warf of the referenced classes moodys rating action reflects a base expected loss of  of the current balance compared to  at moodys last review the deal has not experienced any realized losses and moodys base expected loss plus realized losses is now  of the original pooled balance compared to  at the last review moodys provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion cmbs transactions on moodyscom at httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool loan concentration an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduitfusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology description of models used moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  the same as at moodys last review deal performance as of the february   distribution date the transactions aggregate certificate
