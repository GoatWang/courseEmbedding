  corporate logo for edgewell personal care david hatfield ceo of edgewell personal care st louis this month gained a new public company and a new corporate name with the successful split of energizer holdings into two consumer products giantsthe company that kept the energizer name is focused on batteries and lighting products and remains based in town and countrythe other edgewell personal care took over more than two dozen consumer brands many sold around the globe including schick razors banana boat sunscreen and wet ones hand wipes that portfolio of personal care brands generated  billion in sales last year based in chesterfield edgewell employs  people including  locallydavid hatfield the new chief executive of edgewell took a moment last week to reflect on the massive yearlong undertaking that created two companies and the strategy that will guide his company going forwardmost spinoffs involve only a small fraction of a company hatfield said in an interview but the separation of energizer’s household and personal care divisions was nearly a  split ratcheting up the complexity of the task“we divided a company across plus countries” he said “folks have done a superb job and we’re looking forward to a new beginning”hatfield didn’t stop to ruminate on the past for long however edgewell is putting a bigger priority on international growth than it did previously he said and the company is investing heavily in innovation to develop new products acquisitions — a critical part of the company’s prior growth — will help propel the company’s global growth he addedhatfield started at eveready’s battery division in   years before energizer and the eveready brand were spun off from ralston purina co during his career he helped oversee several major acquisitions as energizer diversified beyond its battery base including purchasing the schickwilkinson sword razor business in  for  million and the  billion acquisition of playtex products in  with the battery division now a separate company edgewell can focus on its core business personal care products hatfield said“we compete in attractive categories and we have strong brands” he saidin addition to schick razors and edge and skintimate shaving preparation products that account for  percent of edgewell’s sales edgewell’s brands include hawaiian tropic sunscreen and playtex and ob tampons feminine care and sunskin care each account for about  percent of sales with infant and other products totaling  percent of sales “we’ve been built through acquisitions over time” hatfield said “we have a legacy of disciplined ma and we look to continue that going forward our philosophy is we look to stay close to our core we’re going to look at businesses in categories we compete in particularly in suncare and adjacencies such as skin care and grooming”razor focuswith razors and shaving prep products accounting for more than half of its business the segment is edgewell’s no  focus hatfield said edgewell’s wet shave net sales totaled  billion in fiscal  with  percent of sales in north america  percent in europe  percent in asia and  percent in latin america“management will be relying on increased investment behind the growth brands innovation leveraging of the entire portfolio including private label and international expansion particularly in developing markets” john faucher a jp morgan analyst wrote in a recent research note procter  gamble’s gillette is the market leader for razors in the us followed by edgewell’s schick brand both gillette and schick face increasing competition from harry’s and dollar shave club which are growing their online razor saleshatfield said he’s watching the online competitors closely“that’s an interesting phenomenon that we have to watch” he said adding that most online competitors aren’t profitable and are burning through cashif the online competitors survive hatfield said edgewell’s private label razor business could act as suppliers “we’re positioned well to help them” he said business briefing from st louis postdispatch make it your business get twicedaily updates on what the st louis business community is
