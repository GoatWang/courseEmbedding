highermar  about tekla healthcare thq value and income insights long only value special situations contrariansummaryhealthcare stocks are poised to benefit from demographic trendsnew technologies including immunotherapy and personalized medicine will drive healthcare stocks higherthis fund should benefit from its strong management team with a proven track record in managing closedend fundsoverview healthcare stocks have been strong performers for the past several years the sector is benefiting from higher utilization rates due to demographic trends and increased access to healthcare because of the affordable care act the tekla healthcare opportunities fund nysethq is a closedend fund that was launched in  to invest in the healthcare sector thq is managed by tekla capital management which also manages two other closedend funds tekla life sciences investors nysehql and tekla healthcare investors nysehqh both of which have attractive performance track records the market is currently offering thq at a  discount to nav this wide discount is attractive on an absolute basis it is also an attractive discount on a relative basis when compared to other funds managed by tekla currently hql trades at a  premium and hqh trades at a  premium the ability to access a strong management team trading at a wide discount is attractive the investment case for thq is bolstered by the strong tailwinds in the healthcare sector and the funds  distribution key investment highlights new technologies there has been a significant amount of innovation in the healthcare sector in the past  years the human genome project which mapped the human genome was completed in  and has provided significant insight into the human body this insight has translated into a wide range of new technologies including personalized medicine and immunotherapy these insights have led to new drug development with the fda approving  drugs in  which is the most since  continued innovation should help drive earnings for healthcare companies increasing demand the demand for healthcare is expected to continue to increase driven by aging demographics and the affordable care act aca people spend more on healthcare as they get older in the us the baby boomers are getting older and increasing their use of healthcare products and services the aca is also expected to increase utilization as it will give more people access to healthcare insurance the requirement to have healthcare insurance should also increase the percentage of paying customers reducing charity care and improving healthcare company profitability these trends should provide a tailwind for healthcare stocks for years to come strong management team tekla capital management has shown strong performance in the other healthcare focused cefs that they manage hqh has posted a  annual nav return for the year period ending  hql has posted a  annual nav return for the year period ending  both of these returns compare favorably to the health care select sector spdr nysearcaxlv which has a year average annual return of  these returns show that the tekla management team has the ability to post attractive returns thq should benefit from this strong management team discount to nav thq is trading at a  discount to nav and offers a  distribution the funds discount is likely driven in part by technical aspects of cef trading cefs ipo at a premium and often swing to a discount over time while average historical discounts arent available due to thqs recent launch other funds managed by tekla trade at premiums to their nav it would not be surprising for the discount to narrow over time if thq posts strong performance key investment risks healthcare valuations some market participants have voiced concern about valuations in the market overall and the healthcare sector in particular using the xlv as a proxy for healthcare stocks and the spdr sp  etf nysearcaspy as a proxy for the market we can see that xlv currently trades at higher valuations the forward pe ratio pricebook ratio and peg ratio are all higher than the sp while the dividend yield is lower source spdrscom as of  investors should be aware of these higher valuations and consider them as well as the tailwinds for the healthcare sector mentioned above before investing pharmaceutical patent cliffs and biosimilars many blockbuster drugs are beginning to lose patent protection allowing generic competition additionally there is a likelihood that biosimilar drugs will be launched in coming years to provide alternatives to large molecule biologic drugs that have lost their patent protection the launch of generic drugs will have a negative effect on many pharmaceutical companies revenues and margins however this risk cuts both ways for the healthcare sector overall as it could drive pharmaceutical companies to make acquisitions the expiration of patent protection also offers opportunities for companies manufacturing the generic drugs pricing pressure from pbms many new drugs are coming to market with very high price tags this is causing concern for healthcare payers pharmacy benefit managers pbms like express scripts nasdaqesrx have started to fight back and attempt to get pricing concessions they are limiting covered drugs and pressuring patients to take lower cost products they are also working to get drug companies to compete for a spot of the formularies based on price this focus on high priced drugs and the coming pricing pressure could pressure margins for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies key portfolio metrics market capitalization  million average daily volume shares  portfolio turnover  premiumdiscount  current monthly distribution  market distribution rate  nav distribution rate  effective leverage  performance using etfs with similar investment objectives gives a good comparison to allow for evaluation of the fund managements performance thq invests in the healthcare sector primarily in us companies so xlv provides a good proxy so far thqs nav performance has been in line with or exceeded xlv however thq is a new fund having launched on  so there isnt a significant track record available to judge performance market price performance for thq has trailed as the fund has moved from a premium at ipo to the current  discount data as of  source morningstar premiumdiscount source cefconnect the fund closed  at a  discount to the nav or underlying value of the portfolio because of the short trading record of the fund there isnt a year average available with which to compare the discount thq lost its ipo premium in  and has traded with a persistent discount in  however other healthcare funds managed by tekla trade at a premium to nav thq could offer an attractive entry point at the current discount expense ratio the management fee is  of daily managed assets the fund has also entered into a services agreement with the advisor the annualized management fee and other expenses came to  in  the total expense ratio for the fund is in line or below expectations for a sector specific fund distribution thq pays a monthly managed distribution the current distribution is share this equates to an annual distribution yield of  based on current market prices leverage thq uses an options overlay but currently does not employ other leverage liquidity thq is a mediumsized cef with  million in net assets trading volume is robust with  shares traded on an average day trading volume represents  million in daily volume at current prices this offers a reasonable amount of liquidity for a cef individual investors should not have problems getting orders filled it is always wise to use limit orders to purchase or sell shares of closedend funds as the bidask spread can be wide management thq is managed by tekla capital management tekla has a talented management team focused on healthcare tekla is a relatively unknown investment manager focused on the healthcare sector thq is one of three funds managed by tekla the performance track record of the other tekla funds has been strong providing confidence that thqs management team has the ability to pick stocks that will outperform portfolio asset allocation source tekla as of  currently the portfolio is primarily invested in common stocks the portfolio does hold some fixed income and convertible securities the fund is expected to be a total return vehicle that will hold fixed income to help protect capital in bear markets due to the recent launch the fund does hold an elevated level of cash this will allow the fund to take advantage of opportunities as they arise industry allocation source tekla as of  thq has a diverse portfolio of healthcare stocks with representation from most healthcare industries the fund does have a large allocation to biotechnology companies this bet has paid off as biotech companies have been some of the strongest performing stocks recently top holdings source tekla as of  thq has a relatively concentrated portfolio with only  holdings and  of assets in the top  holdings it will be important to watch the funds turnover as it matures other funds managed by tekla have relatively low turnover hqh has an annual turnover of  and hql has an annual turnover of  the inclusion of fixed income and the use of an options strategy may contribute to a higher turnover in this fund relative to other funds managed by tekla strategy thqs investment objective is to seek current income and longterm capital appreciation through investment in companies engaged in the healthcare industry thq will invest in equity securities debt securities and pooled investment vehicles the fund uses an option selling strategy to enhance distributions from the portfolio options thq sells options from time to time to generate additional income on the portfolio conclusion thq is an attractive investment taking advantage of new healthcare technology and demographic trends increasing healthcare utilization driven by the affordable care act should also provide a tailwind while the cef is relatively new it is managed by the experienced team at tekla capital management which has proven successful managing other healthcare focused cefs thqs current discount to nav offers an attractive entry point
