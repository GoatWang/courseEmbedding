you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews harris  bunchrobert j ratedmy experience with attorney jeff bunch and this firm was really good my friend recommended me and i am very happy with the outcome of my case and the way i was treated i see his review below randolph s i agree with all the good reviews below i was being sued by bank of america and they won my case now i do not have to pay anything mr bunch is a great lawyer in court i also want to say a word about his assistant lisa she always made time for me even when i showed up without an appointment she is really busy and sometimes she would have to call me back or i would have to leave a message but she always  and i mean always  called me back i do not like the cobb county court the room was really dingy and the room was too hot with all the people the staff was okay i would never be a lawyer but mr bunch did a good job of preparing me for what to expect he even arranged for me to go to the courtroom and practiced with me in the actual witness stand so that i would not be as scared when i testified i think he spent a lot more time with me than he actually charged me for and he deserves a word of thanks for that i think i should also mention that this lawyer was always early every day i had to meet with him or go to court he was there before i was i never had to wait  like a doctors waiting room  except when i did not have an appointment i probably bugged him too much about my case but he was always nice about it i do not like the fact that he will not meet out of the office for lunch i tried to get him to come to lunch on several occasions but he was always too busy at least he always was honest about it also i do not like the coffee in his office it is way way too strong but i did not think that was a reason to withhold a starjackel  phillips pcpeterthune ratedfrom the first time i spoke wiabove and beyond my expectations from the first time i spoke with chris and dana which was back in  all the way up to our settlement today  they have been tenacious and considerate even when i was admittedly not the ideal client i hired jackel and phillips to represent my  year old son who was seriously injured in a horrible accident these attorneys were very persistent and organized they refused to accept the ampquotrun aroundampquot from anyone espeically the insurance company i trust them  they informed me about everything even if i did not ask both dana and chris were very easy to contact on the rare occasion that i had to leave a message they would return my call usually on the same day as far as the case goes i am more than pleased they got my son way more than i ever thought possible and structured the settlement for maximum returns in the future they handled everything with genuine care and concern the whole team at jackel and phillips is absolutely the best there is steven a cookelizabeth a ratedhe basically showed up to court late and when we went in front of the judge he did the minimal amount of speaking and did not advise me on options at all he was very quick to take the payment to the bank and cashed itm but when we wanted him to represent me he insisted we pay upfront and immediately before he would look at my file so payment was sent and promptly cashed in under  days time and he stopped returning phone calls and certified letters requesting status uodates or any information regarding my drivers license status etc he ignored certified mail requesting a refund for the nd payment and copies of all important documents required to go to the dmvthat was all back in november  he has yet to follow through with anything and other than being able to view his signature on the nd check he still is avoiding me my whole family and has left a bad taste for him and hes a perfect example of why people say lawyers are sleazy and liarsharris  bunch llcyasmine a ratedthis is a good lawyer attorney jeff bunch gets five stars from me only because i cannot think of anything he could have done better the first meeting had to be postponed because he had a trial which went one day later than expected so he met with me on saturday which impressed me he told me what to expect at my arraignment and then he convinced the prosecutor to dismiss my case at the first calendar call i never had to go in front of the judge one of the best things i think he did was that he made my arrest record disappear the thing i did not like is that he would always have to call me back but i could always talk with his paralegal lisa i probably called too much but she always talked to me and mr bunch always called me back when she said he would i also like the fact that i could make payments and his total charge was less than other lawyers i spoke with mr bunch is also a pretty nice guy for a lawyerabbott and abbott ppcmarie d ratedi received great service whilei received great service when hiring bj and parri abbott for a modification i met with parri for my consultation and was told the initial steps and about how long the first part of the process would take i was in touch with my paralegal both through phone and email frequently i didnt feel like any of the filing communication with opposing attorney getting in touch with me was longer than what should be expected everyone i dealt with was kind and helpful i didnt want a big firm where i was just a case number my ex husband and i went through our divorce three years prior handling the paperwork ourselves hiring the abbott firm was my first experience with attorneys i came to them with a list of expectation and they were all met i didnt have any of the issues the previous client mentioned i would use them again in the future if need be jones amp swansonmelissa ratedhighly professional and compethighly
