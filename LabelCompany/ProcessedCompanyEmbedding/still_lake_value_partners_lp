step when partnering with peo agencies and how does peo pricing work the cost of peo services as with any product or service the old adage that you get what you pay for also holds true with peos the cheapest peo isn’t always the way to go you’ll want to engage the best peo you can afford that also gives you the services you want since your peo will be handling many important functions of your business such as regulatory compliance and federalstate taxes the cost for service varies when evaluating price pay particular attention to the services that are included if the peo has a local presence how proactive they are in their service delivery and that you are comparing apples with apples there should be a fair correlation between value and price in most cases peos charge in two ways either a flat peremployee peryear charge pepy or as a percentage of total payroll a peremployee peryear peo quote simply charges a flat fee per employee this helps make the company’s expenses more predictable the second method of peo pricing is calculated by taking a percentage of the total payroll for each pay period typically between  percent a good peo can charge by either method depending on your requirements and preference in both scenarios you might incur additional fees because of other valueadded offerings such as additional employee benefits talent management products and
