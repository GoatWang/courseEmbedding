picture book with a twist from awardwinning author peter carnavas genre general fiction subject picture books reading level foundation lower primary school year preschool foundation year  ages  to  page count  peter carnavaswhere were you born where do you live now i was born in brisbane and grew up there until i was ten years old then i lived on the sunshine coast and after moving around a bit i’m back on the coast living in a beautiful little town called flaxton in the sunshine coast hinterland where did you go to school i first went to runcorn state school then currimundi state school then caloundra state high did you have a nicknamenot really  i think some friends called me peetor for a while i can’t remember why i’m trying to get people to call me pedro but it’s not really catching what were you like in school i was generally a quiet kid who did the right thing i managed to get accepted by some cool kids for a while in high school because i had long hair and could play the guitar it wasn’t until i reached year  that i found the friends i’d been looking for all along what is the naughtiest thing you did in year one i punched another boy for snatching my book off me the teacher gave me a smack and i probably got another one from my parents when i got home  what was your favourite book growing up one of my favourite memories is mrs melville reading danny the champion of the world by roald dahl to our class in year  i dived into books even more after that who is your favourite children’s author i have too many now i think libby gleeson’s picture book text is about as good as it gets what is your favourite foodcolourmovie my favourite foods are mango is summer and chicken soup in winter my favourite colour is generally blue of some sort although i like orange and sepia tones my favourite movie is a really old one from  called marty who inspired you to writeillustrate i had always drawn pictures and written short stories for no particular reason when i started teaching i became familiar with lots of picture books and their creators so i suppose they inspired me a lot my wife also encouraged me to give it a go and it helped that i had three nieces and a nephew to make up stories for in the beginning how did you get started i completed a picture book course with virginia lowe from create a kids’ book she taught me a lot about picture books and what makes a good picture book work at the end of the course i sent a dummy of my book jessica’s box to new frontier and it was published a little while laterhow old were you at that stage i was  when i started the course by the time i finished and submitted and redid all the illustrations the book was released when i was  i’d also managed to get married and have two kids in that timewhy did you want to be a writerillustrator i love picture books so much and i believe they contain as much meaning depth and wonder as any storytelling medium and i really just want to create stories that people might enjoy as much as i enjoy other picture books how do you think up ideasideas always come from different places but it usually involves something that gets me thinking and wondering about for a long time it is sometimes something i feel strongly about and want to translate into a picture book or sometimes it’s something that amuses me ideas occasionally pop into my head but it will usually come from something else in the beginning — a conversation a newspaper article something on tv or something i see when i’m walking my dog  do you have a special place where you writeillustrate i’ve turned our single car garage into my studio although there’s still room for a car when there’s a hailstorm on its way i have a big workbench area at the end with my paints sketchbooks and lightbox it’s a few steps away from the rest of the house so it really feels like i’m going to work every day what is the best thing about being a writerillustrator the best part about my job is being able to dream up stories and draw pictures all day it’s also a heap of fun when i visit schools it takes me months to work on single ideas but when i visit schools kids come up with hundreds of ideas in minutes  have you had any funny or embarrassing moment as a writerillustrator the funniest things come from the kids in the schools i visit a boy once said are you really  my mum’s  and she doesn’t have a beardwhat do you do when you are not writingillustrator i play music a lot and should really practise my piano accordion scales a bit more i spend lots of time with my daughters they sometimes let me drag them on a bushwalk or we go to the beach i love fishing but luckily for the fish i haven’t found much time to do it lately what would you have chosen to be if you were not a writerillustrator i’d probably still be a teacher or working in a library hiding in the picture book section when i was supposed to be working which famous person from the past would you like to talk
