received approval from the nyse to list its ticker “iipr” and was initially expected to have its shares price and go public this week “getting nyse clearance means there’s at least one less hurdle for cannabis ipos initial public offerings in the future” said matthew kennedy an analyst with renaissance capital a greenwich connbased manager of ipofocused exchangetraded funds etfs iip’s ipo could open doors for others to participate in the cannabis industry pharmacann’s general counsel told forbes “iip’s publiclytraded reit will be the very first opportunity for institutional investors to comfortably generate exposure to an industry that currently lacks the sort of transparency that sec oversight provides” however innovative industrial properties’ trip to wall street was delayed on monday iip officials disclosed in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission that the company’s founders may forego receiving some stock as part of the ipo — a sign that there is some pushback from investors kennedy said “with a newly formed reit they can’t really lower the valuation” kennedy said noting that the company’s chief executive “may decide to take less shares to effectively boost the value for ipo investors” ipo investors want a “clean story” with a company and there are some unprecedented risks with this company he said “i think the company definitely benefited from election results” he said noting the medical and recreational marijuana measures passing in eight states however that was dampened by the ongoing federal illegality of marijuana coupled with presidentelect donald trump nominating the antilegalization sen jeff sessions rala for the post of attorney general kennedy added “there is the possibility that the federal prosecutors would just seize the company’s assets” kennedy said such a potential occurrence was noted in the company’s list of “risk factors” following the sessions’ news renaissance capital officials noticed a selloff occur in marijuana stocks that trade on the overthecounter exchanges he said additionally there’s risk in that the company is a reit he said noting that interest in real estate investment trusts have trended down now that it looks like the federal reserve might raise interest rates as with other newly formed reits innovative industrial properties’ ipo will fund its first asset the quality and stability of the tenant are uncertain and the reit has no operating history nor a track record although its chairman does kennedy said as has been previously reported executive chairman alan gold took reits biomed realty trust and alexandria real estate equities inc public and sold biomed to the blackstone group in an  billion deal that closed earlier this year topics commercial cultivation
