performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company contingent income autocallable securities offer the opportunity for investors to earn a contingent quarterly payment equal to  of the stated principal amount with respect to each quarterly determination date on which the closing price of the underlying stock is greater than or equal to  of the initial share price which we refer to as the downside threshold level in addition if the closing price of the underlying stock is greater than or equal to the initial share price on any determination date the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment however if on any determination date the closing price of the underlying stock is less than the initial share price the securities will not be redeemed and if that closing price is less than the downside threshold level you will not receive any contingent quarterly payment for that quarterly period as a result investors must be willing to accept the risk of not receiving any contingent quarterly payment and also the risk of receiving shares of the underlying stock if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the closing price of the underlying stock is below the downside threshold level on the final determination date in which case investors will be exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying stock and the value of those shares investors receive at maturity will be significantly less than the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero accordingly the securities do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity and investors could lose their entire investment in the securities investors will not

the determination closing price is greater than or equal to the initial share price on one of the first three determination dates the securities are automatically redeemed following the relevant determination date in examples  and  the determination closing price on the first three determination dates is less than the initial share price and consequently the securities are not automatically

the securities involves significant risks we also urge you to consult your investment legal tax accounting and other advisors in connection with your investment in the securities investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the common stock of the dow chemical company the following is a nonexhaustive list of certain key risk factors for investors in the securities for further discussion of these and other risks you should read the sections entitled risk factors in the prospectus supplement including the risk factors discussed under the following headings          risk factorsrisks relating to all securities    risk factorsadditional risks relating to notes which are not characterized as being fully principal protected or are characterized as being partially protected or contingently protected    risk factorsadditional risks relating to notes which pay no interest    risk factorsadditional risks relating to securities with a barrier percentage or a barrier level    risk factorsadditional risks relating to securities which we may call or redeem automatically or otherwise and    risk factorsadditional risks relating to securities with reference assets that are equity securities or shares or other interests in exchangetraded funds that contain equity securities or shares or other interests in exchangetraded funds or that are based in part on equity securities or shares or other interests in exchangetraded funds     ■ the securities do not guarantee the return of any principal the terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not guarantee the payment of regular interest or the return of any of the principal amount at maturity instead if the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to maturity and if the final share price is less than the downside threshold level you will be exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying stock as compared to the initial share price on a  to  basis and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity a number of shares of the underlying stock equal to the exchange ratio times the adjustment factor or at our option the cash value of such shares the value of those shares or that cash will be less than  of the stated principal amount and could be zero     ■ the contingent quarterly payment is based solely on the determination closing price or the final share price as applicable whether the contingent quarterly payment will be made with respect to a determination date will be based on the determination closing price or the final share price as applicable as a result you will not know whether you will receive the contingent quarterly payment until the related determination date moreover because the contingent quarterly payment is based solely on the determination closing price on a specific determination date or the final share price as applicable if such determination closing price or final share price is less than the downside threshold level you will not receive any contingent quarterly payment with respect to such determination date even if the closing price of the underlying stock was higher on other days during the term of the securities     ■ you will not receive any contingent quarterly payment for any quarterly period where the determination closing price is less than the downside threshold level a contingent quarterly payment will be made with respect to a quarterly period only if the determination closing price is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level if the determination closing price remains below the downside threshold level on each determination date over the term of the securities you will not receive any contingent quarterly payments     ■ investors will not participate in any appreciation in the price of the underlying stock investors will not participate in any appreciation in the price of the underlying stock from the initial share price and the return on the securities will be limited to the contingent quarterly payment that is paid with respect to each determination date on which the determination closing price or the final share price as applicable is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level it is possible that the closing price of the underlying stock could be below the downside threshold level on most or all of the determination dates so that you will receive little or no contingent quarterly payments if you do not earn sufficient contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities the overall return on the securities may be less than the amount that would be paid on a conventional debt security of the issuer of comparable maturity     ■ contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity you should be willing to hold the securities to maturity if you sell the securities prior to maturity in the secondary market if any you may have to sell the securities at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the price of the underlying stock is above the downside threshold level page        contingent income autocallable securities due august   based on the performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company       ■ early redemption risk the term of your investment in the securities may be limited to as short as approximately three months by the automatic early redemption feature of the securities if the securities are redeemed prior to maturity you will receive no more contingent quarterly payments and may be forced to invest in a lower interest rate environment and may not be able to reinvest at comparable terms or returns     ■ reinvestment risk if your securities are called early the holding period over which you would receive the contingent quarterly payment could be as little as three months there is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the securities are called prior to the maturity date     ■ market price influenced by many unpredictable factors several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which barclays bank plc may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market although we expect that generally the closing price of the underlying stock on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor other factors that may influence the value of the securities include             o the trading price and volatility frequency and magnitude of changes in value of the underlying stock             o whether the determination closing price has been

until the securities mature             o geopolitical conditions and economic financial political regulatory or judicial events that affect the underlying stock and which may affect the final share price of the underlying stock             o the occurrence of certain events affecting the underlying stock that may or may not require an adjustment to the adjustment factor and             o any actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads           the price of the underlying stock may be and has recently been volatile and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen see the dow chemical company overview below you may receive less and possibly significantly less than the stated principal amount per security if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity     ■ the securities are subject to the credit risk of the issuer barclays bank plc the securities are senior unsecured debt obligations of the issuer barclays bank plc and are not either directly or indirectly an obligation of any third party any payment to be made on the securities depends on the ability of barclays bank plc to satisfy its obligations as they come due and are not guaranteed by a third party as a result the actual and perceived creditworthiness of barclays bank plc may affect the market value of the securities and in the event barclays bank plc were to default on its obligations you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the securities     ■ investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in the common stock of the dow chemical company investors in the securities will not own the underlying stock or have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the underlying stock     ■ no affiliation with the dow chemical company the dow chemical company is not an affiliate of ours is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of the securities we have not made any due diligence inquiry with respect to the dow chemical company in connection with this offering     ■ single equity risk the price of the underlying stock can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the underlying stock and its issuer such as stock price volatility earnings financial conditions corporate industry and regulatory developments management changes and decisions and other events as well as general market factors such as general stock market volatility and levels interest rates and economic and political conditions we urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the sec by the issuer of the underlying stock page        contingent income autocallable securities due august   based on the performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company       ■ we may engage in business with or involving the dow chemical company without regard to your interests we or our affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business with the dow chemical company without regard to your interests and thus may acquire nonpublic information about the dow chemical company neither we nor any of our affiliates undertakes to disclose any such information to you in addition we or our affiliates from time to time have published and in the future may publish research reports with respect to the dow chemical company which may or may not recommend that investors buy or hold the underlying stock     ■ the antidilution adjustments the calculation agent is required to make do not cover every corporate event that could affect the underlying stock barclays bank plc as calculation agent will adjust the amount payable at maturity for certain corporate events affecting the underlying stock such as stock splits and stock dividends and certain other corporate actions involving the issuer of the underlying stock such as mergers however the calculation agent will not make an adjustment for every corporate event that can affect the underlying stock for example the calculation agent is not required to make any adjustments if the issuer of the underlying stock or anyone else makes a partial tender or partial exchange offer for the underlying stock nor will adjustments be made following the final determination date if an event occurs that does not require the calculation agent to adjust the amount payable at maturity the market price of the securities may be materially and adversely affected     ■ the securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited there may be little or no secondary market for the securities we do not intend to list the securities on any securities exchange barclays capital inc and other affiliates of barclays bank plc intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time even if a secondary market develops it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities the price if any at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price if any at which barclays capital inc and other affiliates of barclays bank plc are willing to buy the securities accordingly you should be willing to hold your securities to maturity     ■ the inclusion of commissions and projected profit from hedging in the original issue price is likely to adversely affect secondary market prices assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors the price if any at which barclays capital inc and other affiliates of barclays bank plc is willing to purchase the securities in any secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the original issue price since the original issue price includes and secondary market prices are likely to exclude commissions paid with respect to the securities as well as the projected profit included in the cost of hedging the issuers obligations under the securities in addition any such prices may differ from values determined by pricing models used by barclays bank plc as a result of dealer discounts markups or other transaction costs and the price if any at which barclays capital inc and other affiliates of barclays bank plc will be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for the securities and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you     ■ hedging and trading activity by the calculation agent and its affiliates could potentially affect the value of the securities hedging or trading activities of the issuers affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities on or prior to the pricing date and prior to maturity could adversely affect the value of the underlying stock and as a result could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial share price and as a result the downside threshold level which is the price at or above which the underlying stock must close on each determination date in order for you to earn a contingent quarterly payment or if the securities are not called prior to maturity in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative price performance of the underlying stock at maturity additionally such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could potentially affect the price of the underlying stock on the determination dates and accordingly whether the securities are automatically called prior to maturity and if the securities are not called prior to maturity the payout to you at maturity     ■ the calculation agent will make determinations with respect to the securities as calculation agent among other things barclays bank plc will determine the initial share price the determination closing prices the downside threshold level the final share price whether the contingent quarterly payment will be paid on each contingent payment date whether the securities will be redeemed following any determination date whether a market disruption event has occurred whether to make any adjustments to the adjustment factor and the payment that you will receive upon an automatic early redemption or at maturity if any determinations made by barclays bank plc in its capacity as calculation agent including with respect to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of market disruption events may affect the payout to you upon an automatic early redemption or at maturity page        contingent income autocallable securities due august   based on the performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company           ■ potential conflicts we and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities including acting as calculation agent and hedging our obligations under the securities in performing these duties the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities     ■ higher contingent quarterly payments are generally associated with a greater risk of loss greater expected volatility with respect to the underlying stock reflects a higher expectation as of the pricing date that the price of the underlying stock could close below the downside threshold level on the valuation date of the securities this greater expected risk will generally be reflected in a higher contingent quarterly payment for that security however while the contingent quarterly payment is set on the pricing date the underlying stocks volatility may change significantly over the term of the securities the price of the underlying stock for your securities could fall sharply which could result in a significant loss of principal     ■ suitability of the securities for investment you should reach a decision to invest in the securities after carefully considering with your advisors the suitability of the securities in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement the prospectus supplement and the prospectus neither the issuer nor barclays capital inc makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the securities for investment     ■ in some circumstances the payment you receive on the securities may be based on the stock of another company and not the underlying stock following certain corporate events relating to the issuer of the underlying stock where the issuer is not the surviving entity your return on the securities paid by barclays bank plc may be based on the shares of a successor to the respective underlying stock issuer or any cash or any other assets distributed to holders of the underlying stock in such corporate event the occurrence of these corporate events and the consequent adjustments may materially and adversely affect the value of the securities for more information see the section reference assetsequity securitiesshare adjustments relating to securities with an equity security as the reference asset of the prospectus supplement     ■ the us federal income tax treatment of an investment in the securities is uncertain the us federal income tax treatment of the securities is uncertain and the internal revenue service could assert that the securities should be taxed in a manner that is different than described below as discussed further in the accompanying prospectus supplement the internal revenue service issued a notice in  indicating that it and the treasury department are actively considering whether among other issues you should be required to accrue interest over the term of an instrument such as the securities at a rate that may exceed the contingent quarterly payments if any that you receive on the securities and whether all or part of the gain you may recognize upon the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of an instrument such as the securities could be treated as ordinary income similarly the internal revenue service and the treasury department have current projects open with regard to the tax treatment of prepaid forward contracts contingent notional principal contracts and other derivative contracts while it is impossible to anticipate how any ultimate guidance would affect the tax treatment of instruments such as the securities and while any such guidance may be issued on a prospective basis only such guidance could be applied retroactively and could in any case i increase the likelihood that you will be required to accrue income even if you do not receive any payments with respect to the securities until early redemption or maturity and ii require you to accrue income in excess of any contingent quarterly payments received on the securities the outcome of this process is uncertain in addition any character mismatch arising from your inclusion of ordinary income in respect of the contingent quarterly payments and capital loss if any upon the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of your securities may result in adverse tax consequences to you because an investors ability to deduct capital losses is subject to significant limitations you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible alternative treatments in respect of the securities page        contingent income autocallable

holder as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement and you hold your securities as capital assets for tax purposes and does not apply to you if you are a member of a class of holders subject to special rules or are otherwise excluded from the discussion in the prospectus supplement for example if you did not purchase your securities in the initial issuance of the securities in addition this discussion does not apply to you if you purchase your securities for less than the principal amount of the securities         the united states federal income tax consequences of your investment in the securities are uncertain and the internal revenue service could assert that the securities should be taxed in a manner that is different than described below pursuant to the terms of the securities barclays bank plc and you agree in the absence of a change in law or an administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary to characterize your securities as a contingent income bearing executory contract with respect to the underlying stock         if your securities are properly treated as a contingent income bearing executory contract it would be reasonable i to treat any contingent quarterly payments you receive on the securities as items of ordinary income taxable in accordance with your regular method of accounting for us federal income tax purposes and ii to recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of your securities subject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of shares of the underlying stock at maturity in an amount equal to the difference if any between the amount you receive at such time other than amounts attributable to a contingent quarterly payment and your basis in the securities for us federal income tax purposes such gain or loss should generally be longterm capital gain or loss if you have held your securities for more than one year and otherwise should generally be shortterm capital gain or loss shortterm capital gains are generally subject to tax at the marginal tax rates applicable to ordinary income any character mismatch arising from your page        contingent income autocallable securities due august   based on the performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company                 inclusion of ordinary income in respect of the contingent quarterly payments and capital loss if any upon the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of your securities may result in adverse tax consequences to you because an investors ability to deduct capital losses is subject to significant limitations moreover in the event you receive shares of the underlying stock upon the maturity of the securities such loss may be deferred as described in the following paragraph               if you receive shares of the underlying stock upon the maturity of your securities it is not clear whether the receipt of shares of the underlying stock should be treated as i a taxable settlement of the securities followed by a purchase of the shares or ii a taxfree purchase of the shares pursuant to the original terms of the securities accordingly you should consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences to you of receiving shares of the underlying stock upon the maturity of your securities if the receipt of the shares is treated as a taxable settlement of the securities followed by a purchase of the shares you should i recognize capital loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares you receive at such time plus the cash received in lieu of a fractional share if any and your tax basis in the securities and ii take a basis in such shares in an amount equal to their fair market value at such time if alternatively the receipt of shares of the underlying stock upon the maturity of your securities is treated as a taxfree purchase of the shares i the receipt of shares of the underlying stock upon maturity of your securities should not give rise to the current recognition of gain or loss at such time ii you should take a carryover basis in such shares equal to the basis you had in your securities determined as described below less the basis attributable to a fractional share if any and iii if you receive cash in lieu of a fractional share upon the stock settlement of such securities you should recognize shortterm capital loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in the fractional share in general your tax basis in your securities will be equal to the price you paid for the securities your holding period in the shares you receive upon the maturity of your securities will begin on the day after you receive such shares         in the opinion of our special tax counsel sullivan  cromwell llp it would be reasonable to treat your securities in the manner described above this opinion assumes that the description of the terms of the securities in this pricing supplement is materially correct         no statutory judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how your securities should be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a result the us federal income tax consequences of your investment in the securities are uncertain accordingly we urge you to consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of investing in the securities         alternative treatments as discussed further in the accompanying prospectus supplement the treasury department and the internal revenue service are actively considering various alternative treatments that may apply to instruments such as the securities possibly with retroactive effect other alternative treatments for your securities may also be possible under current law for example it is possible that the securities could be treated as debt instruments subject to the special tax rules governing contingent payment debt instruments under the contingent payment obligations rules you generally would be required to accrue interest on a current basis in respect of the securities over their term based on the comparable yield and projected payment schedule for the securities and pay tax accordingly even though these amounts may exceed the contingent quarterly payments if any that are made on the securities this comparable yield and projected payment schedule are determined solely to calculate the amount on which you will be taxed prior to maturity and are neither a prediction nor a guarantee of what the actual yield and actual payments on the securities will be you would also be required to make adjustments to your accruals if the actual amounts that you receive in any taxable year differ from the amounts shown on the projected payment schedule in addition any gain you may recognize on the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of the securities would be taxed as ordinary interest income and any loss you may recognize on the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of the securities would generally be ordinary loss to the extent of the interest you previously included as income without an offsetting negative adjustment and thereafter would be capital loss you should consult your tax advisor as to the special rules that govern contingent payment debt instruments         it is also possible that your securities could be treated as an investment unit consisting of i a debt instrument that is issued to you by us and ii a put option in respect of the underlying stock that is issued by you to us for a discussion of the tax considerations applicable to this alternative treatment please see the discussion under the heading certain us federal income tax considerationscertain notes treated as deposits and put options in the accompanying prospectus supplement         in addition it is possible that i you should not include the contingent quarterly payments in income as you receive them and instead you should reduce your basis in your securities by the amount of the contingent quarterly payments that you receive ii you should not include the contingent quarterly payments in income as you receive them and instead upon the sale exchange early redemption or maturity of your securities you should recognize shortterm capital gain or loss in an amount equal to page        contingent income autocallable securities due august   based on the performance of the common stock of the dow chemical company           the difference between a the amount of the contingent quarterly payments paid to you over the term of the securities including the contingent quarterly payment received at early redemption or maturity or the amount of cash that you receive upon a sale that is attributable to the contingent quarterly payments to be paid on the securities and b the excess if any of  the amount you paid for your securities over  the amount of cash you receive upon the sale early redemption or maturity or iii if a contingent quarterly payment is paid at early redemption or maturity such contingent quarterly payment should not separately be taken into account as ordinary income but instead should increase the amount of capital gain or decrease the amount of capital loss that you recognize at early redemption or maturity         you should consult your tax advisor with respect to these possible alternative treatments         for a further discussion of the tax treatment of your securities as well as other possible alternative characterizations please see the discussion under the heading certain us federal income tax considerationscertain notes treated as forward contracts or executory contracts in the accompanying prospectus supplement you should consult your tax advisor
