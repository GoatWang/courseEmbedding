achieve harder stronger longerlasting erections and improve your sex drive updated  pm est mon may   tom stakleff senior researcher mens health and wellness i’ve probably said this to you before but i’ll say it again as the senior researcher for men’s health and wellness at supplement review digest my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements i want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better in regards to us men that means i have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive the inability to get and stay hard and the confusing male enhancement industry millions of men around the world are afflicted by agerelated issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection most of these men are between the ages of  and  like me there are various causes of our pain but the effects are all the same we feel guilty ashamed embarrassed and sexually frustrated there’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners today i’m going to help you find real solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives first it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault don’t be ashamed the challenge of getting a hard lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group you haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you will do something about it so keep your head up the struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life the next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market you’ve seen all the false claims out there every company says they have all the answers you could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry a quick bit of research on pubmed or even just wikipedia or webmd will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength so there must be some legitimate supplements out there the struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highlyconcentrated herbs backed by research and science and that other men use again and again because it works it’s no wonder i’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills i recommend some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill” i’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to you don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner i’m answering your calls for help today there are effective male enhancement supplements out there and i’m going to help you find them you can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health best of all you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve the science of erections you probably already know this by now but i’m going to rehash it just in case there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect the full process is a little bit more complicated than that but that’s the important part so to find an effective supplement you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled there are several factors that can complicate this process some of the factors are mental depression stress anxiety some are physical circulation hormones diabetes a good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive how to spot a scam these are my top  red flags i use to avoid throwing money away  prescription strength this might be obvious but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness if a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run sidebyside with a prescription drug immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide  free trial when a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info the subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel so whether the product works or not you’re stuck paying for it again and again  the product promises to add inches to your member as i mentioned before every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection those chambers determine the size of an erect penis aside from surgery there is no way to change the size of those chambers there is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth some supplements will claim to “maximize size” that’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers  if the website looks amateur this one is probably obvious if the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over be warned if a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer how can they afford to develop an effective supplement  if it’s not made in america foreignmade products are not subject to fda scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time some of these supplements may do more harm than good how to spot a lifechanger there are multiple ways to identify a good product i reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article for now here’s a general rule rather than look at the ingredients in the product look at the research behind the ingredients don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework or that won’t show it to you a credible company will share their research with you you know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide they will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results harder longerlasting erections improved sex drive maximized size boosted mood  confidence satisfied partners more intimate love life sexual satisfaction how we rated our winners now that i have helped you avoid the time and money wasters it’s time to fill you in on how my search for effective supplements went the male enhancement market is huge my research team and i sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there i’m

our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects as you

many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web if there is one thing we don’t like its companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade and effective ed supplements as it turns out many brands use their existing reputation and marketingbudgets to sell you medium quality products even worse some put dangerous fillers such as hydrogenated oils and titanium dioxide on the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies at first it may seem counterintuitive that big brands would sell a low quality product or that a product would be on the market without result tests

zschau i had an awful lot to learn about business    i had the conglomerate mentality  the view that if you just build one product for one market you werent going to be too successful after i got into five different businesses and almost went bankrupt several times i learned that you have to focus on something by tom richman write a comment credit eventually ed zschau wants to run a diner in some college town where he can serve up greasy hamburgers and talk philosophy with hirsute students what is more likely however is that he will own the diner maybe a whole chain of them or that he will be teaching philosophy at the college probably as head of the department zschau is a person  we all know one or two of them  whose biggest problem seems to be coping with an excess of successit is in fact a problem that has dogged him since his college days at princeton university where he managed to earn a degree with not one but three undergraduate majors  math physics and philosophy he went to stanford university to study business and got not only an mba but also a phd when he taught it was at the graduate business schools at both harvard university and stanford and when he started his owr business system industries inc it soon became americas largest independent supplier of minicomputer memory systems last year he won a california congressional seat in his first run for political office he is young  and goodlookingif he werent so pleasant ed zschau would be easy to dislike instead he seems to win new admirers wherever he goes according to rep james leach of iowa  a fellow republican and princeton alumnus  ed zschau is the star of our freshman class his constituents too give his sometimes maverick views a respect seldom accorded neophyte politiciansim one whos trying to throw cold water on the idea that high technology is the answer to all the countrys problems he tells a group of silicon valley executives who nod their agreementof course government has a role to play in business he tells some hardnosed businessmen who show no sign of wanting to arguethe  personal income tax cuts were a big mistake and social security payments should not be fully indexed to inflation he says one evening before a town meeting of district voters prosperous enough to be paying income taxes and old enough to be drawing social security checks none of them flincheszschau may not be the only businessperson or even the only entrepreneur in the us house of representatives but he is hardly typical in a body dominated by lawyers and former state legislators the founder and former chief executive officer of a highly successful hightech company he represents a congressional district  californias th which includes santa clara valley  with more technologybased companies and entrepreneurs than any other district in the country to breastbeating freemarket republicans and to democrats who would turn the countrys economic future over to a government planning board alike he can say that he has lived in that part of the real world and that it doesnt work the way either one of them wishes it didoddly enough zschau had no intention of becoming either a businessman or a politician when he started out a nebraskan by birth and a scholar by training he appeared destined for a career in academe after earning his phd in business from stanford in  he taught for a year at harvard business school then returned to palo alto fully expecting to continue his studies another professor and i were asked to head up the businesspolicy program at stanford he recalls which deals with strategic planning and how to be a ceo we got started and frankly i guess i felt a need to get into business myself to see whether i could run a business and how it all workedthe particular business that i decided to start was sort of an accident i ran into a friend who had recently started a company in the scientific instrument business and his firm needed a computer system to automate the instrument so that was the first product that my company developed it wasnt a very successful product but successful enough to get us goingi had an awful lot to learn for example i learned about focus when i was studying for my mba and phd a lot of business professors and business leaders were enamored of the concept of conglomerates i had a lot of that mentality  the view that if you just build one product for one market you werent going to be too successful after i got into five different businesses and almost went bankrupt several times i learned that you have to focus on something  a product or a product line and a market  and devote all of your attention to that one by one we began to sell product lines off and the one business that a lot of people thought would never survive  the storage systems business  is now running at a  million annual sales rateas an entrepreneur zschau gave little thought to politics but in  he agreed to head a task force of the american electronics association that was seeking a reduction in the maximum capitalgains tax rate from  to  working with other organizations he lobbied the legislation through congress over the strong opposition of thenpresident jimmy carter who wanted the tax rate increasedhaving seen the impact that people who understood the issue could have on the legislative process zschau relates i got more interested in politics when congressman pete mccloskey decided to run for the senate leaving his seat open i thought about what i would do and decided that i had a contribution to make the company was reaching  million or  million in sales about the right time to transfer to professional management from the raw entrepreneur everything just fell into placezschau turned out to be a firstrate campaigner and he still maintains a campaign pace when he is in his district one day last august for example he managed a lunchtime address to the electronics association of california in santa clara a field hearing of a house subcommittee in berkeley and a meeting with constituents in menlo parkthe electronics executives greeted him as one of their own and zschau spoke to them out of shared experience telling stories about his own company the thing about my venture capitalists was that although their pockets might have been deep their arms were real short he quipped     i used to have this professor who said that you couldnt know what it was to be in business until youd met a payroll i say you dont know what its like to be in small business until youve missed one one diner confided to his tablemate that zschau is somebody who understands business and cant be snowedthen again he is wise enough to admit the limits of his knowledge i dont know he said to a questioner at a meeting that same evening you may be right i hadnt thought of it that way perhaps i should he applies the same rule to politics that he learned in business concentrate in areas in which you have strength you earn influence he says by developing a reputation for being thoughtful and well informed on certain issues and for speaking only when you have something to saymost of what zschau has said since entering the house this year relates to the federal governments role in influencing  for better or for worse  industrys ability to compete in international markets and at homehis premise is simple americas strong suit is innovation the creation of new technologies products services and companies consequently the best thing government can do is to promote an environment that encourages innovation instead of picking industrial winners and losers and targeting them for special help as many have suggested the government must target the innovation process itself what he means by this is that innovation  whether in high technology or in basic industries  occurs when certain conditions exist namely when there are educated people working with a sound research base in a healthy economy providing incentives to risktakers the federal government he says should work to foster these conditions he believes for example that government has primary responsibility for the funding of basic as opposed to applied research at universities he also believes that industry would perform more of its own research if antitrust laws did not dampen enthusiasm for joint research efforts in addition the federal government can use tax incentives to encourage privatesector assistance in funding education that benefits specific industriestax policy can likewise affect the willingness of individuals and companies to take risks he says democrats complain that rich people shouldnt get tax breaks but when you eliminate tax breaks you dry up risk capital there should be a preception that the tax system is fair but when someone who has nothing creates something we shouldnt say thats wrong theyve created wealth jobs we ought to be telling these people good going attaboyon the other hand zschau has long opposed acrosstheboard individual income tax cuts including those of  which he predicted would be a factor in increasing the federal deficit thereby making it harder to bring interest rates down and hindering investment i continue to believe that he asserts on the spending side he argues for a social compact in which all the special interests agree that reducing the deficit will benefit them more than their special programall of which may sound a little too neat and tidy buti dont purport to have the whole answer zschau admits my industrialpolicy suggestions so far have focused on maintaining our technological leadership and  an extension of that  making our tired industries more competitive through the application of technology but i dont purport to have solutions to any transitional problems that may arise im not sure i understand or anyone understands how severe they are or what their causes are i have a fairly narrow range of experience ive been in the hightech industry and i think that by and large the business attitudes in that industry are unique people there are rugged individualists very much dedicated to free enterprise free trade risktaking its a breed of businessman that is a fine example of capitalism at work ive gotten a very positive view of the social responsibilities of business and where jobs are created and what kinds of management attitudes work had i been employed in some monolith headquartered in new york city i may have gotten a somewhat different view of the way business works mine was sort of a smallcompany entrepreneurial perspectivezschau insists that as usual he has given little thought to his future thats been my approach all along as time goes on other opportunities arise and i find myself in the shower in the morning thinking more about the new thing than the old thing when that begins to occur more frequently i tell myself its time to make a change im no longer  intrigued by what im doing it would be better for someone else to do that job and ill move along to something thats really sparked my interest published on dec   ed zschau edzschau  twitter skip to content home home home current page about search query search twitter searches

startup product leaders – ed zschau – mediumhomepagesign in  sign uped zschaublockedunblockfollowfollowingretained search for product and marketing execs at inductus associates father of two nba warriors fanjun  five traits of startup product leadersproduct leaders come in all flavors startups succeed by shipping great products and great products come from having the right person leading the product in a startup the product leader is often a company founder — the ceo a founding vp product the cto or a mix of cofoundersthe product leader shapes the norms and priorities on product in these formative stages how the company thinks about product how product is discussed internally how user feedback is acquired and processed what quantifiable data is obtained and weighed and how product decisions are made are all directed by the person leading productas the company changes and grows the product leadership needs to evolve sometimes the individual leading product adapts and sometimes a new leader needs to take over the successful startup has someone who can adapt her product leadership to match the company’s needs or the successful startup is able to make the personnel change with minimal impact on building the productin recruiting product leaders for venture backed startups i’ve learned that good product leaders possess five characteristics that i’ll describe as the innovator the executioner the influencer the analyzer and the business owner a product leader is not singularly one of these types but a collection of all five where one or two traits may be stronger than the othersthe innovator — she is creative and visionary she listens intently and frequently to user needs but sees the product used in ways beyond how users behave and the needs they describe she loves discussing ideas holding brainstorming sessions with employees and customers and is constantly thinking about ways to evolve the product she constantly asks questions tests concepts and gathers data and opinions from customers analysts and experts on product ideas she spends a lot of time talking to customers about solving their needs but also pays attention to market trends technology developments competitor products and other queues for inspiration“the innovator sets a compelling product vision and constantly evaluates ideas against that vision”the executioner — she drives outcomes and results she pays close attention to details she’s motivated by achieving goals meeting deadlines and hitting milestones she applies process to guide the team’s execution but does not over apply it she rigorously applies product development methods like iterative design agile scrum and lean startup concepts to build product she build respect with her team and with engineering by meeting expectations being accountable and staying focused and organized she studies bestpractice product management methods and applies them as appropriate in developing the product“the executioner sets the goals timetables practices and expectations to drive the company to a shipped product”the influencer — she is a gifted listener communicator negotiator and relationship builder she knows the product stakeholders understands their motivations goals resources and constraints she takes into account her stakeholders’ needs but also knows how to acquire their commitment and resources to move the product forward she comes to product decisions through direct giveandtake feedback and sets product direction through gaining buy off and commitments from her product and design teams and from key players throughout the company she is skilled to involve the product team key functional stakeholders customers partners and industry influencers in the product creation process“the influencer marshals the resources and aligns the company towards a main product direction”the analyzer — she relies heavily on user information research and data to make product decisions she sets metrics and measures product performance based upon customer behavior she applies analytical frameworks and tools — like ab testing cohort analysis — to draw insights from the customer data she is a big believer in usability testing and collaborates with design and engineering to test measure and evaluate new features she pays close attention to the tradeoffs and dependencies among functionality user experience and technology capability and coaches his product team to do the same“the analyzer applies the right metrics and interprets the data to make good product choices”the business owner — she thinks of product as a business she knows the company’s business and financial goals intimately and aligns her product objectives to them she builds the business case for the product quantifies risk factors and calculates the financial outcomes for building the product she is crack at financial analysis and incorporates financial metrics eg cpa lcv arpu to make product decisions and evaluate product performance she tests business models sizes markets builds pricing scenarios calculates margins determines capital requirements and builds bottomsup budget plans she studies her competitors incessantly and strives to beat competitors to win the market“the business owner evaluates the financial opportunity and required investment to build launch and market the product”a great product leader recognizes her one or two strong traits and either works to build up those traits or hires people who are already strong in those areas it’s the ceo job to ensure that the individual leading product shows up every day exhibiting these traits to build the company’s productthanks to will aldrich waldrich gary swart garyswart and andy chen andychen for commenting on earlier versions of this

reviews and ratings true male enhancement supplements revealed how you really can achieve harder stronger longerlasting erections and improve your sex drive updated  pm est mon may   tom stakleff senior researcher mens health and wellness i’ve probably said this to you before but i’ll say it again as the senior researcher for men’s health and wellness at supplement review digest my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements i want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better in regards to us men that means i have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive the inability to get and stay hard and the confusing male enhancement industry millions of men around the world are afflicted by agerelated issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection most of these men are between the ages of  and  like me there are various causes of our pain but the effects are all the same we feel guilty ashamed embarrassed and sexually frustrated there’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners today i’m going to help you find real solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives first it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault don’t be ashamed the challenge of getting a hard lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group you haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you will do something about it so keep your head up the struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life the next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market you’ve seen all the false claims out there every company says they have all the answers you could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry a quick bit of research on pubmed or even just wikipedia or webmd will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength so there must be some legitimate supplements out there the struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highlyconcentrated herbs backed by research and science and that other men use again and again because it works it’s no wonder i’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills i recommend some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill” i’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to you don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner i’m answering your calls for help today there are effective male enhancement supplements out there and i’m going to help you find them you can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health best of all you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve the science of erections you probably already know this by now but i’m going to rehash it just in case there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect the full process is a little bit more complicated than that but that’s the important part so to find an effective supplement you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled there are several factors that can complicate this process some of the factors are mental depression stress anxiety some are physical circulation hormones diabetes a good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive how to spot a scam these are my top  red flags i use to avoid throwing money away  prescription strength this might be obvious but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness if a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run sidebyside with a prescription drug immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide  free trial when a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info the subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel so whether the product works or not you’re stuck paying for it again and again  the product promises to add inches to your member as i mentioned before every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection those chambers determine the size of an erect penis aside from surgery there is no way to change the size of those chambers there is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth some supplements will claim to “maximize size” that’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers  if the website looks amateur this one is probably obvious if the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over be warned if a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer how can they afford to develop an effective supplement  if it’s not made in america foreignmade products are not subject to fda scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time some of these supplements may do more harm than good how to spot a lifechanger there are multiple ways to identify a good product i reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article for now here’s a general rule rather than look at the ingredients in the product look at the research behind the ingredients don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework or that won’t show it to you a credible company will share their research with you you know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide they will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results harder longerlasting erections improved sex drive maximized size boosted mood  confidence satisfied partners more intimate love life sexual satisfaction how we
