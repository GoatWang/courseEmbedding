each subadviser will manage the investment and reinvestment of each fund’s or its respective master fund’s assets in accordance with the fund’s investment objective any subadviser to a fund or its respective master fund will either be registered under the advisers act or will not be required to register thereunder c the distributor the trust will enter into a distribution agreement with one or more distributors each distributor will be a broker registered under the exchange act and will act as distributor and principal underwriter “ distributor ” of one or more of the funds  each distributor will distribute creation units of the shares on an agency basis no distributor is or will be affiliated with any exchange the distributor for each fund will  comply with the terms and conditions of this application the distributor of any one fund may be an “affiliated person” or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of that fund’s adviser andor subadvisers d underlying indexes and licensing arrangements the initial fund is and any future fund will be entitled to use its underlying index pursuant to either a licensing agreement with the entity that compiles creates sponsors or maintains an underlying index each an “ index provider ” or a sublicensing arrangement  with the adviser which has or will have a licensing agreement with such index provider except with respect to the selfindexing funds no index provider is or will be an “affiliated person” as defined in section a of the act or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the trust or a fund of the adviser of any sub adviser to or promoter of a fund or of the distributor the licenses for the selfindexing funds will specifically state that the applicable affiliated index provider or in case of a sublicensing agreement the adviser must provide the use of the affiliated indexes and related intellectual property at no cost to the trust and the selfindexing funds e special considerations applicable to selfindexing funds in the case of selfindexing funds an “affiliated person” as defined in section a of the act or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the trust or a fund of the adviser of any subadviser to or promoter of a fund or of the distributor the “ affiliated index provider ” will create a proprietary rules based methodology described below “ rules based process ” to create underlying indexes each an “ affiliated index ” and collectively the “ affiliated indexes ”  the portfolios of the selfindexing funds will be fully “transparent” meaning that each selfindexing fund will post on its website “ website ” on each day that the nyse the relevant listing exchange and the trust are open for business and includes any day that a fund is required to be open under section e of the act a “ business day ” before commencement of trading of shares on the exchange the identities and quantities of the portfolio holdings held by the fund or its respective master fund that will form the basis for the fund’s calculation of nav at the end of the business day  applicants believe that the disclosure of portfolio holdings would be unlikely to lead to “front running” where other persons would trade ahead of the fund and the investors assembling the deposit instruments as defined below for purchases of creation units anymore than is the case with the etfs now trading similarly applicants assert that the frequent disclosures of portfolio holdings would not lead to “free riding” where other persons mirror the fund’s investment strategies without paying the fund’s advisory fees any more than such disclosures cause this problem in connection with the etfs now trading applicants recognize that selfindexing funds could raise concerns regarding the potential ability of an affiliated person to manipulate the underlying index to the benefit or detriment of the selfindexing fund applicants further recognize the potential for conflicts that may arise with respect to the personal trading activity of personnel of the affiliated person who may have access to or knowledge of changes to an underlying index’s composition methodology or the constituent securities in an underlying index prior to the time that information is publicly disseminated applicants believe that existing protections under the act and the advisers act will help to mitigate these potential conflicts of interest as discussed below and that requiring selfindexing funds to maintain full portfolio transparency will also provide an effective additional mechanism for addressing these potential conflicts of interest applicants do not believe the potential for conflicts of interest raised by an adviser’s use of the underlying indexes in connection with the management of the self indexing funds and the affiliated accounts will be substantially different from the potential conflicts presented by an adviser managing two or more registered funds more specifically applicants do not believe the potential for conflicts presented by an adviser’s use of the underlying indexes in connection with the management of the funds and the affiliated  accounts is substantially different from the potential for conflicts presented by the side by side management of etfs that track the performance of an index that also serves as the benchmark for a traditional mutual fund or unregistered account managed by the same adviser as discussed below both the act and the advisers act contain various protections to address conflicts of interest where an adviser is managing two or more registered funds and these protections will also help address these conflicts with respect to the selfindexing funds the adviser and any subadviser has adopted or will adopt pursuant to rule  under the advisers act written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the advisers act and the rules thereunder these include policies and procedures designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest among the selfindexing funds and the affiliated accounts such as cross trading policies as well as those designed to ensure the equitable allocation of portfolio transactions and brokerage commissions  in addition the initial adviser has adopted or will adopt policies and procedures as required under section a of the advisers act which are reasonably designed in light of the nature of its business to prevent the misuse in violation of the advisers act or the exchange act or the rules thereunder of material non public information by the initial adviser or associated person “ inside information policy ” any other adviser andor sub adviser will be required to adopt and maintain a similar inside information policy in accordance with the code of ethics discussed below and inside information policy of the adviser and subadvisers personnel of those entities with knowledge about the composition of a portfolio deposit as defined below will be prohibited from disclosing such information to any other person except as authorized in the course of their employment until such information is made public the trust will execute confidentiality agreements with any of its service providers who are provided information on the portfolio deposit the structure of the selfindexing funds as well as those of the affiliated accounts as index funds minimizes the potential for conflicts as the investment strategies of each selfindexing fund and the affiliated accounts will be constrained by its objective to track the performance of its underlying index before fees and expenses the portfolio managers responsible for daytoday portfolio management of the selfindexing funds and affiliated accounts will be employees of the adviser or a subadviser the personnel responsible for overseeing the activities of any subadviser in connection with the management of the selfindexing funds and affiliated accounts will be employees of the adviser the initial adviser has adopted or will adopt and any other adviser has adopted or will adopt a code of ethics pursuant to rule j under the act and rule a under the advisers act which contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent access persons as defined in rule j from engaging in any conduct prohibited in rule j “ code of ethics ” any subadviser will be required to confirm to the adviser and trust that it has adopted policies and procedures to monitor and restrict securities trading by certain employees also any subadviser will be required to adopt a code of ethics pursuant to rule j under the act and rule a under the advisers act and to provide the trust with the certification required by rule j under the act neither the adviser nor any subadviser will receive incentive fees for outperforming the underlying index of any selfindexing fund or affiliated account in fact any material outperformance or underperformance would be viewed negatively by investors of such investments to the extent the selfindexing funds transact with an affiliated person of the adviser or subadviser such transactions will comply with the act the rules thereunder and the terms and conditions of the order each selfindexing fund’s board will periodically review the selfindexing fund’s use of an affiliated index provider subject to the approval of the selfindexing funds’ board the adviser affiliated persons of the adviser “ adviser affiliates ” and those of any sub adviser “ subadviser affiliates ” may be authorized to provide custody fund accounting and administration and transfer agency services to the selfindexing funds any services provided by the adviser adviser affiliates subadviser and sub adviser affiliates will be performed in accordance with the provisions of the act the rules under the act and any relevant guidelines from the staff of the commission  finally as noted above applicants in the prior orders received relief to operate selfindexing funds on the basis of daily portfolio transparency as discussed above see for example the discussion at section iif in the guggenheim application supra note  f capital structure and voting rights bookentry shareholders of a fund will have one vote per share or per dollar with respect to matters regarding the fund for which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the act the rules promulgated thereunder and state law applicable to delaware statutory trusts shares will be registered in bookentry form only the funds will not issue individual share certificates the depository trust company new york new york a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the state of new york the “ depository ”   or  “ dtc ” or its nominee will be the record or registered owner of all outstanding shares beneficial ownership of shares owners of such beneficial interests referred to herein as “ beneficial owners ” will be shown on the records of the depository or the depository participants the “ dtc participants ” beneficial owners of shares will exercise their rights in such securities indirectly through the depository and dtc participants all references herein to owners or holders of such shares shall reflect the rights of persons holding an interest in such securities as they may indirectly exercise such rights through the depository and dtc participants except as otherwise specified no beneficial owner shall have the right to receive a certificate representing such shares delivery of all notices statements shareholder reports and other communications from any fund to its beneficial owners will be at such fund’s or adviser’s expense through the customary practices and facilities of the depository and dtc participants g investment objectives and policies  general the investment objective of each fund will be to provide investment results that closely correspond before fees and expenses to the performance of its underlying index in seeking to achieve the investment objective of a fund the adviser andor subadviser will utilize the indexing investment approaches described below a feeder fund will pursue its investment objective by investing in a master fund with an identical investment objective applicants have designed this “masterfeeder” structure because it is anticipated that in addition to the funds other feeder funds will be created in the future and hold shares of each respective master fund such other feeder funds could be traditional mutual funds the shares of which would be individually redeemable other etfs or other pooled investment vehicles creating an exchangetraded feeder fund may be preferable to creating entirely new series which could create additional overhead costs  while certain costs may be higher in a masterfeeder structure and there may possibly be lower tax efficiencies for the feeder funds the feeder funds’ board will consider any such potential disadvantages against the benefits of operating within a masterfeeder structure each fund or its respective master fund will consist of a portfolio of securities and other assets and positions each fund or its respective master fund will invest at least  of its assets exclusive of collateral held from securities lending in component securities of its respective underlying index or in the case of fixed income funds in the component securities of its respective underlying index and tba transactions  representing component securities and in the case of foreign funds in component securities and depositary receipts representing foreign securities such as american depositary receipts “ adrs ” and global depositary receipts “ gdrs ” “ depositary receipts ” representing such component securities or in the case of foreign funds tracking underlying indexes for which depositary receipts are themselves component securities underlying stocks in respect of such depositary receipts  any depositary receipts held by a foreign fund or its respective master fund will be negotiable securities that represent ownership of a nonus  company’s publicly traded stock applicants believe that in certain cases holding one or more depositary receipts rather than the component securities of the relevant foreign index will improve the liquidity tradability and settlement of a foreign fund’s then current portfolio deposit as defined below thereby improving the efficiency of the creation and redemption process and facilitating efficient arbitrage activity while at the same time permitting a foreign fund or its respective master fund to maintain direct exposure to component securities of its foreign index each fund or its respective master fund may also invest up to  of its assets “  asset basket ” in certain index futures options options on index futures swap contracts or other derivatives “ financial instruments ” as related to its respective underlying index and its component securities cash and cash equivalents other investment companies as well as in securities and other instruments not included in its underlying index but which the adviser believes will help the fund or its respective master fund track its underlying index a fund may also engage in short sales in accordance with its investment objective  a fund will utilize either a “replication strategy” or “representative sampling” as described below a fund using a “replication strategy” will invest in the component securities in its underlying index in the same approximate proportions as in the underlying index a fund utilizing representative sampling will hold some but not necessarily all of the component securities of its underlying index from time to time adjustments will be made in the portfolio of each fund or its respective master fund in accordance with changes in the composition of the underlying index or if applicable to maintain ric compliance applicants expect that the returns of each fund or its respective master fund will have an annual tracking error of less than  relative to its underlying index a fund may utilize a representative sampling strategy with respect to its underlying index when a replication strategy might be detrimental to its beneficial owners such as when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities to follow its underlying index which contains component securities too numerous to efficiently purchase or sell or in certain instances when a component security becomes temporarily illiquid unavailable or less liquid a fund using representative sampling will invest in what it believes to be a representative sample of the component securities in the underlying index which will be selected by the adviser andor subadviser utilizing quantitative analytical procedures under the representative sampling technique each security is selected for inclusion in a fund through the adviser’s or the subadviser’s application of quantitative analytical procedures to give the fund’s portfolio an investment profile similar to that of its underlying index if the representative sampling technique is used a fund may not track the performance of its underlying index with the same degree of accuracy as would an investment vehicle that invested in every component security of the underlying index with the same weighting as the underlying index the applicable adviser andor subadviser may also use representative sampling to exclude less liquid component securities contained in the underlying index from a fund’s portfolio in order to create a more tradable portfolio and improve arbitrage opportunities finally the fund may realize savings in transaction costs or other efficiencies by gaining exposure to the return of an underlying index through the use of securities or instruments in its  asset basket  depositary receipts the funds or their respective master funds may invest in depositary receipts representing foreign securities in which they seek to invest depositary receipts are typically issued by a financial institution a “ depositary bank ” and evidence ownership interests in a security or a pool of securities “ underlying securities ” that have been deposited with the depositary bank  a fund or its respective master fund will not invest in any depositary receipts that the adviser or any subadviser deems to be illiquid or for which pricing information is not readily available   longshort funds underlying indexes that include both long and short positions in securities are referred to as “ longshort indexes ”   the longshort indexes will employ a rulesbased approach to determine the component securities and the weightings of the component securities in the long portion and the short portion of the longshort index the longshort indexes will have a welldeveloped specified methodology and have fully transparent component securities and weightings each longshort index will be a domestic index foreign index or combination thereof each longshort fund will establish i exposures equal to approximately  of the long positions specified by the longshort index and ii exposures equal to approximately  of the short positions specified by the longshort index the net investment exposure of each of the longshort funds will equal its net assets with respect to a longshort fund’s long position each fund or its respective master fund expects to hold long positions in component securities from the long portion of the longshort index with respect to a longshort fund’s short position each fund or its respective master fund expects to hold short positions in component securities from the short portion “ short positions ” of the longshort index each longshort fund will invest at least  of its total assets in the component securities including depositary receipts and tba transactions including short positions of the longshort index  the remainder of each longshort fund’s assets will be its  asset basket and may be invested as described above to the extent required by section f of the act portfolio holdings and cash in a longshort fund’s portfolio would be segregated to cover short positions and financial instruments in the portfolio    funds underlying indexes that use a  investment strategy are referred to as “  indexes ”   the  indexes will employ a rulesbased approach to determine the component securities and the weightings of the component securities in the long portion and the short portion of the index the  indexes will have a welldeveloped specified methodology and have fully transparent component securities and weightings each  index will be a domestic index or foreign index or combination thereof each  fund will establish i exposures to long positions in component securities equal in value to approximately  of total net assets and ii exposures to short positions in component securities equal in value to approximately  of total net assets as specified by the underlying  index the net investment exposure of each of the  funds will equal its net assets with respect to a  fund’s long position each fund or its respective master fund expects to hold long positions in component securities from the long portion of the  index with respect to a  fund’s short position each fund or its respective master fund expects to hold short positions each domestic  fund will hold at least  of its total assets in component securities that are specified for the long positions and short positions in its underlying domestic  index  it would then invest the remainder of its assets in component securities noncomponent securities or securities or instruments in its  asset basket as deemed appropriate by the adviser to track the domestic  index to the extent required by section f of the act and the regulations thereunder portfolio holdings and cash in a  fund’s portfolio would be segregated to cover short positions and financial instruments in the portfolio foreign  funds will invest at least  of their total assets in component securities that are specified for the long positions and short positions in their foreign  indexes or depositary receipts representing component securities that are specified for the long and short positions in their foreign   indexes fixed income  funds will invest at least  of their total assets in component securities that are specified for the long positions and short positions in their fixed income  indexes or tba transactions representing component securities that are specified for the long positions and short positions in their fixed income  indexes the full portfolio holdings of each longshort fund and each  fund will be made publicly available on the fund’s website on each business day before commencement of trading of shares on the exchange given the website disclosure anyone will be able to know in real time the intraday value of the longshort and  funds with respect to longshort and  funds the investment characteristics of any short positions used to achieve short and long exposures will be described in sufficient detail for market participants to understand the principal investment strategies of the funds and to permit informed trading of their shares applicants believe that the disclosure of portfolio holdings would be unlikely to lead to “front running” any more than is the case with the etfs now trading similarly applicants assert that the frequent disclosures of portfolio holdings would not lead to “free riding” where other persons mirror the fund’s investment strategies without paying the fund’s advisory fees any more than such disclosures cause this problem in connection with the etfs now trading h exchange listing the shares of each fund will be listed on a listing exchange the trust will submit an application to list the shares of any future fund on an exchange the distributor will serve as principal underwriter only of the creation units of shares and will not maintain a secondary market in shares it is expected that one or more exchange member firms will be designated by the listing exchange to act as market makers in shares shares of each fund will be traded on an exchange in a manner similar to that of other etfs as long as each fund operates in reliance on the requested order shares will be listed on a listing exchange shares may also be crosslisted on one or more foreign securities markets i sales of shares  general the trust will be structured in a manner similar to etfs currently trading in the united states and therefore will offer issue and sell shares of each fund to investors only in creation units through the distributor on a continuous basis at the nav per share next determined after an order in proper form is received the nav of each fund is expected to be determined as of the close of the regular trading session on the nyse ordinarily  pm eastern time “ et ” “ closing time ” on each day that the nyse is open each fund will sell and redeem creation units only on a business day  purchase and redemption of creation units in order to keep costs low and potentially permit closer tracking of each fund’s underlying index shares will be purchased and redeemed in creation units and generally on an inkind basis accordingly except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified below purchasers will be required to purchase creation units by making an inkind deposit of specified instruments “ deposit instruments ” and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive an inkind transfer of specified instruments “ redemption instruments ”  on any given business day the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the deposit instruments and the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the redemption instruments will be identical unless the fund is rebalancing as defined below in addition the deposit instruments and the  redemption instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the fund’s portfolio including cash positions  except a in the case of bonds for minor differences when it is impossible to break up bonds beyond certain minimum sizes needed for transfer and settlement b for minor differences when rounding is necessary to eliminate fractional shares or lots that are not tradeable round lots  c tba transactions short positions derivatives and other positions that cannot be transferred in kind  will be excluded from the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments  d to the extent the fund determines on a given business day to use a representative sampling of the fund’s portfolio  or e for temporary periods to effect changes in the fund’s portfolio as a result of the rebalancing of its underlying index any such change a “ rebalancing ” if there is a difference between the net asset value attributable to a creation unit and the aggregate market value of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments exchanged for the creation unit the party conveying instruments with the lower value will also pay to the other an amount in cash equal to that difference the “ cash amount ” a difference may occur where the market value of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments as applicable changes relative to the net asset value of the fund for the reasons identified in clauses a through e above purchases and redemptions of creation units may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis rather than in kind solely under the following circumstances a to the extent there is a cash amount as described above b if on a given business day the fund announces before the open of trading that all purchases all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash c if upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an authorized participant the fund determines to require the purchase or redemption as applicable to be made entirely in cash  d if on a given business day the fund requires all authorized participants purchasing or redeeming shares on that day to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are not eligible for transfer either through the national securities clearing corporation “ nscc ” a clearing agency registered with the commission or dtc or ii in the case of foreign funds holding nonus investments such instruments are not eligible for trading due to local trading restrictions local restrictions on securities transfers or other similar circumstances or e if the fund permits an authorized participant to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are in the case of the purchase of a creation unit not available in sufficient quantity ii such instruments are not eligible for trading by an authorized participant or the investor on whose behalf the authorized participant is acting or iii a holder of shares of a foreign fund holding nonus investments would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind  each business day before the open of trading on the listing exchange the fund will cause to be published through the nscc the names and quantities of the instruments comprising the deposit instruments  and the redemption instruments as well as the estimated cash amount if any for that day  the list of deposit instruments and redemption instruments will apply until a new list is announced on the following business day and there will be no intraday changes to the list except to correct errors in the published list  transaction fees transaction expenses including operational processing and brokerage costs will be incurred by a fund when investors purchase or redeem creation units “inkind” and such costs have the potential to dilute the interests of the fund’s existing shareholders  hence each fund will impose purchase or redemption transaction fees “ transaction fees ” in connection with effecting such purchases or redemptions of creation units since the transaction fees are intended to defray the transaction expenses as well as to prevent possible shareholder dilution resulting from the purchase or redemption of creation units the transaction fees will be borne only by such purchasers or redeemers where a fund permits an “inkind” purchaser to substitute cash in lieu of depositing one or more of the requisite deposit instruments the purchaser may be assessed a higher transaction fee on the cash in lieu portion of its investment to cover the cost of purchasing such deposit instruments including operational processing and brokerage costs and part or all of the spread between the expected bid and offer side of the market relating to such deposit instruments the amounts of such transaction fees will be determined separately for each fund the amount of the maximum transaction fee for each fund will be set separately as discussed above variations in the transaction fee may be imposed from time to time transaction fees will be limited to amounts that have been determined by the adviser to be appropriate and will take into account transaction costs associated with the relevant deposit instruments and redemption instruments of the funds in all cases such transaction fees will be limited in accordance with requirements of the commission applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities          purchase of creation units general all orders to purchase shares of a fund in creation units must be placed with the distributor by or through an “ authorized participant ”   which is either  a “ participating party ”   ie a brokerdealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement “ cns ” system of the nscc or  a participant in dtc which in either case has signed a “ participant agreement ”   with the distributor an authorized participant is not required to be a member of an exchange the distributor will be responsible for transmitting the orders to the funds and will furnish to those placing such orders confirmation that the orders for creation units have been accepted but the distributor may reject any order which is not submitted in proper form in accordance with the terms of the participant agreement subsequent to the acceptance of an order to purchase shares in creation units upon delivery of the requisite deposit instruments and cash amount if any the distributor will instruct the applicable fund to initiate “delivery” of the appropriate number of shares of the applicable fund to the bookentry account specified by the entity placing the order the distributor also will be responsible for delivering the fund’s prospectus to those authorized participants purchasing shares in creation units and for maintaining records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it in addition the distributor will maintain a record of the instructions given to the applicable fund to implement the delivery of its shares an investor does not have to be an authorized participant but must place an order through and make appropriate arrangements with an authorized participant authorized participants making payment for creation units of shares of any domestic equity fund placed through the distributor must either  initiate instructions pertaining to portfolio deposits through the cns system as such processes have been enhanced to effect purchases and redemptions of creation units of shares such process being referred to herein as the “ nscc clearing process ” or  deposit portfolio deposits with the fund “outside” the nscc clearing process through the facilities of dtc “ dtc facilities ”   placement and acceptance of creation unit purchase orders all orders to purchase creation units whether through the nscc clearing process or “outside” the nscc clearing process through dtc facilities or otherwise must be received by the distributor no later than the order cutoff time designated as such in the participant agreement “ order cutoff time ” on the relevant business day in each case on the date such order is placed “ transmittal date ” in order for creation of creation units to be effected based on the nav of the relevant funds as determined on such date in the case of custom orders the order must be received by the distributor no later than  pm et or such other time as may be designated by the funds and disclosed to authorized participants the nscc clearing process is not currently available for purchases or redemptions of foreign funds accordingly authorized participants making payment for orders of creation units of shares of foreign funds must have international trading capabilities and must effect such transactions “outside” the nscc clearing process once the fund’s custodian has been notified of an order to purchase it will provide such information to the relevant subcustodians of each such foreign fund the fund’s custodian shall cause the subcustodians of each such foreign fund to maintain an account into which the authorized participant shall deliver on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting the portfolio deposit deposit instruments must be maintained by the applicable local subcustodians following the notice of intention an irrevocable order to purchase creation units in the form required by the fund must be received by the distributor as principal underwriter from an authorized participant on its own or another investor’s behalf by the closing time on the date such request is submitted except as described below the shares and deposit instruments of fixed income funds will clear and settle in the same manner as the shares and deposit instruments of equity funds because fixed income securities currently do not transfer through the nscc clearing process the nscc clearing process is not currently available for etfs that invest in fixed income securities therefore transactions must be effected “outside” the nscc clearing process deposit instruments that are us government or us agency securities and any cash will settle via free delivery through the federal reserve system non us fixed income securities will settle in accordance with the normal rules for settlement of such securities in the applicable non us market the shares will settle through dtc the custodian will monitor the movement of the underlying deposit instruments or cash and will instruct the movement of shares only upon validation that such securities or cash have settled correctly the settlement of shares will be aligned with the settlement of the underlying deposit instruments or cash and except as discussed below with respect to portfolio holdings traded in foreign markets will generally occur on a settlement cycle of t business days or shorter at the sole discretion of the trust on behalf of each fixed income fund  applicants do not believe the issuance and settlement of creation units in the manner described above will have any material impact on the arbitrage efficiency or the secondary market trading of shares of the fixed income funds each fund may recoup the settlement costs charged by nscc and dtc by imposing transaction fees on investors purchasing or redeeming creation units subject to the conditions that i a properly completed irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the authorized participant either on its own or another investor’s behalf not later than the closing time on the transmittal date and ii arrangements satisfactory to the applicable fund are in place for payment of the cash amount and any other cash amounts which may be due the applicable fund will accept the order subject to its right and the right of the distributor the adviser and the subadviser to reject any order not submitted in proper form a creation unit of a fund will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the fund of the deposit instruments and the payment of the cash amount have been completed notwithstanding the foregoing to the extent contemplated by a participant agreement creation units will be issued to an authorized participant notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding portfolio deposits have not been received in part or in whole in reliance on the undertaking of such authorized participant to deliver the missing deposit instruments as soon as  possible which undertaking shall be secured by such authorized participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral the participant agreement will permit the fund to use such collateral to buy the missing deposit instruments at any time and will subject the authorized participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the fund of purchasing such securities and the value of the collateral  rejection of creation unit purchase orders as noted above the distributor may reject any order to purchase creation units for any reason including if an order to purchase shares is not submitted in proper form in accordance with the terms of the participant agreement in addition a fund may reject a purchase order transmitted to it by the distributor if i the purchaser or group of related purchasers upon obtaining the creation units of shares of a fund order would own eighty percent  or more of the outstanding shares of such fund ii the acceptance of the portfolio deposit would have certain adverse tax consequences such as causing the fund no longer to meet ric status under the code for federal tax purposes iii the acceptance of the portfolio deposit would in the opinion of the fund be unlawful as in the case of a purchaser who was banned from trading in securities  iv the acceptance of the portfolio deposit would otherwise in the discretion of the fund the adviser andor subadvisers have an adverse effect on the fund or on the rights of the fund’s beneficial owners or v there exist circumstances outside the control of the fund that make it impossible to process purchases of creation units of shares for all practical purposes examples of such circumstances include acts of god or public service or utility problems such as fires floods extreme weather conditions and power outage resulting in telephone telecopy and computer failures market conditions or activities causing trading halts systems failures involving computer or other information systems affecting the funds the adviser any sub adviser the transfer agent the custodian the distributor dtc nscc or any other participant in the purchase process and similar extraordinary events j pricing the price of shares trading on an exchange will be based on a current bidoffer market the price of shares of each fund like the price of all traded securities will be subject to factors such as supply and demand as well as the current value of the portfolio holdings held by such fund or its respective master fund in addition shares are available for purchase or sale on an intraday basis on an exchange and do not have a fixed relationship to the previous day’s nav or the current day’s nav prices on an exchange therefore may be below at or above the most recently calculated nav of such shares no secondary sales will be made to brokers or dealers at a concession by the distributor or by a fund transactions involving the sale of shares on an exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges applicants believe that the existence of a continuous trading market on an exchange for shares together with the publication by the exchange of the current market value of the sum of the deposit instruments and the estimated cash amount will be features of each fund particularly attractive to certain types of investors applicants intend to emphasize these features in the marketing of shares k redemption beneficial owners of shares may sell their shares in the secondary market but must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit in order to redeem through the applicable fund redemption requests must  be placed by or through an authorized participant creation units will be redeemable at their nav per creation unit next determined after receipt of a request for redemption by the applicable fund consistent with the provisions of section e of the act and rule e thereunder the right to redeem will not be suspended nor payment upon redemption delayed except as provided by section e of the act except as may be permitted under the relief requested herein in connection with foreign funds see section iva redemption of shares in creation units will be subject to a transaction fee imposed in the same amount and manner as the transaction fee incurred in purchasing such shares redemption of shares may be made either through the nscc clearing process with respect to domestic funds only or “outside” the nscc clearing process through dtc facilities or otherwise with respect to fixed income funds or foreign funds  as discussed herein a redeeming investor will pay a transaction fee to offset the fund’s trading costs operational processing costs brokerage commissions and other similar costs incurred in transferring the portfolio holdings from its account to the account of the redeeming investor an entity redeeming shares in creation units “outside” the nscc clearing process may be required to pay a higher transaction fee than would have been charged had the redemption been effected through the nscc clearing process a redeeming investor receiving cash in lieu of one or more portfolio holdings may also be assessed a higher transaction fee on the cash in lieu portion to cover the costs of selling such securities including all the costs listed above plus all or part of the spread between the expected bid and offer side of the market relating to such portfolio holdings this higher transaction fee will be assessed in the same manner as the transaction fee incurred in purchasing creation units to the extent contemplated by a participant agreement in the event an authorized participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the creation unit to be redeemed to the distributor on behalf of the fund by the closing time of the regular trading session on the exchange on the date such redemption request is submitted the distributor will nonetheless accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the authorized participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible which undertaking shall be secured by the authorized participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral the participant agreement will permit the relevant fund to use such collateral to purchase the missing shares or acquire the deposit instruments and the cash amount underlying such shares and will subject the authorized participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost of the fund acquiring such shares deposit instruments or cash amount and the value of the collateral a redemption request “outside” the nscc clearing process will be considered to be in proper form if i a duly completed request form is received by the distributor from the authorized participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor at a time specified by the fund currently expected to be  pm et and ii arrangements satisfactory to the fund are in place for the authorized participant to transfer or cause to be transferred to the fund the creation unit of such fund being redeemed through the bookentry system of the depository on or before contractual settlement of the redemption request in the case of shares of foreign funds upon redemption of creation units and taking delivery of the redemption instruments into the securities account of the redeeming shareholder or an authorized participant acting on behalf of such investor such person must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a brokerdealer bank or other custody provider in each jurisdiction in which any of such redemption instruments are customarily traded  l dividend reinvestment service no fund will make dtc bookentry dividend reinvestment service available for use by beneficial owners for reinvestment of their cash proceeds but certain individual brokers may make a dividend reinvestment service available to their clients m shareholder transaction and distribution expenses no sales charges for purchases of creation units of any fund are contemplated as indicated above in section iik “redemption” each fund will charge a transaction fee only to those investors purchasing and redeeming shares in creation units investors purchasing and selling shares in the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions fees and expenses each fund may be authorized to implement a plan under rule b of the act of up to  basis points calculated on the average daily nav of each fund n masterfeeder structure  inkind transactions in a masterfeeder structure as discussed above applicants currently anticipate that certain funds will operate in a masterfeeder structure substantially identical to the structures permitted under section de of the act each master fund would also operate as a traditional mutual fund issuing and redeeming shares in accordance with the requirements of section  of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder however applicants request that the exemption from section e requested herein apply to both the funds and their respective master funds the shareholders of the master fund are currently anticipated to be exclusively i other investment companies or other pooled investment vehicles that are in the same group of investment companies as the feeder fund  and ii other institutional investors such as separate accounts managed by the adviser and the interests in the master fund will be sold to and redeemed by each of the master fund’s shareholders on the same terms and will carry the same rights from the investor’s perspective the creation and redemption process will be unaffected by the masterfeeder structure for creations an investor will deliver a basket consisting of inkind securities andor cash to the feeder fund and the feeder fund will in turn deliver the basket to the master fund in exchange for interests in the master fund redemptions will work the same way but in reverse at no point will securities delivered inkind to a feeder fund settle to the account of the feeder fund nor will a feeder fund hold any investment other than the securities of its corresponding master fund  no senior securities while shareholders of the feeder funds may have different rights of redemption versus shareholders of a traditional mutual fund feeder fund in accordance with the masterfeeder relief requested in this application the relief requested in this application will not result in any shareholders of any master fund having different rights relative to other shareholders of the same master fund specifically the master fund will not require but rather will permit any shareholder feeder fund including a feeder fund to redeem inkind similarly the master fund will not require but rather will permit all shareholder feeder funds including a feeder fund to purchase and redeem shares in large aggregations as a result the proposed structure does not give rise to a senior security and should not raise any concerns under section  of the act o shareholder reports each fund will furnish to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial owners of shares notifications with respect to each distribution as well as an annual notification as to the tax status of such fund’s distributions each fund will also furnish to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial owners of shares the fund’s annual report containing audited financial statements as well as copies of annual and semiannual shareholder reports  p availability of information regarding shares and underlying indexes as noted above before commencement of trading on the exchange on each business day the identities and quantities of the portfolio securities and other assets held by the selfindexing fund or its respective master fund that will form the basis for the selfindexing fund’s calculation of nav at the end of the business day will be made available on the website similarly for each longshort fund and  fund the adviser will provide full portfolio transparency on the fund’s website by making available the identities and quantities of the portfolio holdings including short positions and financial instruments that will form the basis for the fund’s calculation of nav at the end of the business day this disclosure will look through any whollyowned subsidiary and identify the specific portfolio holdings held by that entity the information provided on the website will be formatted to be readerfriendly the funds’ administrator will provide an estimated cash amount adjusted through the close of the trading day to the relevant listing exchange each listing exchange or other major market data provider will disseminate every  seconds during regular exchange trading hours through the facilities of the consolidated tape association or other widely disseminated means an amount for each fund stated on a per individual share basis representing the sum of i the estimated cash amount and ii the current value of the deposit instruments such intraday indicative value the “ iiv ” the listing exchange will not be involved in or be responsible for the calculation of the estimated cash amount nor will it guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the estimated cash amount no fund will be involved in or responsible for the calculation or dissemination of the iiv and will make no warranty as to its accuracy the value of the underlying indexes with respect to the funds will be disseminated by the relevant listing exchange or such other organization authorized by the index provider in accordance with commission and exchange requirements  applicants expect the same from the index providers of future underlying indexes and future primary listing exchanges in addition these organizations will disseminate values for each underlying index once each trading day based on closing prices in the relevant exchange market each fund will make available on a daily basis the names and required numbers of each of the deposit instruments as well as information regarding the cash amount the website will publish the current version of the prospectus and statement of additional information “ sai ” the website also will disclose the prior business day’s nav and the market closing price or the midpoint of the bidask spread at the time of calculation of the relevant fund’s nav “ bidask price ” and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or bidask price against such nav the website will be publicly available at no charge prior to the public offering of shares the closing prices of each fund’s deposit instruments and short positions will be readily available from as applicable the relevant listing exchange automated quotation systems published or other public sources such as finra’s trace reporting and compliance system or online information services such as quotron bloomberg or reuters similarly information regarding market and prices and volume of shares will be broadly available on a real time basis throughout the trading day in addition applicants expect given the past history of other etfs that shares will be followed closely by stock market and mutual fund professionals as well as investment advisers who will offer their analysis of why investors should purchase hold sell or avoid shares in conclusion exchange listing of shares should help ensure that there is a substantial amount of raw data available and that such data is packaged analyzed and widely disseminated to the investing public as noted above the funds may operate in a masterfeeder structure under such circumstances the feeder funds would operate and would be marketed as etfs applicants do not believe the masterfeeder structure contemplated in this application would be confusing to investors because any additional feeder fund that is a traditional mutual fund or other pooled investment vehicle would be marketed separately further etfs are no longer new or novel products and applicants believe investors are aware of the differences between etfs and traditional mutual funds in addition functionally similar structures are currently offered in  the market without giving rise to investor confusion  notwithstanding the limited potential for investor confusion applicants will take numerous steps to ensure that investors are not confused specifically the prospectus for each feeder fund will clearly indicate that the feeder fund is an etf each feeder fund will have a prospectus separate and distinct from any other feeder funds and as required by the conditions herein the feeder funds will not be marketed as mutual funds applicants believe that the efforts outlined above will ensure that every interested investor will understand the differences between the funds and any feeder funds q public representations applicants will take such steps as may be necessary to avoid confusion in the public’s mind between the funds and a traditional “openend investment company” or “mutual fund” although the trust will be classified and registered under the act as an openend management investment company neither the trust nor any of its individual funds will be advertised or marketed or otherwise “held out” as a traditional openend investment company or a mutual fund instead each fund will be marketed as an “etf” to that end the designation of the funds in all marketing materials will be limited to the terms “etf” “investment company” “fund” and “trust” without reference to an “openend fund” or a “mutual fund” except to compare and contrast the funds with traditional openend management investment companies which may be referred to as “mutual funds” all marketing materials that describe the features or method of obtaining buying or selling creation units or shares traded on an exchange or refer to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and will disclose that the owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only the same approach will be followed in connection with investor educational materials issued or circulated in connection with the shares the primary disclosure document with respect to the shares will be the fund’s prospectus as with all investment company securities the purchase of shares in creation units will be accompanied or preceded by statutory prospectus or summary prospectus  the funds will provide copies of their annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to shareholders the above policies and format will also be followed in all reports to shareholders the prospectus for each selfindexing fund will prominently disclose that the index provider is an affiliated index provider and describe the nature of the affiliation r procedure by which shares will reach investors disclosure documents based on the experience of other etfs applicants expect that there will be several categories of market participants who are likely to be interested in purchasing creation units of a fund one is the institutional investor that desires to keep a portion of its portfolio indexed to the relevant underlying index and finds shares a cost effective means to do so with the added benefit of exchangetraded liquidity should it wish to sell some or all of its holding institutional investors may also wish to purchase or redeem creation units of a fund to take advantage of the potential arbitrage opportunities in much the same manner as the arbitrageurs discussed in the next sentence the other likely institutional investor is the arbitrageur who stands ready to take advantage of any slight premium or discount in the market price of shares on an exchange versus the aggregate value of the portfolio holdings held by such fund applicants do not expect that arbitrageurs will hold positions in shares for any length of time unless the positions are appropriately hedged applicants believe that arbitrageurs will purchase or redeem creation units of a fund in pursuit of arbitrage profit and in so doing will enhance the liquidity of the secondary market as well as keep the market price of shares close to their nav lastly applicants observe that market makers acting in their roles to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for the shares may from time to time find it appropriate to purchase or redeem creation units in connection with their market making activities  in the above examples those who purchase shares in creation units may hold such shares or may at the time of purchase or at a later time sell such shares into the secondary market applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional investors and “retail” investors for whom such shares provide a useful “retailpriced” exchangetraded mechanism for investing in the country industry market market segment or market sector represented by the relevant underlying index the price at which shares trade will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the option continually to purchase or redeem shares in creation units which should help to ensure that shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav as described above shares in creation units will be offered continuously to the public because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis at any point during the life of the relevant fund a “distribution” as such term is used in the securities act may be occurring the distributor will act as coordinator in connection with the production and distribution of such materials to brokerdealers and will make generally known among the brokerdealer community that a current version of such fund’s prospectus and sai may be obtained through the distributor brokerage firms will be able to order in advance their anticipated quantities of such materials from the distributor additionally the distributor will arrange to deliver the fund’s prospectus and sai to the listing exchange where they will be available for review by investors iii in support of the application a etf relief applicants seek an order from the commission permitting  the funds to issue shares that are redeemable in creation units only  secondary market transactions in shares on an exchange at negotiated prices rather than at the current offering price  certain affiliated persons of each fund to deposit securities into and receive securities from each fund in connection with the purchase and redemption of creation units all as more fully set forth below  a foreign fund to provide payment or satisfaction of redemption requests in periods exceeding seven days in certain circumstances and  certain funds to perform creations and redemptions of creation units inkind in a masterfeeder structure the relief specified below is requested pursuant to section c of the act which provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act “if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act” applicants believe that shares of each fund will afford significant benefits in the public interest among other benefits availability of shares should provide increased investment opportunities which should encourage diversified investment provide in the case of individual tradable shares a relatively lowcost marketbasket security for small and middlesized accounts of individuals and institutions that would be available at intraday prices reflecting minutebyminute market conditions rather than only closing prices make available a vehicle that would track the selected underlying indexes more closely than most alternative marketbasket investments due in part to the realization of efficiencies and cost savings provide a security that should be freely available in response to market demand provide competition for comparable products available in both foreign and us markets attract capital to the us markets provide enhanced liquidity facilitate the implementation of diversified investment management techniques and provide a more tax efficient investment vehicle than most traditional mutual funds or closedend funds  the commission has indicated that section c permits it to exempt “particular vehicles and particular interests” from provisions of the act that would inhibit “competitive development of new products and new markets offered and sold in or from the united states” investment company act release no  june   at  the shares proposed to be offered would provide to both retail and institutional investors new exchangetraded investment company products representing interests in targeted securities markets as such applicants believe the shares of the funds are appropriate for exemptive relief under section c applicants have made every effort to achieve their stated objectives in a manner consistent with existing statutory and regulatory constraints and within the substantive limits of exemptive relief previously granted to others they have concluded that inkind redemption of creation units of the funds to the maximum extent practicable as described herein will be essential in order to minimize the need for selling securities of a fund’s or its respective master fund’s portfolio to meet redemptions to permit the maximum amount of resources of each fund or its respective master fund to be used to track the underlying index and to alleviate the inappropriate taxation of ongoing shareholders with respect to the exemptive relief specified below regarding sections a and a relief is requested pursuant to section b which provides that the commission may approve the sale of securities to an investment company and the purchase of securities from an investment company in both cases by an affiliated person of such company if the commission finds that “terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act” the sale and redemption of creation units of each fund is on the same terms for all investors whether or not such investor is an affiliate in each case creation units are sold and redeemed by each fund at their nav the portfolio deposit for a fund is based on a standard applicable to all investors and valued in the same manner in all cases such transactions do not involve “overreaching” by an affiliated person accordingly applicants believe the proposed transactions described herein meet the section b standards for relief because the terms of such proposed transactions including the consideration to be paid or received for the creation units are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transactions will be consistent with the policy of each fund and will be consistent with the investment objectives and policies of each fund of funds as described herein and are consistent with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the act the exemptions and order requested are also substantially similar to those granted in prior orders b fund of funds relief applicants also seek an order from the commission permitting both investing management companies and investing trusts to acquire shares of the funds beyond the limits of section da of the act and permitting such funds their distributor and brokers to sell shares of each such fund to funds of funds in excess of the limits of section db of the act in addition pursuant to sections c and b applicants request an exemption from section a of the act to permit each fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds that owns  or more of the fund’s shares the fund of funds relief is requested pursuant to section dj of the act applicants submit that the proposed transactions are consistent with congressional intent that the commission grant exemptions under section d j coincident with the evolution of investment companies investing in other investment  companies applicants submit that the structure of the proposed transaction as well as the proposed conditions to the relief from the limitations of section d  requested in this application including the requirement that funds of funds enter into a fof participation agreement as defined below adequately address the concerns underlying the applicable limits in section d and that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants assert that the relief requested is substantially similar to that granted by the prior orders iv request for order a legal analysis etf relief  exemption from the provisions of sections a and a section a of the act defines an “openend company” as “a management company which is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer” the term “redeemable security” is defined in section a  of the act as “any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer or to a person designated by the issuer is entitled whether absolutely or only out of surplus to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer’s current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof” applicants believe that the shares could be viewed as satisfying the section a definition of a redeemable security and consequently each fund could be viewed as satisfying the definitional requirement of an openend company offering for sale a redeemable security of which it is the issuer shares are securities “under the terms of which” an owner may receive his proportionate share of the fund’s or its respective master fund’s current net assets the unusual aspect of such shares is that its terms provide for such a right to redemption only when such individual shares are aggregated with a specified number of such other individual shares that together constitute a redeemable creation unit because the redeemable creation units of a fund can be unbundled into individual shares that are not individually redeemable a possible question arises as to whether the definitional requirements of a “redeemable security” or an “openend company” under the act would be met if such individual shares are viewed as nonredeemable securities in light of this possible analysis applicants request an order to permit each fund to register as an openend management investment company and issue individual shares that are redeemable only in creation units as described herein creation units will always be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the act owners of shares may purchase the requisite number of shares and tender the resulting creation units for redemption moreover listing and trading on an exchange will afford all holders of shares the benefit of intraday liquidity because creation units may always be purchased and redeemed at nav less certain transactional expenses the price of creation units on the secondary market and the price of the individual shares of a creation unit taken together should not vary materially from the nav of creation unit moreover applicants believe that the existence of shares does not appear to thwart the purposes of any other provision of the act that but for the exemption requested herein with respect to sections a and a would be applicable to each fund applicants believe that permitting each fund to register as an openend investment company and issue redeemable creation units of individual shares as described herein is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and accordingly applicants hereby request that an order of exemption be granted   exemption from the provisions of section d and rule c section d of the act provides in part that  “no registered investment company shall sell any redeemable security issued by it to any person except to or through a principal underwriter for distribution or at a current public offering price described in the prospectus” rule c provides that “no registered investment company issuing any redeemable security no person designated in such issuer’s prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and no principal underwriter of or dealer in any such security shall sell redeem or repurchase any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security” shares of each fund will be listed on a listing exchange and the relevant market maker will maintain a market for such shares secondary market transactions in shares occurring on any exchange will be effected at negotiated prices not on the basis of nav next calculated after receipt of any sale order  the shares will trade on and away from  the listing exchange at all times on the basis of current bidoffer prices the purchase and sale of shares of each fund will not therefore be accomplished at an offering price described in the fund’s prospectus as required by section d nor will sales and repurchases be made at a price based on the current nav next computed after receipt of an order as required by rule c applicants believe that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d and rule c with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing of shares while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been intended  to prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers  to prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and  to ensure an orderly distribution system of shares by contract dealers by eliminating price competition from noncontract dealers who could offer investors shares at less than the published sales price and who could pay investors a little more than the published redemption price  the first two purposes—preventing dilution caused by risklesstrading schemes and preventing unjust discrimination among buyers—would not seem to be relevant issues for secondary trading by dealers in shares of a fund secondary market transactions in shares would not cause dilution for owners of such shares because such transactions do not directly involve a fund’s or its respective master fund’s assets similarly secondary market trading in shares should not create discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand but do not occur as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation with respect to the third possible purpose of section d applicants believe that the proposed distribution system will be orderly anyone may sell or acquire shares either by purchasing them on the exchange or by creating one or more creation units therefore no dealer should have an advantage over any other dealer in the sale of such shares indeed applicants believe that the presence of the market maker will also help to provide an orderly market in addition secondary market transactions in shares should generally occur at prices roughly equivalent to their nav if the prices for shares should fall below the proportionate nav of the underlying fund’s or its respective master fund’s assets an investor needs only to accumulate enough individual shares of such fund to constitute a creation unit in order to redeem such shares at nav competitive forces in the marketplace should thus ensure that the margin between nav and the price for shares in the secondary market remains narrow applicants believe that to date shares of etfs have consistently traded on at or very close to their respective navs applicants have strong reason to believe that the trading experience of shares should closely resemble that of shares of prior etfs  on the basis of the foregoing applicants believe i that the protections intended to be afforded by section d and rule c are adequately addressed by the proposed methods for creating redeeming and pricing creation units and pricing and trading shares and ii that the relief requested is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act accordingly applicants hereby request that an order of exemption under section c be granted in respect of section d and rule c  exemption from the provisions of sections a and a applicants seek an exemption from sections a and a of the act pursuant to sections c and b of the act to permit certain affiliated persons to effectuate purchases and redemptions “inkind” section a of the act makes it unlawful “for any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company  or any affiliated person of such a person promoter or principal underwriter acting as principal knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered company or to any company controlled by such registered company unless such sale involves solely a securities of which the buyer is the issuer b securities of which the seller is the issuer and which are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its securities or c securities deposited with a trustee of a unit investment trust  by the depositor thereof” section a of the act makes it unlawful “for any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter for a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person promoter or principal underwriter acting as principal knowingly to purchase from such registered company or from any company controlled by such registered company any security or other property except securities of which the seller is the issuer” an “affiliated person” of a fund pursuant to section aa of the act includes “any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with the power to vote  per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person” and pursuant to section ac of the act “any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person” section a of the act defines “control” as “the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company any person who owns beneficially either directly or through one or more controlled companies more than  per centum of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed to control such company any person who does not so own more than  per centum of the voting securities of any company shall be presumed not to control such company” the funds may be deemed to be controlled by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other in addition the funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser an “ affiliated fund ” section b provides that the commission will grant an exemption from the provisions of section a if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  past applications of prior etfs have suggested the possibility that section b could be interpreted to exempt only a single transaction from section a and that relief for a series of ongoing transactions such as the ongoing sale and redemption of creation units requires an exemption under section c of the act as well accordingly applicants are also requesting an exemption from section a under section c  to the extent that there are twenty or fewer holders of creation units of all of the funds or of one or more particular funds some or all of such holders will be at least  percent owners of such funds and one or more may hold in excess of  percent of such funds as the case may be and would therefore be deemed to be affiliated persons of such funds either under section aa or section ac for so long as such holders of shares were deemed to be affiliated persons eg so long as twenty or fewer such holders existed section a could be read to prohibit such persons from depositing the portfolio deposit with a fund in return for creation units an “inkind” purchase and likewise section a  could be read to prohibit such persons from entering into an “inkind” redemption procedure with a fund furthermore under other circumstances one or more holders of shares might each accumulate  percent or more of such fund’s securities also the market maker for the shares of any relevant funds might accumulate from time to time  percent or more of such fund’s securities in connection with such market maker’s marketmaking activities in addition one or more holders of shares or the market maker might from time to time accumulate in excess of  percent of the shares of one or more funds and such persons would therefore be deemed to be affiliated persons of such funds under section ac applicants request an exemption to permit persons that are affiliated persons of the funds or affiliated persons of such persons collectively “ secondtier affiliates ” solely by virtue of one or more of the following  holding  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds  an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in  or  holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more affiliated funds to effectuate purchases and redemptions “inkind” applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting such affiliated persons from making “in kind” purchases or “inkind” redemptions of shares of a fund in creation units both the deposit procedures for “inkind” purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for “inkind” redemptions of creation units will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions regardless of size or number it is immaterial to a fund whether  or  creation units exist for such fund all will be issued and redeemed in the same manner there will be no discrimination between purchasers or redeemers deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be valued in the identical manner as those portfolio holdings currently held by the relevant funds or their respective master funds and the valuation of the deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be made in an identical manner regardless of the identity of the purchaser or redeemer applicants also note that the ability to take deposits and make redemptions “inkind” will help each fund or its respective master fund to track closely its underlying index and therefore aid in achieving the fund’s objectives applicants do not believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching but rather assert that such procedures will be implemented consistently with each fund’s objectives and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will be made on terms reasonable to applicants and any affiliated persons because they will be valued pursuant to verifiable objective standards the method of valuing portfolio holdings held by a fund is identical to that used for calculating “inkind” purchase or redemption values and therefore creates no opportunity for affiliated persons or secondtier affiliates of applicants to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of shares of that fund similarly applicants submit that by using the same standards for valuing portfolio holdings held by a fund as are used for calculating “inkind” redemptions or purchases the fund will ensure that its nav will not be adversely affected by such securities transactions in addition to the customary relief from the requirements of sections a and a permitting inkind creations and redemptions by investors who are affiliates of a fund by virtue of holding more than  or  of the fund’s shares to the extent that a fund operates in a masterfeeder structure applicants also  request relief permitting the feeder funds to engage in inkind creations and redemptions with the applicable master fund the customary sections a and a relief would not be sufficient to permit such transactions because the feeder funds and the applicable master fund could also be affiliated by virtue of having the same investment adviser however as with the customary section  relief applicants believe that inkind creations and redemptions between a feeder fund and a master fund advised by the same investment adviser do not involve “overreaching” by an affiliated person such transactions will occur only at the feeder fund’s proportionate share of the master fund’s net assets and the distributed securities will be valued in the same manner as they are valued for the purposes of calculating the applicable master fund’s nav further all such transactions will be effected with respect to predetermined securities and on the same terms with respect to all investors finally such a transaction would only occur as a result of and to effectuate a creation or redemption transaction between the feeder fund and a thirdparty investor for the reasons set forth above applicants believe that i with respect to the relief requested pursuant to section b the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each fund and will be consistent with the investment objectives and policies of each fund of funds and that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the act and ii with respect to the relief requested pursuant to section c the requested exemption for the proposed transactions is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  exemption from the provisions of section e applicants seek an order of the commission under section c of the act granting an exemption from section e of the act  applicants acknowledge that no relief obtained from the requirements of section e will affect any obligations applicants may otherwise have under rule c under the exchange act requiring that most securities transactions be settled within three business days of the trade date section e of the act provides that “no registered investment company shall suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption of any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after the tender of such security to the company or its agent designated for that purpose for redemption except  for any period a during which the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or b during which trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which a disposal by the company of securities owned by it is not reasonably practical or b it is not reasonably practicable for such company fairly to determine the value of its net assets or  for such other periods as the commission may by order permit for the protection of security holders of the company” settlement of redemptions for a foreign fund will be contingent not only on the securities settlement cycle of the united states market but also on the delivery cycles in local markets for the underlying foreign securities held by a foreign fund applicants have been advised that the delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring redemption instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules including in russia may require a delivery process of up to fifteen  calendar days rather than seven calendar days for a foreign fund in certain circumstances during the calendar year accordingly with respect to foreign funds only applicants hereby request relief from the requirement imposed by section e to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within seven calendar days following the tender of a creation  unit of such fund or its respective master fund up to a maximum of fifteen calendar days applicants request that relief be granted such that foreign funds holding redemption instruments which require a delivery process in excess of seven calendar days may provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within not more than the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local foreign markets where transactions in the portfolio holdings of each such foreign fund or its respective master fund customarily clear and settle but in all cases no later than fifteen calendar days following the tender of a creation unit with respect to future funds that will be foreign funds or their respective master funds applicants seek the same relief from section e only to the extent that circumstances exist similar to those described herein based on information available to applicants although certain holidays may occur on different dates in subsequent years the number of days up to a maximum of fifteen calendar days required to deliver redemption proceeds in any given year will not exceed fifteen calendar days for any of the funds requiring exemptive relief from the provisions of section e the sais for the foreign funds that may require this relief will identify i those instances in a given year where due to local holidays more than seven calendar days will be needed to deliver redemption proceeds and will list such holidays and ii the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds up to fifteen calendar days the sai will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date thereof if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds for each foreign fund applicants believe that congress adopted section e to prevent unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants propose that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a foreign fund to be made within fifteen calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants suggest that a redemption payment occurring within fifteen calendar days following a redemption request would adequately afford investor protection applicants desire to incorporate the creation and redemption mechanism for creation units as much as possible into the processing cycles for securities deliveries currently practicable in the principal markets for the portfolio holdings of a given foreign fund or its respective master fund currently it is believed that no significant additional system or operational procedures will be needed to purchase or redeem creation units beyond those already generally in place in the relevant jurisdiction applicants believe that this approach may make creations and redemptions of creation units less costly to administer enhance the appeal of the product to professional participants and thereby promote the liquidity of the shares in the secondary market with benefits to all holders thereof as noted above applicants intend to utilize inkind redemptions to the maximum extent possible principally as a method of assuring the fullest investment of fund’s assets in portfolio holdings applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to foreign funds or their respective master funds that do not effect creations and redemptions of creation units inkind applicants if using a masterfeeder structure will operate in substantially the same manner in the case of an in kind redemption from a feeder fund as discussed herein the feeder fund would make a corresponding redemption from the master fund applicants do not believe the masterfeeder structure would have any impact on the delivery cycle when a feeder fund is seeking a cash redemption the proceeds to satisfy the redemption would likely be raised in a manner consistent with the master fund’s investment objective eg by using cash on hand andor selling securities when the adviser or subadviser determines it is necessary to sell securities such sales would be conducted consistent with the master fund’s investment objective as a practical matter any cash redemption could reduce the proportion of the most liquid assets held by the master fund but no more so than any investment company – as shares are redeemed there is potentially a reduction in the most liquid assets in a portfolio applicants do not believe that shareholders of the feeder  funds will be disadvantaged relative to shareholders of other feeder funds in each case the redeeming feeder fund shareholders through their authorized participant will receive redemption instruments and cash if any equal in value to the next calculated nav further the list of redemption instruments that a redeemer will receive from a feeder fund will be published daily if the requested relief is granted applicants intend to disclose in each foreign fund’s sai and all relevant sales literature that redemption payments will be effected within the specified number of calendar days following the date on which a request for redemption in proper form is made given the rationale for what amounts to a delay typically of a few days in the redemption process on certain occasions and given the facts as recited above the applicants believe that the redemption mechanism described above will not lead to unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the redemption process applicants assert that the request for relief from the strict sevenday rule imposed by section e is not inconsistent with the standards articulated in section c given the facts as recited above applicants believe that the granting of the requested relief is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the act applicants note that exemptive relief from section e substantially identical to the relief sought in this application was obtained by prior etfs in orders relating to each of those funds on the basis of the foregoing applicants believe i that the protections intended to be afforded by section e are adequately addressed by the proposed method and securities delivery cycles for redeeming creation units and ii that the relief requested is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act accordingly applicants hereby respectfully request that an order of exemption be granted under section c in respect of section e b legal analysis fund of funds relief  exemption from the provisions of section d applicants request an exemption to permit funds of funds to acquire shares of the funds in excess of the limits in section da of the act and to permit the funds and their principal underwriters and brokers to sell shares of the funds to funds of funds in excess of the limits in section db of the act the funds of funds do not include the funds each investing management company will be advised by an investment adviser within the meaning of section aa of the act “ fund of funds adviser ” and may be subadvised by investment advisers within the meaning of section ab of the act “ fund of funds subadviser ” each fund of funds adviser will be registered as an investment adviser under the advisers act any fund of funds subadviser to an investing management company will be registered as an investment adviser or will not be required to register each investing trust will have a sponsor “ sponsor ” as noted above applicants are also seeking relief from sections da and db to the extent necessary to permit the feeder funds to perform creations and redemptions of shares inkind in a masterfeeder structure this structure is substantially identical to traditional masterfeeder structures permitted pursuant to the exception provided in section de section de provides that the percentage limitations of sections da and section d b shall not apply to a security issued by an investment company in this case the shares of the applicable master fund if among other things that security is the only investment security held by the feeder fund applicants believe the proposed masterfeeder structure complies with section de because each feeder fund will hold only investment securities issued by its corresponding master fund however the feeder funds may receive securities other than securities of its corresponding master fund if a feeder fund accepts an inkind creation  applicants do not believe that the securities involved in the inkind transactions are ever “held” on the books of a feeder fund  because the feeder fund is merely acting as a conduit through which securities are delivered from the investor to the master fund and the securities received are never settled to the feeder fund however there is potentially a hypothetical moment when accepting or distributing securities in kind that such securities could be deemed “held” by a feeder fund as a result to the extent that a feeder fund may be deemed to be holding both shares of the master fund and for a hypothetical moment in the course of a creation or redemption other securities the applicants are requesting appropriate relief from sections da and section d b the feeder funds would operate in compliance with all other provisions of section de applicants are requesting an order under section dj of the act exempting certain transactions involving the funds from sections da and section db of the act and under sections c and b of the act exempting certain transactions involving the funds from section a of the act the requested exemption would permit the fund of funds to acquire shares in each of the funds beyond the limitations in section da applicants are also requesting relief from sections a and  to permit each fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds when the fund is an affiliated person of the fund of funds section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring securities of an investment company if such securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter and any other brokerdealer from selling the investment company’s shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired company’s voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired company’s voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally a exemption under section dj of the act the national securities markets improvement act of  “ nsmia ”  added section dj to the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors the legislative history of nsmia directs the commission to consider among other things when granting relief under section dj “the extent to which a proposed arrangement is subject to conditions that are designed to address conflicts of interest and overreaching by a participant in the arrangement so that the abuses that gave rise to the initial adoption of the act’s restrictions against investment companies investing in other investment companies are not repeated”  applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the fund of funds relief requested in this application including the requirement that each fund of funds enter into a fof participation agreement defined below with the relevant fund adequately address the concerns underlying the applicable limits in section d a and that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants also submit that the proposed transactions are consistent with congressional intent that the commission grant exemptions under section dj in a “progressive way” as the concept of investment companies investing in other investment companies evolves over time  b concerns underlying section dj congress enacted section d then section c in  to prevent one investment company from buying control of another investment company  in enacting section d congress sought to ensure that the acquiring investment company had no “effective voice”   in the other investment company  as originally proposed section d would have prohibited any investment by an investment company in another investment company congress relaxed the prohibition in the section’s final version presumably  because there was some concern that an investment company should not be prohibited from taking advantage of a good investment just because the investment was another investment company you may get situations where one investment company may think that the securities of another investment company are a good buy and it was not thought advisable to freeze that type of purchase  congress tightened section d’s restrictions in  to address certain abuses perceived to be associated with the development of fund holding companies ie funds that primarily invest in other investment companies  these new abuses included i undue influence such as through the threat of largescale redemptions of the acquired fund’s shares ii layering of fees and expenses such as sales loads advisory fees and administrative costs and iii unnecessary complexity the commission identified these abuses in its  report to congress titled public policy implications of investment company growth “ ppi report ”  applicants propose a number of conditions designed to address these concerns certain of applicants’ proposed conditions address the concerns about largescale redemptions identified in the ppi report particularly those regarding the potential for undue influence applicants will take steps to ensure that the fund of funds comply with any terms and conditions of the requested relief by requesting that a fund of funds enter into a written agreement “ fof participation agreement ” as a condition precedent to investing in a fund beyond the limits imposed by section da the fof participation agreement will require the fund of funds to adhere to the terms and conditions of the requested order condition b limits the ability of a fund of funds’ advisory group or a fund of funds’ subadvisory group individually or in the aggregate each defined below to control a fund or its respective master fund within the meaning of section a of the act for purposes of this application a “ fund of funds ’ advisory group ”   is defined as the fund of funds’ adviser or sponsor any person controlling controlled by or under common control with such adviser or sponsor and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act that is advised or sponsored by the fund of funds adviser the sponsor or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with such adviser or sponsor for purposes of this application a “ fund of funds ’ subadvisory group ”   is defined as any fund of funds’ sub adviser any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the subadviser and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act or portion of such investment company or issuer advised or sponsored by the subadviser or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the subadviser the condition does not apply to the fund of funds subadvisory group with respect to a fund for which the fund of funds subadviser or a person controlling controlled by or under common control with the fund of funds subadviser acts as the investment adviser within the meaning of section aa of the act condition b prohibits a fund of funds and fund of funds affiliates from causing an investment by the fund of funds in a fund to influence the terms of services or transactions between a fund of funds or a fund of funds affiliate and the fund or its respective master fund or fund affiliate “ fund affiliate ”   is defined as an investment adviser promoter or principal underwriter of a fund or its respective master fund and any person controlling controlled by or under common control with any of these entities “ fund of funds affiliate ”   is defined as the fund of funds adviser fund of funds sub adviser sponsor promoter and principal underwriter of a fund of funds and any person controlling controlled by or under common control with any of these entities conditions b b b b and b are also designed to address the potential for a fund of funds and certain affiliates of a fund of funds including underwriting affiliates to exercise undue influence over a fund or its respective master fund and certain of its affiliates for purposes of this application an “underwriting affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor of the fund of funds or a person of which any such officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser or fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor is an affiliated person an  underwriting affiliate does not include any person whose relationship to the fund is covered by section f of the act also an offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an underwriting affiliate is an “ affiliated underwriting ” condition b is intended to insure that the fund’s board and the adviser as well as the fund of funds’ board of directors and investment adviser or trustee and sponsor as applicable understand the terms and conditions of the exemptive order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order a representation to this effect is required to be included in the fof participation agreement which must be in effect between the fund and a fund of funds before an investment is made in excess of section da a fund may choose to reject any direct purchase of creation units by a fund of funds to the extent a fund of funds purchases shares in the secondary market a fund would still retain its ability to reject initial purchases of shares made in reliance on the requested order by declining to enter into the fof participation agreement prior to any investment by a fund of funds in excess of the limits of section da with respect to concerns regarding layering of fees and expenses applicants propose several conditions under condition b before approving any advisory contract under section  of the act the board of directors or trustees of any investing management company including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act “ disinterested directors or trustees ” will be required to find that the advisory fees charged under the contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to rather than duplicative of services provided under the advisory contract of any fund or its respective master fund in which the investing management company may invest these findings and their basis will be recorded fully in the minute books of the investing management company in addition to condition b discussed above conditions b and b of the requested order are designed to prevent unnecessary duplication or layering of sales charges and other costs under condition b a fund of funds adviser or a fund of funds’ trustee or sponsor as applicable will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the fund of funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a fund under rule b  under the act received from a fund by the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or an affiliated person of the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor other than any advisory fees paid to the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or its affiliated person by a fund in connection with the investment by the fund of funds in the fund condition b also provides that any fund of funds subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the fund of funds subadviser directly or indirectly by the fund of funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation received by the fund of funds sub adviser or an affiliated person of the fund of funds subadviser other than any advisory fees paid to the fund of funds subadviser or its affiliated person by the fund in connection with any investment by the fund of funds in the fund made at the direction of the fund of funds subadviser in the event that the fund of funds subadviser waives fees the benefit of the waiver will be passed through to the fund of funds condition b prevents any sales charges or service fees on shares of a fund of funds from exceeding the limits applicable to a fund of funds set forth in the nasd conduct rule   a fund of funds may rely on the order only to invest in funds and not in any other registered investment company the fof participation agreement also will include an acknowledgement from the fund of funds that it may rely on the requested order only to invest in the funds and not in any other investment company no fund or its respective master fund will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent i the fund or its respective master fund acquires securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund or its respective master fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes ii the fund acquires securities of the master fund pursuant to the masterfeeder relief or iii the fund invests in  a whollyowned subsidiary that is a whollyowned and controlled subsidiary of the fund or its respective master fund as described in the application further no whollyowned subsidiary will acquire securities of any other investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act other than money market funds that comply with rule a for shortterm cash management purposes thus in keeping with the ppi report’s concern with overly complex structures applicants submit that the requested fund of funds relief will not create or give rise to circumstances enabling a fund of funds to invest in excess of the limits of section da in a fund which is in turn able to invest in another investment company or c or c issuer in excess of such limits in addition to avoiding excess complexity applicants believe that the condition requiring that funds or their respective master funds will not except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund or its respective master fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes or pursuant to the masterfeeder relief invest in any other investment company or c or c issuer other than a whollyowned subsidiary in excess of the limits of section da mitigates the concerns about layering of fees as noted above the funds or their respective master funds may invest in whollyowned subsidiaries to pursue their investment objectives andor for the purpose of assuring that the funds qualify as rics under subchapter m of the code the use of a whollyowned subsidiary in this limited context and for this limited purpose does not raise the concerns about undue influence layering of fees and complex structures that section d was designed to prevent applicants represent that  a fund is the sole and legal beneficial owner of its whollyowned subsidiary which addresses any concerns regarding pyramiding of voting control as a means of undue influence  the adviser or subadviser will manage the investments of both a fund and its whollyowned subsidiary thus further eliminating any concerns over undue influence by the adviser or subadviser  each fund is aware that its investment in a whollyowned subsidiary enables the fund to continue to qualify as a ric and  there is no inappropriate layering of fees and expenses as a result of a fund investing in a whollyowned subsidiary a fund or its respective master fund that invests in a whollyowned subsidiary will consolidate its financial statements with the whollyowned subsidiary’s financial statements provided that us gaap or other applicable accounting standards permit consolidation in assessing compliance with the asset coverage requirements under section f of the act a fund or its respective master fund will deem the assets liabilities and indebtedness of a whollyowned subsidiary in which the fund or its respective master fund invests as its own in addition the expenses of the whollyowned subsidiary are included in the total annual fund operating expenses in the prospectus of the relevant fund a whollyowned subsidiary may rely on sections c or c of the act to exempt it from registration as an investment company applicants note that certain etfs now trading have been operating under orders granting relief that is virtually identical to the fund of funds relief requested in this application applicants are not aware of any problems or difficulties encountered by such etfs or the mutual funds relying upon such orders and expect that the experience of the funds identified herein and fund of funds should be the same  exemption from the provisions of sections a and a applicants seek relief from section a to permit a fund that is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of a fund of funds to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds and to engage in the accompanying inkind transactions with the fund of funds  although applicants believe that most fund of funds will purchase shares in the secondary market and will not purchase creation units directly from a fund a fund of funds might seek to transact in creation units directly with a fund that is an affiliated person of a fund of funds to the extent that purchases and sales of shares occur in the secondary market and not through principal transactions directly between a fund of funds and a fund relief from section a would not be necessary however the requested relief would apply to direct sales of shares in creation units by a fund to a fund of funds and redemptions of those shares  section a of the act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between a registered investment company and any affiliated person of the company section a of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include any person  or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person a fund of funds relying on the requested order could own  or more of the outstanding voting securities of a fund and in such cases the fund would become an affiliated person of the fund of funds in light of this and other possible affiliations section a could prevent a fund from selling shares to and redeeming shares from a fund of funds section b of the act authorizes the commission to grant the order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section a if it finds that i the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved and iii the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act the commission has interpreted its authority under section b as extending only to a single transaction and not a series of transactions section c of the act permits the commission to exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act because a fund may engage in multiple transactions with a fund of funds applicants are seeking relief from any transaction in creation units between a fund and a fund of funds that owns  or more of a fund before the transaction as mentioned above applicants believe that most fund of funds will purchase shares in the secondary market and will not purchase creation units directly from a fund section a is intended to prohibit affiliated persons in a position of influence or control over an investment company from furthering their own interests by selling property that they own to an investment company at an inflated price purchasing property from an investment company at less than its fair value or selling or purchasing property on terms that involve overreaching by that person for the reasons articulated in the legal analysis of section d above applicants submit that with regard to section a the proposed transactions are appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and do not involve overreaching applicants anticipate that there may be a fund of funds that is not part of the same group of investment companies as the funds but may be subadvised by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser applicants are not seeking relief from section a for and the requested relief will not apply to transactions where a fund could be deemed an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of a fund of funds because the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser provides investment advisory services to that fund of funds applicants believe that an exemption is appropriate under sections b and c because the proposed arrangement meets the standards in those sections first the terms of the proposed arrangement are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching any consideration paid for the purchase or redemption of shares directly from a fund will be based on the nav of the fund in accordance with policies and procedures set forth in the fund’s registration statement second the proposed transactions directly between funds and fund of funds will be consistent with the policies of each fund of funds the purchase of creation units by a fund of funds will be accomplished in accordance with the investment restrictions of the fund of funds and will be consistent with the investment policies set forth in the fund of funds’ registration statement the fof participation agreement will require any fund of funds that purchases creation units directly from a fund to represent that the purchase of creation units from a fund by a fund of funds will be accomplished in compliance with the investment restrictions of  the fund of funds and will be consistent with the investment policies set forth in the fund of funds’ registration statement the proposed transactions also will be consistent with the policies of each fund third applicants believe that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the act applicants also believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest shares offer fund of funds a flexible investment tool that can be used for a variety of purposes applicants also submit that the exemption is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act v conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions a etf relief  the requested relief to permit etf operations other than the masterfeeder relief will expire on the effective date of any commission rule under the act that provides relief permitting the operation of index based etfs  as long as a fund operates in reliance on the requested order the shares of such fund will be listed on an exchange  neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised or marketed as an openend investment company or a mutual fund any advertising material that describes the purchase or sale of creation units or refers to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund and tender those shares for redemption to a fund in creation units only  the website which is and will be publicly accessible at no charge will contain on a per share basis for each fund the prior business day’s nav and the market closing price or the bidask price and a calculation of the premium or

under accounting procedures followed by each fund trades made on the prior business day “t” will be booked and reflected in nav on the current business day t accordingly the funds will be able to disclose at the beginning of the business day the portfolio that will form the basis for the nav calculation at the end of the business day  if the requested order is granted the adviser will include under item c of part  of its form adv a discussion of its relationship to any affiliated index provider and any material conflicts of interest resulting therefrom regardless of whether the affiliated index provider is a type of affiliate specified in item   in a masterfeeder structure the master fund rather than the feeder fund would invest its portfolio in compliance with the order there would be no ability by fund shareholders to exchange shares of feeder funds for shares of another feeder series of the master fund  a “to be announced transaction” or “tba transaction” is a method of trading mortgagebacked securities in a tba transaction the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency settlement date par amount and price the actual pools delivered generally are

strategies “ funds” or other longshort investment strategies “longshort funds” each longshort fund will establish i exposures equal to approximately  of the long positions specified by the longshort index as defined below and ii exposures equal to approximately  of the short positions specified by the longshort index each  fund will include strategies that i establish long positions in securities so that total long exposure represents approximately  of a fund’s net assets and ii simultaneously establish short positions in other securities so that total short exposure represents approximately  of such fund’s net assets  with respect to adrs the depository is typically a us financial institution and the underlying securities are issued by a foreign issuer the adr is registered under the securities act on form f adr trades occur either on an exchange or offexchange the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” rule  requires all offexchange transactions in adrs to be reported within  seconds and adr trade reports to be disseminated on a realtime basis with respect to gdrs the depository may be foreign or a us entity and the underlying securities may have a foreign or a us issuer all gdrs are sponsored and trade on a foreign exchange no affiliated person of a fund the adviser or any subadviser will serve as the depositary bank for any depositary receipts held by a fund

application a domestic index that is a  index is referred to as a “domestic  index” and a fund that seeks to track a domestic  index is referred to as a “domestic  fund” this same naming convention is applied to longshort funds and therefore a foreign index that is a longshort index is referred to as a “foreign longshort index” and a fund that seeks to track a foreign longshort index is referred to as a “foreign longshort fund” etc  the funds must comply with the federal securities laws in accepting deposit instruments and satisfying redemptions with redemption instruments including that the deposit instruments and redemption instruments are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the securities act in accepting deposit instruments and satisfying redemptions with redemption instruments that are restricted securities eligible for resale pursuant to rule a under the securities act the funds will comply with the conditions of rule a  the portfolio used for this purpose will be the same portfolio used to calculate the fund’s nav for that business day  a tradeable round lot for a security will be the standard unit of trading in that particular type of security in its primary market  this includes instruments that can be transferred in kind only with the consent of the original counterparty to the extent the fund does not intend to seek such consents  because these instruments will be excluded from the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments their value will be reflected in the determination of the cash amount defined below  a fund may only use sampling for this purpose if the sample i is designed to generate performance that is highly correlated to the performance of the fund’s portfolio ii consists entirely of instruments that are already included in the fund’s portfolio and iii is the same for all authorized participants on a given business day  in determining whether a particular fund will sell or redeem creation units entirely on a cash or inkind basis whether for a given day or a given order the key consideration will be the benefit that would accrue to the fund and its investors for instance in bond transactions the adviser may be able to obtain better execution than share purchasers because of the adviser’s size experience and potentially stronger relationships in the fixed income markets purchases of creation units either on an all cash basis or inkind are expected to be neutral to the funds from a tax perspective in contrast cash redemptions typically require selling portfolio holdings which may result in adverse tax consequences for the remaining fund shareholders that would not occur with an inkind redemption as a result tax considerations may warrant inkind redemptions  a “custom order” is any purchase or redemption of shares made in whole or in part on a cash basis in reliance on clause ei or eii  if the fund is rebalancing it may need to announce two estimated cash amounts for that day one for deposits and one for redemptions the instruments and cash that the purchaser is required to deliver in exchange for the creation units it is purchasing as described in section iii is referred to as the “portfolio deposit”  in a masterfeeder structure the transaction fees would be paid indirectly to the master fund applicants are not requesting relief from section  of the act accordingly a master fund may require a transaction fee payment to cover expenses related to purchases or redemptions of the master fund’s shares by a feeder fund only if it requires the same payment for equivalent purchases or redemptions by any other feeder fund thus for example a master fund may require payment of a transaction fee by a feeder fund for transactions for  or more shares so long as it requires payment of the same transaction fee by all feeder funds for transactions involving  or more shares  applicants note that shares of the fixed income funds typically will trade and settle on a trade date plus three business days “t” basis where this occurs applicants believe that shares of each fixed income fund will trade in the secondary market at prices that reflect interest and coupon payments on portfolio holdings through the shares’ t settlement date as with other investment companies the act requires the fixed income funds to calculate nav based on the current market value of portfolio investments and does not permit the fixed income funds to reflect in nav interest and coupon payments not due and payable therefore to the extent that shares of the fixed income funds may trade in the secondary market at a price that reflects interest and coupon payments due on a t settlement date applicants anticipate that such shares may trade in the secondary market at a slight premium to nav that reflects these interest and coupon payments applicants do not believe that this apparent premium will have any impact on arbitrage activity or the operations of the fixed income funds the market makers and other institutional investors who would take advantage of arbitrage activity have full access to this information and regularly consider such information when buying an individual bond or baskets of fixed income securities  feeder funds will redeem shares from the appropriate master fund and then deliver to the redeeming shareholder the applicable redemption payment  the requested exemption from section e would only apply to inkind redemptions by the feeder funds and would not apply to inkind redemptions by other feeder funds  nyse arca inc rules
