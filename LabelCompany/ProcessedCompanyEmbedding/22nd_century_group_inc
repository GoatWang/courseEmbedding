leading cigarette brands clinical studies have demonstrated that smokers who smoke very low nicotine “vln” cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco smoke fewer cigarettes per day resulting in significant reductions in smoke exposure including “tar” nicotine and carbon monoxide compensatory smoking does not occur with vln cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco hatsukami  et al  in a june   press release dr david kessler the former fda commissioner recommended that “the fda should quickly move to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels if we reduce the level of the stimulus we reduce the craving it is the ultimate harm reduction strategy” shortly thereafter in a  washington post  newspaper article dr kessler said that the amount of nicotine in a cigarette should drop from about  milligrams to less than  milligram brand a  contains approximately  milligrams of nicotine per cigarette a phase ii smoking cessation clinical trial at the university of minnesota masonic comprehensive cancer center hatsukami  et al  also measured exposure of various smoke compounds in smokers from smoking a vln cigarette containing our proprietary tobacco over a six week period smokers significantly reduced their smoking as compared to their usual brand of cigarettes the number of vln cigarettes smoked per day on average decreased from  the baseline number of cigarettes of smokers’ usual brand to  by the end of the six week period even though participants were instructed to smoke  ad libitum  as many cigarettes as desired during treatment furthermore besides significant reductions in other biomarkers carbon monoxide co levels an indicator of smoke exposure significantly decreased from  parts per million baseline to  parts per million cotinine a metabolite and biomarker of nicotine significantly decreased from  microgramsml baseline to  microgramsml all differences were statistically significant p a recently completed study led by the

the university of minnesota and queen mary university trials utilizing the results of these and other independent clinical trials we intend to submit to the center for tobacco products “ctp” of the fda an application for  brand a  as a modified risk cigarette we believe these and other results and future exposure studies the fda may require will result in a modified risk cigarette claim for  brand a we further believe smokers who desire to smoke fewer cigarettes per day while also satisfying cravings and reducing exposure to nicotine will find  brand a  beneficial there is however no

across a wide variety of productsmanagement team experienced and positioned to drive shareholder valuemarch th  is a big day for the tobacco industry the fda tobacco advisory panel meeting is set and will be discussing a slew of information including modified risk tobacco products as well as new statutory regulations nd century group inc nysemktxxii is uniquely positioned to be both small upstart disruptor as well as a key driving force across the entire smoking industry companies like philip morris nysepm altria group nysemo british american tobacco industries nysemktbti reynolds american nyserai and vector group nysevgr have all been positioning themselves in the ongoing pursuit of a reduced exposure tobacco product as well as into the emerging cannabishemp frontier pm has gone so far as to outright say they want to eliminate cigarettes altogether sort of unbelievable i know but evidence can be read here whether an attempt to push a new product line on the public or a sincere thought it is evident that philip morris is concerned and positioning themselves for a smokefree future btis own push for a shift into a sustainable business model can be found here as well rai was a step ahead of the game and came out with their attempt at a heat not burn hnb product that had a very small group of support in the end their  press release gave high praise to the product if one thing can be learned from previous attempts at the hnb products its that something is wrong from an exsmokers perspective the issue lies in the device and process itself smokers want to feel something when they are smoking they enjoy the throaty draw the feeling of the filter in their fingertips the sizzle as they inhale followed by the euphoric rush of nicotine into the blood stream lets face it heat not burn lacks in all categories the answer nd century groups very high nicotine vhn leaf the patented technology that xxii has allows them to essentially flip the switches of the genes of the plant to allow various levels of nicotine to be present if you combine the high potency nicotine leaf with the various contraptions marketed to be a healthier alternative you will undoubtedly find something that the consumer actually enjoys the nd century groups mission is to reduce the harm caused by smoking not only will the vhn product play a key role in unlocking the power of the hnb industries for the big tobacco groups but the proprietary technology also produces a very low nicotine vln leaf the vln product which is currently being studied and tested by numerous research groups including the fda and the center for tobacco products nysemktctp boasts a nicotine level less than that of a tomato xxii is currently in the late stages of development of its smoking cessation aide dubbed x info on the product can be found here as well as  published studies here the basis of the program that of which has been proven in the trials is a step down process that weans the users body off of the need for nicotine you begin with the average amount of nicotine to be found in a standard cigarette which is between  mg and slowly work your way down to the vln product which is a  mg product at  mg the level less than that of a tomato  ngg of nicotine studies have shown that the user gets just enough to be satisfied but not enough nicotine to become addicted again from an exsmokers perspective that is beyond words oh how i would have loved to have that product instead of cold turkey and withdrawal symptoms for the big tobacco players that are sitting in the march th advisory panel meeting where they will be discussing reduced exposure modified risk products and statutory regulations that technology is priceless the world health organization who has a tobacco free initiative aiming to put pressure on regulatory authorities to control and eliminate smoking if you havent been made aware you can also read about that here countries like new zealand who aims to eliminate smoking by  are joining the movement all around asia europe africa and the americas the push for regulation and more importantly a choice is grabbing hold not only does xxii hold the patents on the technology to make this possible it means they are the only entity able to produce products aimed at helping people quit as well as making smoking a choice not a need they arent seeking to just become the first company with an fda approved cessation product you actually smoke or a very low nicotine cigarette that can be marketed as such through the first ever modified risk tobacco product approval but they are shaking up the hemp and cannabis worlds as well through their wholly owned subsidiary botanical genetics they have had tremendous breakthroughs in the control of the cannabis plant along the same lines as nicotine levels the company is able to essentially flip the switches on and off of the various alkaloids that make up the cannabis plant to adjust the levels as needed by the end user the implications in this are massive as we move into a new revolution on the cannabis and hemp front in the recent years more than  states have now passed legislation allowing the cultivation of industrial hemp for commercial research andor pilot programs not to mention the  ballot initiatives that were passed making the long list of states allowing recreational and medical marijuana to become legal even longer again this is patent protected technology that xxii owns meaning they are the only company able to provide this service to researches industrial and commercial cultivators as well as the medical and recreational fields xxii is uniquely positioned to help both industries hemp and cannabis achieve fully legal status across our great nation by being the only company able to provide a  thc option proof of big tobaccos positioning into the cannabis and hemp world can be found easily in fact ill make it easy and offer this the article details pms m

products at the center for drug evaluation and research cder of the us food and drug administration fda regarding the company’s investigational new drug application ind for nd century’s xprescriptionbased smoking cessation product in development so that it may become available for doctors to prescribe to help their patients to stop smoking the meeting with the fdacder was very positive and productive fdacder and the company will work to reach agreement on the company’s design and implementation of two parallel phase iii clinical trials to be conducted by the company in various parts of the united states to show that the company’s xprescriptionbased smoking cessation product will result in a more robust quit rate in smoking as compared to existing smoking cessation products that are already in the market in the us the company believes that it will be able to achieve such robust results nd century group inc and the university of virginia launch a project for utilizing novel varieties of industrial hemp to clean up and reclaim abandoned mine lands and other polluted areas jun   nd century group inc announced that together with the university of virginia uva it has launched a project aimed at utilizing novel varieties of industrial hemp to clean up and reclaim abandoned mine lands and other polluted areas these polluted lands will be returned to productive use and cultivation through a costeffective plantbased process known as “phytoremediation” nd century has developed proprietary hemp plants that are particularly wellsuited for use in phytoremediation these plants feature rapid growth rates and are highly efficient at absorbing toxins metals and other soil contaminants similar varieties of hemp proved extremely effective in helping to remediate the land after the nuclear accidents at chernobyl ukraine and fukushima japan in addition to removing contamination hemp’s deep tap roots alter soil structure aerate the soil and add organic matter deep into the soil profile in the commonwealth of virginia and elsewhere throughout the appalachians coal mining and other environmentally damaging activities have left behind vast stretches of compacted polluted and generally untillable soil this summer researchers at uva and its affiliate uva at wise will begin testing industrial hemp varieties developed by the nd centuryuva partnership to improve soils in virginia because there are more than  sites that require soil remediation in the united states alone phytoremediation is expected to become a significant area of business for nd century uva and nd century will also investigate other uses of their phytoremediation hemp plants in virginia including the production of fiber oils and other high value products thus creating lucrative secondary markets for nd century based at the uvawise campus this landmark project reaches beyond conventional hemp remediation applications because uva and nd century are employing their combined biotechnology expertise to produce improved proprietary hemp varieties that are specifically designed for soil remediation such novel and powerful proprietary plants promise to become a

group incapr  about nd century xxii samuel rae currencies gold biotech healthcaresummaryreduced or low nicotine cigarettes are potentially an important part of the future of the tobacco industrythat the fda now controls the industry effectively makes for an uncertain regulatory landscape but one that will likely favor smoking cessation productsnd century group is one of the most prominent names in this area and its trying to do what vector group failed to do with its lead technologyits doing this with a second generation version meaning theres a chance it will succeed where vector failedits a risky allocation as financing through equity issue is almost an inevitability but if its brand a gets a regulatory green light theres plenty of reward on offer the reduced nicotine approach smoking cessation has been the subject of hot debate for the past ten years if a person smokes cigarettes that have a very low nicotine content this should theoretically reduce their dependence on nicotine and in turn their desire to smoke cigarettes for the purposes of this discussion were going to fall in line with the suggestion that its the nicotine thats the root of addiction and not alternative theories it sounds like a decent theory but there are plenty of counterpoints that opponents to the low nicotine content use to rebuke the implications of any such move smokers might consume more cigarettes in an attempt to compensate for the reduced persmoke amount the same smokers might oversmoke a cigarette which studies suggest can result in a threefold increase in the amount of tar inhaled per cigarette these counterpoints noted however theres a lot of evidence that suggests the reduced nicotine hypothesis is well founded heres one from  one from  and one from  these are university and cancer center conducted studies involving anything from  to  participants all of which have concluded that reducing the nicotine levels in a cigarette can reduce the number of cigarettes a person smokes across a predefined period of time andor result in an improved quit rate when used in conjunction with standard of care smoking cessation products as opposed to the latter on their own the most recent study in the field and the one generally regarded as a pivotal investigation into the matter was funded by the national institute on drug abuse nida and the us food and drug administration fda and conducted at the university of pittsburgh it was published in the new england journal of medicine in october  link and compared the impact of a very low nicotine product to a standard participants usual brand in cigarettes smoked and quit attempts the study concluded that participants in the active arm very low nicotine cigarettes smoked fewer cigarettes per day  than those in control  it also concluded that participants in the active arm doubled their quit attempts versus those in control again its important to note the limitations of this study oversmoking as described above is tough to qualify conclusively as is the potential for inaccurate participant selfreporting whatever the reality of the dispute the prevailing trend seems to fall in favor of the suggestion that reduced nicotine can be beneficial the socalled fda deeming rule which for those not familiar with it essentially handed over control to the fda over anything that contains nicotine reinforces this trend it came into force in august last year and the industry has been trying to forecast the impact of said rule ever since so by now readers are asking where were going with this well big tobacco has opposing views on the matter the abovementioned deeming rule is basically the completion of a rule that first hit press back in  on the back of an obama bill altria group inc nysemo supported it pretty much every other big player did not this means that there are companies that are willing to embrace the shift and indeed some read altria that are likely looking to get a jump on the competition because they know its just a matter of time before the fda mandates nicotine reduction so heres the point if the fda does mandate said reduction theres only one company that has the capability to grow tobacco plants that contain nicotine levels at or around the level reported by the who as being a threshold for causing addiction this company is nd century group inc nysemktxxii some reading might already be familiar with the name its fallen in and out of favor with markets at various points across the last seven years and a number of seeking alpha authors have expressed various and often opposing opinions as to its prospects for those new to the company however its a plant biotechnology company that has developed and patented a method of producing tobacco that contains the abovementioned below addiction threshold nicotine concentration well to be a little more accurate it was developed at north carolina state university on the back of a funding grant from joseph pandolfino nds founder it was then sublicensed to vector group ltd nysevgr with the goal of the latter developing a brand which it did called quest of low nicotine cigarettes and carrying the brand through an fda approval process so as to allow the company to market quest as a smoking cessation product it didnt work out that way vector conducted a phase ii study results here and then said it wasnt going to push for a phase iii nd century took vector to court got back the rights to the grow process and also won the rights to use the vectorgenerated data in its own fda submissions during this period nd century conducted a raft of its own studies funded by public institutions such as ncsu and refined its technology this is very important the technology that nd century relies on now and that for which it has a suite of patents is a socalled second generation technology this affords it certain advantages over the quest product that vector tried to market the company has taken this technology and produced a branded product called brand a which is the very low nicotine product on which the majority of its current valuation lies right now its trying to get the fda to approve it as a smoking cessation product by way of an application process that well look at shortly so the situation is this nd developed the technology with ncsu then licensed it to vector vector branded the quest product and tried to get it approved as a smoking cessation product vector didnt manage to do this and nd century spent the period in and around vectors abandoning of the product refining the technology in conjunction with again ncsu its now taken that refined technology used it to produce a second generation brand brand a and is trying to do what vector failed to do but with a superior product the company submitted a modified risk tobacco product mrtp application to the fda in an attempt to achieve this aim but received feedback earlier this year detailing the agencys requiring of more data to support the very low nicotine claim exactly what the agency wants remains unclear its rare we get much insight from either a company or the agency in these sorts of situations but we know that the resubmission needs to include additional scientific data and information from already completed clinical studies the implications of this working are then that nd century isnt going to have to conduct any more trials to support its application thats an assumption based on wording but its a reasonable one this is important because additional trials would require funding and the fewer shares the company has to issue between now and any potential regulatory green light the better regardless management has decided that on the back of the feedback its going to split the mrtp into two parts  a premarket tobacco product pmt application and a separate mrtp application the former is essentially an application that will allow the company to start selling the product but not label it as a smoking cessation aid and the time to approval on this is expected to be shorter than that of a combined submission the next major catalyst then is rooted in this application there was some concern among big tobacco that the fda taking control of the industry would result in the approval for sale of very few new tobacco products indeed theres some suggestion that the abovementioned support of the initial bill by altria was rooted in this concept  no or few new products would essentially monopolize the market for the existing brands whatever the reality the result of the pmt application will say a lot about how the fda views the low nicotine cigarette and specifically nd centurys brand a if it gets approval for sale it suggests that the agency deems it as potentially having a positive impact on the tobacco space from a health perspective this in turn suggests that nd century can get its mrtp approved even if it takes a little longer assuming it can provide the data the fda has requested to bolster the submission management initially stated that it expects to submit the revised and separate applications at some point this year in a recent letter to shareholders ceo henry sicignano refined this to a filing of both before the end of the first half of the year that means we should see submissions this quarter and serves up the potential for an approval of the pmt at least before the end of  if the pmt is approved the mrtp could should follow during  at which point nd century will become the only company in the us with an fda approved very low nicotine smoking cessation cigarette combine this with the industry trends outlined in the introduction to this piece and the evidence that supports the impact said type of cigarette can have on smoking habits and it paints the company as a potential winner how do things stand financially the latest report this k released march   put cash on hand at a little over  million at december   burn comes in at circa  monthly and management expects with these expectations supported by the just mentioned numbers current cash to last through may  theres the potential for up to  million in milestone payments based on a  licensing arrangement with british american tobacco plc bti which expires this coming october but the two companies have been tight lipped on how this is progressing andor will play out since information related to this agreement is thin on the ground its sensible to exclude the potential for milestone cash from any cash runway calculations revenues for the full year  hit  million up from  million in  and net loss for the two years in question came in pretty much unchanged at  million and  million respectively there are a couple of things to note here on these revenue figures management in its latest letter to shareholders outlined the fact that many of nd centurys shareholders would like to see the company reduce or even terminate the commercialization efforts it currently undertakes with a few of its legacy tobacco brands the reduction these holders argue would free up resources to focus on the pharmaceutical and regulatory side of things  a side that has the potential to dramatically outweigh the current commercial operations in terms of revenue generation again referencing the shareholder letter ceo sicignano suggested that the company was taking these shareholder opinions on board to a degree and he made reference to regulatory efforts in the uk as representative of this point this is important because chances are were not going to see any substantial rise in revenues over the coming year or two while the regulatory side of the operations take center stage the company in taking this approach is positioning itself more as a development stage biotechnology company in the sense that its focusing capital resources on bringing a product to market and running at a loss in anticipation of loss recovery once it picks up a regulatory green light this of course increases the risk of dilution biotechnology stocks need shareholder cash to get them over the regulatory line and this shift from commercial to regulatory focus increases the dilution an early position in nd century is going to have to withstand so on that note what are the risks well there are a few but the primary looks to be financing requirement we touched on the chances of nd century needing cash to fund any further data collection a little earlier and while this looks unlikely based on the fda response wording its an uncertainty and therefore a risk factor data collection aside nd century is almost certainly going to need to raise to fund operational expenses before it can hope to get its mrtp green light and then again to fund a commercial launch of its brand a product all of these issues are going to impact the value of a holding picked up near term this impact isnt necessarily prohibitive to an exposure but they need to be considered ahead of taking a position add in the fact that this is a small cap play reliant on an approval pathway that another company has already failed to traverse albeit with an inferior product and theres added uncertainty surrounding the potential for regulatory success and time to said success added time amplifies the primary financing risk all said however these are considered risks that come as part and parcel of a development stage healthcare or biotechnology company the upside potential is real if the regulatory and commercial elements of nd centurys pathway combine favorably and at its current valuation its not just real its very large looking at potential time frames the current applications with the fda probably wont come back approved in their entirety so were talking about both the pmt and the mrtp here before the end of  at this point the company can start to capitalize on the fda designation and start to bring in revenues as a cessation product of course crossreferencing this with the above capital requirement risk probably means were going to see a raise before may  which will bridge the gap to the applicationreturn catalyst and then a second raise
