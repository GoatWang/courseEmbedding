glasshelpful reviews pyo daniel j mdjerzy s ratedthis review pertains to drpyos surgery practice at the morristoown nj hospital not his private practice hence certain lack of info given by me on his staff office etcdr pyo pretty much literally saved my life i had a severe hip bone infection from a bed sore gone too far when i was on a threshold of sepsis he operated on me and amputated part of my hip bone at the very last moment on extremely short notice when all other surgeons refused to im a quadriplegic who is a long time smoker ive smoked since the age of  now  and unable to quit despite desperately and repeatedly trying and on medicaremedicaid every other surgeon ive seen at the time declined the surgery because they said that smokers only have a less than 0 chance of success following such a complicated procedure the infected part of bone is amputated then the thigh muscle is wrappedstapled or sewn around that space and they dont want to take that chance with medicaid the hospital on behalf of dr pyo after ive seen another physician from the same hospital and my case was apparently referred to dr pyo called me barely a week after my appointment and told me he wants me admitted and on the operating table asap within a couple of days it was done and he performed the procedure on me there were no postop complications whatsoever and his work healed and the flap wrap is holding up beautifully this was done in early july 0 and it is now midmay 0 i shall be forever grateful to dr pyo for doing this against all odds regardless of whether eventually that hip might become worse once again or not eventually given my deteriorating physical status as a long term quad im always at an ever increasing risk for such because thanks to him i got a new lease on life when everyone else myself included gave up on me and so is my mother btw who diligently transported me to various facilitiesappointments all over the tristate area seeking help for me until we finally came upon dr pyo from what i know drpyo also regularly takes some months off from his regular practice and travels to poorer countries performing pro bono reconstructive procedures correcting deformities et alia especially on afflicted children he might be a brilliant and talented plastic surgeon to many adults who simply require a beauty enhancement but as far as im concerned hes a remarkable human being as well with a great heart and soul thank you so very much doctor incidentally it is very difficult for me to type therefore ive typed this up straight from my heart and will copypaste into my
