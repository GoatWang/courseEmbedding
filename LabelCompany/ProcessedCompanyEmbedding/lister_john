edinburgh university college london alma mater university college london known for surgical sterile techniques notable awards royal medal  albert medal  copley medal  joseph lister st baron lister om pc prs  april  –  february  known between  and  as sir joseph lister bt was a british surgeon and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery he promoted the idea of sterile portable ports while working at the glasgow royal infirmary lister successfully introduced carbolic acid now known as phenol to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds applying louis pasteurs advances in microbiology lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic such that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery he first suspected it would prove an adequate disinfectant because it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste he presumed it was safe because fields treated with carbolic acid produced no apparent illeffects on the livestock that later grazed upon them listers work led to a reduction in postoperative infections and made surgery safer for patients distinguishing himself as the father of modern surgery contents  early life and education  career and work  surgical technique  later life  legacy and honours  see also  references  external links early life and educationedit lister came from a prosperous quaker home in west ham essex england a son of joseph jackson lister a pioneer of achromatic object lenses for the compound microscope at school he became a fluent reader of french and german a young joseph lister attended benjamin abbotts isaac brown academy a quaker school in hitchin since converted into the lord lister public house as a teenager lister attended grove house school tottenham studying mathematics natural science and languages joseph lister c  he attended university college london one of only a few institutions which accepted quakers at that time he initially studied botany and obtained a bachelor of arts degree in  he registered as a medical student and graduated with honours as bachelor of medicine subsequently entering the royal college of surgeons at the age of  in  lister became both first assistant to and friend of surgeon james syme at the university of edinburgh edinburgh royal infirmary in scotland there he joined the royal medical society and presented two dissertations in  and  which are still in the possession of the society today he subsequently left the quakers joined the scottish episcopal church and eventually married symes daughter agnes on their honeymoon they spent  months visiting leading medical institutes hospitals and universities in france and germany by this time agnes was enamoured of medical research and was listers partner in the laboratory for the rest of her life career and workedit lister with fellow residents at the old royal infirmary edinburgh c lister is in the front row with his hands clasped before listers studies of surgery most people believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air was responsible for infections in wounds hospital wards were occasionally aired out at midday as a precaution against the spread of infection via miasma but facilities for washing hands or a patients wounds were not available a surgeon was not required to wash his hands before seeing a patient because such practices were not considered necessary to avoid infection despite the work of ignaz semmelweis and oliver wendell holmes sr hospitals practiced surgery under unsanitary conditions surgeons of the time referred to the good old surgical stink and took pride in the stains on their unwashed operating gowns as a display of their experience while he was a professor of surgery at the university of glasgow lister became aware of a paper published by the french chemist louis pasteur showing that food spoilage could occur under anaerobic conditions if microorganisms were present pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the microorganisms responsible filtration exposure to heat or exposure to solutionchemical solutions lister confirmed pasteurs conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds as the first two methods suggested by pasteur were dangerous and unsafe for the treatment of human tissue lister experimented with the third idea lister spraying phenol over patient in  friedlieb ferdinand runge discovered phenol also known as carbolic acid which he derived in an impure form from coal tar at that time there was uncertainty between the substance of creosote – a chemical that had been used to treat wood used for railway ties and ships since it protected the wood from rotting – and carbolic acid upon hearing that creosote had been used for treating sewage lister began to test the efficacy of carbolic acid when applied directly to wounds joseph lister in his youth therefore lister tested the results of spraying instruments the surgical incisions and dressings with a solution of carbolic acid lister found that the solution swabbed on wounds remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene in august  lister applied a piece of lint dipped in carbolic acid solution onto the wound of a sevenyearold boy at glasgow infirmary who had sustained a compound fracture after a cart wheel had passed over his leg after four days he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed and after a total of six weeks he was amazed to discover that the boys bones had fused back together without the danger of suppuration he subsequently published his results in the lancet in a series of six articles running from march through july  he instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands before and after operations with  carbolic acid solutions instruments were also washed in the same solution and assistants sprayed the solution in the operating theatre one of his additional suggestions was to stop using porous natural materials in manufacturing the handles of medical instruments lister left glasgow in  returning to edinburgh as successor to syme as professor of surgery at the university of edinburgh and continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis amongst those he worked with there who helped him and his work was the senior apothecary and later md dr alexander gunn listers fame had spread by then and audiences of  often came to hear him lecture as the germ theory of disease became more understood it was realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place this led to the rise of less primitive surgery on the anniversary of his death in  lister was considered by most in the medical field as the father of modern surgery surgical techniqueedit lister moved from scotland to kings college hospital in london in  he was elected president of the clinical society of london he also developed a method of repairing kneecaps with metal wire and improved the technique of mastectomy later lifeedit listers hearse prior to his funeral service at westminster abbey london lister retired from

medal  joseph lister st baron lister om pc prs  april  –  february  known between  and  as sir joseph lister bt was a british surgeon and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery he promoted the idea of sterile portable ports while working at the glasgow royal infirmary lister successfully introduced carbolic acid now known as phenol to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds applying louis pasteurs advances in microbiology lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic such that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery he first suspected it would prove an adequate disinfectant because it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste he presumed it was safe because fields treated with carbolic acid produced no apparent illeffects on the livestock that later grazed upon them listers work led to a reduction in postoperative infections and made surgery safer for patients distinguishing himself as the father of modern surgery

quaker home in west ham essex england a son of joseph jackson lister a pioneer of achromatic object lenses for the compound microscope at school he became a fluent reader of french and german a young joseph lister attended benjamin abbotts isaac brown academy a quaker school in hitchin since converted into the lord lister public house as a teenager lister attended grove house school tottenham studying mathematics natural science and languages joseph lister c  he attended university college london one of only a few institutions which accepted quakers at that time he initially studied botany and obtained a bachelor of arts degree in  he registered as a medical student and graduated with honours as bachelor of medicine subsequently entering the royal college of surgeons at the age of  in  lister became both first assistant to and friend of surgeon james syme at the university of edinburgh edinburgh royal infirmary in scotland there he joined the royal medical society and presented two dissertations in  and  which are still in the possession of the society today he subsequently left the quakers joined the scottish episcopal church and eventually married symes daughter agnes on their honeymoon they spent  months visiting leading medical institutes hospitals and universities in france and germany by this time agnes was enamoured of medical research and was listers partner in the laboratory for the rest of her life career and workedit lister with fellow residents at the old royal infirmary edinburgh c lister is in the front row with his hands clasped before listers studies of surgery most people believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air was responsible for infections in wounds hospital wards were occasionally aired out at midday as a precaution against the spread of infection via miasma but facilities for washing hands or a patients wounds were not available a surgeon was not required to wash his hands before seeing a patient because such practices were not considered necessary to avoid infection despite the work of ignaz semmelweis and oliver wendell holmes sr hospitals practiced surgery under unsanitary conditions surgeons of the time referred to the good old surgical stink and took pride in the stains on their unwashed operating gowns as a display of their experience while he was a professor of surgery at the university of glasgow lister became aware of a paper published by the french chemist louis pasteur showing that food spoilage could occur under anaerobic conditions if microorganisms were present pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the microorganisms responsible filtration exposure to heat or exposure to solutionchemical solutions lister confirmed pasteurs conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds as the first two methods suggested by pasteur were dangerous and unsafe for the treatment of human tissue lister experimented with the third idea lister spraying phenol over patient in  friedlieb ferdinand runge discovered phenol also known as carbolic acid which he derived in an impure form from coal tar at that time there was uncertainty between the substance of creosote – a chemical that had been used to treat wood used for railway ties and ships since it protected the wood from rotting – and carbolic acid upon hearing that creosote had been used for treating sewage lister began to test the efficacy of carbolic acid when applied directly to wounds joseph lister in his youth therefore lister tested the results of spraying instruments the surgical incisions and dressings with a solution of carbolic acid lister found that the solution swabbed on wounds remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene in august  lister applied a piece of lint dipped in carbolic acid solution onto the wound of a sevenyearold boy at glasgow infirmary who had sustained a compound fracture after a cart wheel had passed over his leg after four days he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed and after a total of six weeks he was amazed to discover that the boys bones had fused back together without the danger of suppuration he subsequently published his results in the lancet in a series of six articles running from march through july  he instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands before and after operations with  carbolic acid solutions instruments were also washed in the same solution and assistants sprayed the solution in the operating theatre one of his additional suggestions was to stop using porous natural materials in manufacturing the handles of medical instruments lister left glasgow in  returning to edinburgh as successor to syme as professor of surgery at the university of edinburgh and continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis amongst those he worked with there who helped him and his work was the senior apothecary and later md dr alexander gunn listers fame had spread by then and audiences of  often came to hear him lecture as the germ theory of disease became more understood it was realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place this led to the rise of less primitive surgery on the anniversary of his death in  lister was considered by most in the medical field as the father of modern surgery surgical techniqueedit lister moved from scotland to kings college hospital in london in  he was elected president of the

between the substance of creosote – a chemical that had been used to treat wood used for railway ties and ships since it protected the wood from rotting – and carbolic acid upon hearing that creosote had been used for treating sewage lister began to test the efficacy of carbolic acid when applied directly to wounds joseph lister in his youth therefore lister tested the results of spraying instruments the surgical incisions and dressings with a solution of carbolic acid lister found that the solution swabbed on wounds remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene in august  lister

danger of suppuration he subsequently published his results in the lancet in a series of six articles running from march through july  he instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands before and after operations with  carbolic acid solutions instruments were also washed in the same solution and assistants sprayed the solution in the operating theatre one of his additional suggestions was to stop using porous natural materials in manufacturing the handles of medical instruments lister left glasgow in  returning to edinburgh as successor to syme as

antiseptics  dressings company issued in  during ww ii this item is hand signed by the company�s director and managing agent and is over  years oldthe two perhaps most important contributions to antiseptic procedures in the medical arts both happened during the last  years the french chemist and microbiologist louis pasteur set the stage for the later appearance of british surgeon john lister who pioneered antiseptic operating room procedures and after whom missouri physician joseph lawrence named his antibacterial mouth wash in a time when surgeons operated in their street clothes surrounded by similarly clothed and septic onlookers and just after surgical instruments were finally being washed in soapy water between operations lister campaigned for heat or chemical sterilization and for surgeons to use something other than sawdust swept up from the floors of the mills used in surgical dressings product  lisandrescomnormal price our sales price  you save qty
