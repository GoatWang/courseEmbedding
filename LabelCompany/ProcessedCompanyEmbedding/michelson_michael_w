christopher edward jonesmmrf in action dr gary k michelson has this year been awarded the albert b sabin humanitarian award in recognition of his significant and continual efforts to combat global health issues funding provided by dr michelson has in recent years supported numerous research programmes allowing the progression of both labbased vaccine development and vaccine advocacy and education at a global governmental level in a presentation ceremony held at the sabin vaccine institute dr peter j hotez president of the institute and dean for the national school of tropical medicine spoke of his admiration for dr gary k michelson whom he described as a man striving towards “humanitarian goals” meanwhile michael w marine ceo of the sabin institute claimed the institute felt “very fortunate” to have dr michelson’s support in their mission to create “a world free of needless human suffering from vaccinepreventable and neglected tropical diseases” neglected tropical diseases or ntds have been a central focus of the programmes funded by dr michelson ntds primarily affect the most impoverished and vulnerable populations on earth and have a devastating impact upon global human health however due to lack of awareness amongst governing bodies the vulnerability of affected populations and lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies and private research institutes global response to the growing problem of ntds has been slow and lacking one particularly successful programme which dr michelson has funded is the ntd special envoy programme which approaches the problem of ntds from a political perspective by raising global awareness of ntds and encouraging proactivity from world governments the initiative reaches out to countries where ntds are endemic offering encouragement and support and also reaches out to g and g2 countries to promote a global response from the world’s wealthiest and most powerful governments and coalitions the latest special envoy for the global network dr mirta roses periago travelled to canada in the fall of  to meet with government officials making a strong call for canadian policymakers to add ntds as a component to their development efforts emphasizing the linkages to maternal newborn and child health – including malnutrition – the primary focus for canada’s development policy dr roses was also key alongside the ngo effecthope in ensuring that canadian officials raised the ntds issue during a highly publicized meeting between prime minister stephen harper and ntds advocate bill gates this led to

be raised during the june  g summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel photo credit world health organization the effectiveness and successes of the programme led to ntds being a heavily discussed subject at the g summit in june this year during the summit all g countries made a “firm commitment to advance the fight against ntds and to alleviate the misery of vulnerable and neglected populations” this commitment will manifest as monetary investment in both “prevention and control efforts” and “research and development” in the area of ntds many g countries have independently taken considerable concrete steps towards creating programmes aimed at combatting ntds the canadian government this year announced  million funding for a project aiming to limit the impact of ntds in north africa the funding recipient an ngo named effecthope will aim to prevent the spread of ntds in côted’ivoire and kenya by delivering deworming treatments and vitamin a tablets to children under the age of  meanwhile japan has also shown a commitment to eliminating ntds with the japanese agency for medical research and development agreeing to fund the international joint research program to address ntds in africa the  million initiative aims to encourage researchers in african countries to conduct research into ntds building upon the work of japanese researchers implementation structure – international joint research program to address neglected tropical diseases in africa japanese agency for medical research implementation structure – international joint research program to address neglected tropical diseases in africa japanese agency for medical research implementation structure – international joint research program to address neglected tropical diseases in africa japanese agency for medical research implementation structure – international joint research program to address neglected tropical diseases in africa japanese agency for medical research during the award ceremony michael w marine referenced these significant successes by describing the “gamechanging impact” that dr michelson has had in “bringing ntds to the consciousness of global decision makers” it is hoped that with the support of dr michelson sustainable and meaningful progress towards easing the global burden of ntds will continue as with over  billion people across over  endemic countries currently at risk of being infected it is clear that progress is desperately necessary to provide neglected populations with relief and protection from these debilitating diseases gary k michelson
