stan horton stanley c horton thank you molly and good morning everyone i hope youve had a chance to review the earnings press release that we issued this morning in addition to reporting earnings we also announced a quarterly distribution of  cents per unit or  annualized jamie will review the results of the quarter shortly in the second quarter we continued to make progress on executing our growth strategy on may  we announced that we had formalized our joint venture with williams to continue the development of the bluegrass pipeline and related fractionation and storage assets including a potential new lpg terminal as discussed in our last earnings call the bluegrass pipeline is designed to transport marcellus and utica mixed ngl production to growing petrochemical markets in the us gulf coast the pipeline is proposed to be connected to a new ngl fractionation facility named the moss lake fractionation which would be constructed at our sulphur hub in the lake charles area as well as a new ngl storage facilities were also exploring development of a new lpg export terminal that would be named the moss lake lpg terminal at this stage together with williams we are meeting with customers about the project and anticipate an open season for the project later this year there are  segments of the proposed bluegrass pipeline construction of the pipeline from the marcellus utica shale basins to an interconnection with texas gas at hardinsburg kentucky conversion of a portion of texas gas that represents approximately  miles of pipeline from hardinsburg to eunice louisiana and construction of a pipeline from eunice to our sulphur hub in the lake charles louisiana area on may  we filed with the federal energy regulatory commission for the abandonment authority to begin the conversion process of approximately  miles in natural gas pipeline to ngl service the joint venture structure with williams is anticipated to be  the agreement also contemplates different scenarios under which both boardwalk and williams may adjust their ownership positions in the project these scenarios will be a evaluated as we proceed through the development of the project if all conditions are met the targeted inservice date is late  now to our other projects our  million  million cubic feet a day southeast market expansion project is on schedule and currently in the environmental assessment process at the federal energy regulatory commission we expect construction to commence in the first half of  within the expected inservice date of late  the flag city gas processing plant commenced operations in the second quarter and the construction was completed within budget we have completed the leaching of the salt dome cavern expansion at petal and will begin shortly injecting the base gas into the cavern which has approximately  billion cubic feet of working gas capacity the total working gas capacity at the petal gas storage assets including this expansion is fully contracted were also proceeding as planned with  pipeline projects that will support electric power generation loads on our system construction of the  million cubic feet project in north texas is scheduled to begin this quarter with an anticipated inservice date in the first quarter of  the  million cubic feet project in the mississippi river corridor in louisiana is already under construction with a targeted inservice date in the fourth quarter of this year these  projects have a combined cost of approximately  million construction is nearly complete on the  million choctaw brine project and we anticipate that this project will be placed in service in the third quarter so its been a busy quarter we are pleased with the progress we are making in executing our strategy to grow and diversify the company through new projects and by optimizing the use of existing assets that concludes my comments on this quarter and i will turn the call now over to jamie jamie l buskill thank you stan and good morning everyone operating revenues for the second quarter were  million which is  million or  higher than the comparable period in  the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues of  million from our acquisition of blm offset primarily by a reduction in our transportation revenues related to contract renewals and lower utilization driven by unfavorable market conditions and mild weather for the second quarter we transported  tbtu of natural gas and  million barrels of liquids turning now to operating expenses we reported operating expenses of  million for the quarter an increase of  million or  from  million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of boardwalk louisiana midstream and higher fuel costs the higher fuel costs were offset by higher revenues from fuel as both were driven by higher natural gas prices excluding boardwalk louisiana midstream ag and om expenses were favorable during the quarter we recorded a gain of approximately  million primarily related to the disposition of base gas adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million an increase of  million or  from  million for the comparable period in  net income for the quarter was  million an increase of  million or  from  million for the comparable period last year both adjusted ebitda and net income were impacted by the items previously discussed we generated  million of distributable cash for the quarter this compares to  million generated in the second quarter of  an increase of  as of june  outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were  million with an available borrowing capacity of  million in may we issued approximately  million units that provided net proceeds of approximately  million which was used primarily to pay down our revolver debttoebitda for the  months ended june  was x compared with x for the  months ended june   regarding bluegrass we have entered into arrangements with a subsidiary of loews corporation to invest in the bluegrass project under which they will fund  of the preconstruction costs and we will fund the remaining  we estimate that the preconstruction costs to be invested under this arrangement will be approximately  million of which approximately  million is expected to be funded in  so in  we estimate that boardwalks capital expenditures for bluegrass will total approximately  million we anticipate growth capital expenditures related to previously announced projects including our portion of bluegrass will be approximately  million  or im sorry  million in  of which  million has been invested through the second quarter maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be  million of which  million has been invested through the second quarter that concludes my remarks ill now turn the call over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from darren horowitz raymond james darren horowitz  raymond james  associates inc research division a couple of quick questions for you on bluegrass has anything changed from a scale scope or timing perspective do you guys still expect the abandonment process to take somewhere between  to  months and how do you envision the timing around the antitrust clearance stanley c horton let me talk first to the abandonment process the schedule that we outlined previously is the one that we still feel that we can meet based upon the comments that we got with our customers there is not a lot of intervention from our customers in it so that timing is good on the antitrust we dont perceive any issues with the antitrust there so the timing and the scope that weve laid out previously is pretty much unchanged darren horowitz  raymond james  associates inc research division okay and then from a capital funding perspective i appreciate the color on the  commitment can you give us at least your early expectation of how the capital commitment could be throughout the course of  and  stanley c horton no we really cant at this point in time we have not sat down with our general partner and talked about anything past  a lot of decisions have to be made at the end of the year and well do that in due time darren horowitz  raymond james  associates inc research division okay so just to be clear the  million that you will be funding that represents your  and the remaining  obviously would be loews and that in aggregate is  of the overall project cost at least at this point for full year  jamie l buskill thats correct the total funding for our  will be  million of which loews will be funding  of and well be funding  and of the  million were anticipating that we will fund this year  million of that has been funded through the end of the second quarter so basically were done funding for the remainder of the year darren horowitz  raymond james  associates inc research division okay but from a bluegrass aggregate perspective i guess total funding for the project itself should be about  million this year is that correct jamie l buskill that is correct darren horowitz  raymond james  associates inc research division okay and then last question for me jamie just from a housekeeping perspective obviously maintenance capex has been tracking below what a lot of us have been modeling for the past couple of quarters in terms of achieving that  million mark is that going to be split evenly between the third and the fourth quarter or is it going to be a bit more lumpy jamie l buskill its hard to say at this point i think thats a fair way of looking at it is an even split for the third and fourth quarter operator our next question is from mark reichman of simmons mark l reichman  simmons  company international research division its several questions first the mention of the moss lake lpg terminal can you elaborate a little bit on the capacity and what particular products and maybe the split between the products that will be exported stanley c horton the absolute size of the terminal has not been finalized so i hesitate to put out a number there so far its the products that wed be looking at going through there propanes butanes that  those products mark l reichman  simmons  company international research division okay so  and what would be the  what would  remind me on the timing stanley c horton the timing would be pretty much the same as the inservice date of the pipeline the latter part of  mark l reichman  simmons  company international research division  okay and then also wasnt there a mention  it made mention of the potential for a fractionation plant are you able to speak to that in terms of the plans there stanley c horton yes i think i mentioned in my remarks that basically theres  projects that were looking at the bluegrass pipeline project the moss lake fractionation and storage project and the possibility of the moss lake lpg terminal so the frac and storage project  the fractionator would be a barreladay fractionation facility as currently contemplated mark l reichman  simmons  company international research division okay great and then lastly on the transportation revenues this quarter that were impacted by the contract renewals and the lower utilization can you provide just a little more detail by system relative to the prior year period where you experienced the largest impacts jamie l buskill no were not going to get into breaking down by each pipeline because when we manage it we really manage it at a boardwalk level and thats how we manage it internally and if you look at the quarter we were down about  million from contract renewals which is in line with the expectations we laid out for the last  earnings calls where we estimate well be down about  million this year from those renewals operator our next question is from stephen maresca morgan stanley stephen j maresca  morgan stanley research division on the  you mentioned stan on the jv  can you describe some of these scenarios you talked about the percents could change between you and williams does one have the right to make that change or do both need to agree to change that percent stanley c horton both parties have rights under the agreement and  excuse me at this stage we really dont want to go into the details of what those individual rights are of each company but both companies do have rights with respect to ownership of the various projects as we go through stephen j maresca  morgan stanley research division okay is it  is this something where speaking for you and the company you would want to own more of this if you could or is there something you think you could do over time stanley c horton i hate to get into whatif scenarios at the  were out trying to get market commitments right now and these market commitments hopefully will support us moving forward with the project moving forward with the timing at the beginning of next year and both williams and boardwalk would be very satisfied with the market commitments that we got and we move forward as we currently contemplate so thats what both companies are hoping and well go from there stephen j maresca  morgan stanley research division okay and jamie you mentioned the subsidiary funding  of preconstruction costs and you guys are doing the  going forward is that something we should be thinking about in terms of how this will play out where you guys will fund a smaller part initially even as it starts to construct and then indiscernible up in the air at that point jamie l buskill well i think its premature to try to estimate what might happen beyond this preliminary construction phase as stan mentioned earlier well provide additional color as the year develops and we get more definition to the project stanley c horton let me make it clear theres no agreement between boardwalk and loews having to do with funding of the project after december of next year at the right time well sit down and discuss that but there is no agreement between us stephen j maresca  morgan stanley research division okay and then my final question just as it relates to the distribution and thoughts about raising it at a few standard jamie what would you like to see before you think about starting to raise it again is it completion of a project like this or maybe just some thoughts around that jamie l buskill well again were not going to talk to the future as far as what may happen to our distribution thats really up to our board at the end of the day but i think just running the business and looking at the results our strategy has been and continues to be as stan mentioned to optimize our existing assets and to look at acquisitions that help us diversify and grow the company and i think youve seen that over the last couple of years weve still got quite a bit of work to do obviously projects like the bluegrass project could be a very good project to us but im not going to sit here and try to project what impact that may or may not have on our distribution stanley c horton weve said a couple of times that theres a myriad of things that go into looking at recommending to our board about what the appropriate dividend is how our base business is performing the projects that we have on the drawing board looking at coverage ratios looking at debttoebitda ratios looking at financing requirements that we have to do i mean theres a myriad of stuff that goes in it and not just one project and those are all the things that we look at when we give our recommendations to the board operator our next question is from christine cho barclays christine cho  barclays capital research division just some questions on your lpg terminal i suspect that you andor williams already have existing water access have you added to this access in anticipation of bluegrass and is what you have enough or do you wait for results from the open season before going out and buying some stanley c horton let me just say that the project is in the preliminary developmental stage and all aspects of the project are being looked at and secured and once we get the customer commitments we will be in a position to move forward with the terminal subject to both boards approving it so all the things that need to be looked at during the developmental stage are being be looked at and  to make sure that weve got everything that we need to proceed with the project to the extent that we get the right market commitments and the requisite board approvals christine cho  barclays capital research division okay and then i just have one kind of accounting question the  million gain recognized on the sale of storage base gas ive seen this pop up every so often and im just curious if you could add some more color to it just because from what i understand you need the base gas to maintain the integrity of the system but i think last year it came up a number of times so just kind of what is this exactly and how much more of this can you do jamie l buskill well if you look as you said through the years since weve been a public company weve had this  these gains quite often and its really a function of looking at our system looking at the services were provided and thats not a constant those are constantly moving and so we analyze our system and when opportunities create themselves where we no longer need to own the base gas its beneficial for us to sell it and its beneficial in a couple ways one normally this gas has a very low basis so it frees up cash that can be invested into other parts of the business and secondly it creates capacity for other services in this case we sold  bcf of gas a base gas which now creates opportunity for us to use that capacity for other storage or park and lend services so were constantly monitoring the system its hard to say if therell be any future opportunities because systems are always changing but thats something were constantly analyzing stanley c horton yes let me add a little bit more color to that youre correct in that theres a certain amount of gas that needs to be in the reservoir to maintain pressures but its not necessarily gas that we have to own so to the extent that we can do a park and lend service that stretches across our winter season and that weve got the molecules in the storage facility that works as well as gas that we own our storage facility doesnt recognize who owns the gas so as long as were maintaining the integrity of the storage facility and the integrity of meeting our perm ph loads there are options that weve got on how we do that and from time to time as we look at it there are opportunities for us to convert some of that into pal service by selling some of the base gas recognizing a gain and then also having the additional capacity to sell this pad how much we have to do we analyze that all the time so thats what we are comfortable doing in this quarter not sure whether well do anymore at the end of the year it just kind of all depends on a number of factors operator our next question is from sharon lui wells fargo sharon lui  wells fargo securities llc research division so i guess going back in terms of the preconstruction funding by loews is that for  in exchange for i guess a percentage interest or is boardwalk just obligated to reimburse for all the costs with interest at a certain point in time jamie l buskill its for a percent we are not obligated to reimburse for anything its  in some ways loews has helped in the past on transactions and acquisitions and you may recall in those prior deals there were no obligations to either drop down or to buyback or do anything like that its something that we analyze and if it made sense to drop down assets we did at that time at this point the  thats their  thats loews ownership of our share of the joint venture with williams and we will own  and how that progresses well be able to discuss more to that as the project develops and time goes on stanley c horton weve always said one of the strengths of boardwalk is the support we get from our gp and this is just another example of the kind of support that we get from loews from time to time on these projects sharon lui  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and that would cover costs extending through the end of next year is that what you said before stanley c horton yes sharon lui  wells fargo securities llc research division okay great and then i guess in terms of the lpg export facility as contemplated would you have the same amount of capacity as the pipe meaning  barrels stanley c horton no because not all of the product that moves through the pipe would be product that would be exported as i said before the size of the lpg export facility will be based upon the market commitments we get but those will just be products like propanes and butanes they wouldnt be the ethanes that would be exported sharon lui  wells fargo securities llc research division do you have a capacity in mind right now stanley c horton as i said again the facility can be sized based upon the commitments that we get from the customers and once we get those commitments then well build it to size so we dont have a number that we want to release right now jamie l buskill yes sharon one thing i do want to clarify is that the agreement with loews its really not datespecific as it is dollarspecific we  that arrangement is for the preconstruction costs which is estimated to be  million most of those costs will be incurred this year were anticipating  million of that  million will be through the end of this year so its not really datespecific as it is dollarspecific sharon lui  wells fargo securities llc research division okay thats helpful and my last question is just in terms of an update on what youre seeing for processing volumes and commitments for the flag city facility stanley c horton yes ill talk to that as youre aware  of the capacity of the plant is sold out under longterm contracts to talisman and statoil right now today we are moving and have moved since the plant went in service some interruptible volumes through the plant we contemplate that we would continue to do that from time to time and we have some negotiations going on for a longerterm firm contract that hopefully will come to fruition soon so thats kind of where we are on the plant operator our next question is from matt niblack hite matt niblack just a clarification question on the bluegrass terms with your parent so you said that they will have  ownership of the product  of the project commensurate with their investment in the preconstruction costs just wanted to understand was that the entire project or was that just the general statement that the  their ownership will be proportional to their investment and then how does the existing pipeline asset thats being modified that sits at boardwalk figure into that division of interest jamie l buskill yes first of all the only thing were talking about in these cost estimates and the sharing of that funding with loews is these preliminary construction costs which is  million now if you look through the second quarter as i mentioned earlier we have already funded  million or basically our  so when you look at the end of the quarter boardwalk actually owns roughly  of the investment and loews will own  since loews will be funding the remainder of the investment  of that preliminary cost investment their ownership will grow to  again once we get more clarity on this project and we can talk to that then we can provide additional color of what may happen after the preliminary costs so everything is really just getting us up to the construction phase matt niblack okay but then what value is being assigned to the existing asset thats being worked on is that  as it pertains to dividing up this interest it sounds like the value is  based on what you just said jamie l buskill im not sure i understand the question theres  at this point its preliminary construction costs so theres been no assets moved its really just engineering work and survey work and the things you typically do in a constructiontype project so theres really  theres not any physical assets in these numbers to speak of its again preliminary type construction work stanley c horton the texas gas facilities that are to be abandoned cannot be contributed to the partnership until an abandonment application is received from the federal energy regulatory commission so there has been no transfer of the texas gas assets over to this project yet matt niblack okay thats helpful and then are you comfortable with the current sort of close to  debttoebitda level or is that something that youll be looking to more proactively bring down over the coming months jamie l buskill were pleased with the progress weve made actually if you looked at  its a little lower than that because you only have  quarters of boardwalk louisiana midstream in your numbers at this point but our target has been all along is wed like to be in the low s so were happy where were seeing things and we hope to continue to make progress there operator our next question is from yves siegel neuberger berman yves c siegel  neuberger berman management llc so just to be clear before the open season or  and before you actually get the results of the open season it sounds like williams and boardwalk will be spending  million is that the right way to think about that i mean jamie l buskill we are  well were incurring costs today weve yet to have the open season as stan mentioned we  the open season we hope to have that kicked off in the second half of the year and so yes most of these costs are going to be incurred before you close that open season but it may not be all yves c siegel  neuberger berman management llc okay and so sort of a back way for me to say that you folks might  must have a high degree of confidence to be committing as much capital as you are that therell be a positive outcome im not sure if that was a question or just waiting for you to see if you had any comment on that stanley c horton i wasnt sure whether it was a question or not weve said this before weve been pleased with the reaction that we have gotten from customers that weve gone out and talked to weve been pleased with the reception that weve gotten in the marketplace but the proof is in the pudding when you can go sign contracts so hopefully by the end of the year well have those and we can announce that were moving forward so in the meantime there are a lot of development costs that need to be spent to make sure that we can hit that projected inservice date yves c siegel  neuberger berman management llc okay and not to belabor the point but the second question is you have plenty of capacity under your revolver at the end of the second quarter why did you need loews to come in at this juncture jamie l buskill well i think at this point you really have the negative carry aspects of the preliminary costs and it is quite a bit of money as you pointed out and we just thought that was a good arrangement for boardwalk and now i might add on the revolver subsequent to the end of the quarter we have paid that  million off so as we stand today that  we basically have the full revolver available to us plus well do another project to use if you look at our capital spend were going to spend  million this year on expansion projects only  million of that is bluegrassrelated so we have quite a bit of other projects were working on and we continue to explore other opportunities outside of bluegrass stanley c horton i guess the way that i would put it here loews has offered to fund  of the development costs if for some reason the project did not go loews loses most of the money not boardwalk so were somewhat insulated from that theyre taking the development risk on the project and as the ceo of boardwalk i think that is a great deal for boardwalk and my unitholders so when that deal was offered to me ill take that deal any time yves c siegel  neuberger berman management llc well done stan and then the last question i have is  well  questions one is whats the acquisition landscape look like from your perspective stanley c horton i would say that based upon everything that we see out there right now its a fairly robust market there seem to be quite a few assets for sale right now so its a pretty robust market then im just talking on kind of the macro level not boardwalk there seem to be a lot out there for sale yves c siegel  neuberger berman management llc okay and then the last question how would you characterize the recontracting as we move into  from a perspective is the worst behind us in terms of the duration and revenues from the recontracting stanley c horton i dont want to say the worst is behind us but on the recontracting as jamie had said before the average length of our contract has been about  years of course as you move through and recontract something hopefully when that renewal comes up therell be no further deterioration so every year we seem to work out a little bit more of the problem but we have a few years to go on recontracts that our ad rates today that are higher than the current basis now that being said we are very hopeful that as demand continues to increase that some of these basis differentials will continue to get better so well just have to see what the market gives us but when you start looking at the lpg terminals that are going to be coming on we start looking at the growth in the electric generation market thats coming on thats a whole lot of market demand and a whole lot more volumes that are going to be moving across these interstate systems and it is our hope and our belief that thats going to help basis differentials improve from the levels that they are today so im hopeful that the worst is behind us but you cant guarantee what the markets going to do operator our next question is from john edwards crédit suisse john edwards  crédit suisse ag research division just real quick following up yves question what  in your recontracting about what kind of deterioration are you seeing right now stanley c horton i think we gave the guidance on  that it looked like from a base of about  million that we expected to see about a  million deterioration in revenues from the recontracting of that as we move through  that seems to be pretty much on target we have not turned our attention yet totally to  as were finishing up  we dont have the level of contract renewals that we have in  were not kind of ready to give any guidance on  hopefully we can talk about that next quarter but for  our expectations have seemed to be pretty much in line with the results that were seeing john edwards  crédit suisse ag research division yes i guess i didnt ask the question the right way i was thinking in terms of the goforward sort of percentages youre seeing i mean is it maybe  lower  lower that jamie l buskill yes john its too early  as stan said its too early to talk about  and  as we would really just get into renegotiating those here in the second half of the year so well provide more color on that but as stan mentioned right now its shaping up to be a more typical size year as far as amount of renewals we deal with although even that its a little premature to provide a number because as you deal with the contracts this year some of them may only roll a year and they do thats added to your  numbers so thats why were hesitant to give any guidance as to the number until we get toward the end of the year john edwards  crédit suisse ag research division okay fair enough and then not to belabor the loews arrangement but just  i just want to clarify so the way it works right now youre doing  on the preliminary costs and then beyond that its  the costs will fall back to boardwalk more or less jamie l buskill we didnt say how they would work beyond that all were talking to today are the preliminary construction costs and thats all we can talk to at this point and it will get to  once all the costs are incurred as i mentioned earlier we have already funded  million so today we own about  of that investment loews will be making the remaining investments this year until it gets to a  ownership and then once its at  well maintain that  relationship until the  million is spent after that well provide additional guidance as we get additional information and work through this project and have more definition to it john edwards  crédit suisse ag research division so i guess what im getting at so its possible that a portion of the project could end up at loews not  instead of boardwalk is that correct i mean beyond this preliminary stanley c horton i dont want to speculate on what might happen i think that weve got to be very careful here to specify that there is no agreement between boardwalk and loews relating to the funding of the project past the developmental stage i mean there just is not so to speculate whether there is or would not i just cant do that right now john edwards  crédit suisse ag research division okay fair enough and then just  this is kind of a followup to steves question on the  i dont know if you can speak to this but on the  at the williams boardwalk level youre indicating there are some options to increase or decrease and i wonder if you could speak to is there a maximum or minimum ownership you can speak to by the parties stanley c horton i really cant speak to that right now weve kind of  i have an agreement with williams that these are internal documents right now and all of the various scenarios they dont really mean anything until each party sits down and makes its selections and at that point in time we can give some guidance to the marketplace but i dont want to speculate what each party may do or what each partys rights may be operator our next question is from elvira scotto rbc capital markets elvira scotto  rbc capital markets llc research division i just had a question on  a followup question is there any other hurdle to get through before you can move to open season binding open season or is it just hammering out the details of the projects stanley c horton its a number of things number one doing the details of the project coming up with the absolute best estimate of project scope that we can capital costs that we can finalizing the tariff for the ngl line because its a regulated pipeline the tariff has got to be in conformance with ferc regulations finishing the various pro forma agreements that we have on the frac and storage and on the lpg terminal and then going out and talking with our customers about those rates and charges and some negotiation thats the process that were in right now the typical development process of scope timing and pro forma contracts with customers elvira scotto  rbc capital markets llc research division okay but theres no regulatorylike hurdle like the ftc issue or stanley c horton no maam no maam theres not not at this point elvira scotto  rbc capital markets llc research division okay great and then my other question are you actively  do you think theres any potential to repurpose any of your other assets stanley c horton well i mean quite frankly we have  with this project we will have now in the  years since ive been here repurposed of about  miles of our interstate pipeline we did almost  miles of the gulf south pipeline when we repurposed that from a dry gas line to a liquids gas line that formed the basis of the gathering facilities for our flag city project and we do have an abandonment application on file with the federal energy regulatory commission where about  of the pipe of gulf south would be abandoned from interstate service to intrastate service this is smalldiameter lowpressure pipeline that is really not pipeline that most people think of as intrastate pipelines so if were successful in that we would be moving a lot of those pipeline facilities into  intrastate pipelines so we continue to look for ways to operate our systems differently repurpose our pipelines and undoubtedly we will find more ways to do that operator our next question is from ross payne wells fargo stanley ross payne  wells fargo securities llc research division on the  million in preliminary cost estimates is williams varying any of the preliminary costs or is that largely the indiscernible jamie l buskill that  million is just our share of the bluegrass moss lake the total investment of that is going to be roughly  million williams will share in  and well share in  so everything weve talked to is just our share of that investment as a  owner stanley ross payne  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and can you guys give us some rough range although it could be a large range of what the ultimate costs of this project are going to look like stanley c horton no we really cant once we have finished the design of the project and gotten the customer commitments and know exactly what the size is and whether all the pieces are going to happen then we can do that but to do it before then is  serves really no purpose so stanley ross payne  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and can you  i mean that  million is a pretty large number for repurposing pipes so can you give us an idea of what a lot of those costs are going to be are there any kind of rightsofway issues that are stanley c horton no the  million is not to repurpose the pipes the  million is to do all of the predevelopment work that needs to be done on the project that includes the new build sections of segment  and segment  that i talked to you about and some of the work on the texas gas system on converting the gas line to a liquids line but it really has nothing to do with repurposing of the tgt system stanley ross payne  wells fargo securities llc research division okay and does that include getting rightsofway in that number or not stanley c horton it includes rightsofway it includes permits it includes all the preliminary stuff that you have to do for  to be ready to proceed with construction once we get the market commitments operator our next question is from matt niblack hite matt niblack yes at the sale of the base gas i see that you are including that in unadjusted ebitda and dcf is that correct jamie l buskill that is correct if you look as weve mentioned earlier this is something that we have quite often if you look at  go back since its being public most years we have some type of gas sales that we have a gain on and so its recurring enough that we do include it in our ebitda and distributable cash numbers matt niblack this is one of the larger ones though is it not jamie l buskill id have to go back in and look from a cash standpoint probably not from a gains standpoint probably its fairly large just because the basis on that was so low operator ladies and gentlemen i would now like to turn the call
