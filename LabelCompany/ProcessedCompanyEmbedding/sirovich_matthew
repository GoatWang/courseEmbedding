nyc’s homeless september     danielle beurteaux read more scopia capital matthew sirovich sirovich a managing director at scopia capital serves on the board of the bowery residents’ committee which is working to tackle homelessness in new york city        matthew sirovich and wife meredith elson the streets of new york city have never been an easy place right now approximately  men and women call them home and more than  spend the night in a shelter according to recent statistics released by the city’s department of homeless services matthew sirovich grew up in new york in the s a difficult era when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy he remembers seeing homeless people on the street and he developed a sympathy for them that only exhibited itself for the most part for  years of my life when i would give money to homeless on the street from time to time he says that changed when sirovich  managing partner at  billion hedge fund firm scopia capital management reconnected with a high school classmate at a reunion that classmate muzzy rosenblatt is the executive director of the bowery residents’ committee a nonprofit that provides services to the homeless their conversation led to a tour of brc’s facilities sirovich was impressed by the caliber of people working for brc and the outcomes they attain for their clients it was a very educational visit he says i learned a lot more about homeless people than i ever knew says sirovich i got a much better sense of why people become homeless he joined the board six years ago then joined the finance committee he was elected treasurer last year brc helps those struggling with substance abuse provides transitional housing and permanent housing and helps its clients find jobs many new yorkers have probably seen brc staff in action on the streets or in the subway — brc has a contract with the metropolitan transit authority to help men and women who are sleeping on subways and in stations but new york’s housing crisis means that there are few options for the homeless or for providing housing and there are also fewer subsidies for permanent housing in the city there are not a lot of options right now in terms of where current clients can go when they are ready to take on the responsibility of permanent housing says sirovich to attempt to answer that need brc has created a new model for financing lowincome housing the result will be a combination shelter and apartment building in the bronx to be named landing road by law new york city must provide shelter for the homeless which is usually done through the shelter system paid for by the city what the financing model for landing road does says sirovich is use the shelter part of the development to fund the apartments the rates the city pays for shelters have become attractive enough for commercial forprofit landlords explains sirovich this model would take some of those profits out of private investors’ hands and put them into a nonprofit that can then use those economics to subsidize affordable housing sirovich points to a lack of innovation when it comes to housing solutions for the homeless which he ascribes to the lack of funding from public sources to develop new ideas brc has been a leader in finding new ways to fund housing he says often turning to private donations once the concept is proven it’s more feasible to get funding from public sources sirovich says as treasurer he works with brc’s staff and oversees the organization’s finances brc’s revenues come primarily from new york city and new york state contracts although the organization is concentrating on increasing contributions from private sources that’s more of a priority because it allows us the flexibility to be creative with solutions says sirovich rosenblatt says that sirovich’s knowledge of finance has been invaluable to brc and its board but equally important are his compassion and readiness to educate others matt has become such a willing and skilled communicator of what this organization is trying to do and what our people are trying to achieve says rosenblatt he connects us to other people and that is how minds get changed changing minds is something sirovich is keen to do and he thinks there’s a growing interest in helping the homeless get their lives on track i think everyone wants to make new york a better place for everyone to live he says helping brc is a great way to help new york city related articles  most read morning brief dan loeb’s third point moves away from trump trade hedge fund  firm profiles morning brief
