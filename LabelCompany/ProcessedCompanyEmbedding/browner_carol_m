environmental regulation browner headed the florida department of environmental regulation from  to  while living in tallahassee it was the nations thirdlargest such state agency with  employees and a budget of some  million there she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other she revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the florida state government she shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlandsaffected areas and for manufacturing plants in doing so she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants

it owned in exchange for  million of work by disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby she pleased environmentalists by persuading chiles who had become governor to negotiate a settlement to a

dealing with browner she kicks the door open throws in a hand grenade and then walks in to shoot whos left she really doesnt like to compromise but she has done a pretty good job down here people have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does epa administratoredit nomination and confirmationedit after the  presidential election browner served as transition director for vice presidentelect gore presidentelect bill clinton announced her as his choice for environmental protection agency head on december   while both clinton and gore had criticized the george h w bush administrations commitment to environmental protection during the campaign the selection of browner – who was described by the washington post as having the mind and training of an attorneylegislator but the soul of an activist – was seen as an indication that gores ardent environmentalism had won out over clintons more probusiness mindset clinton later wrote that he had not known her but that chiles had recommended her highly and gore had requested she be named the pick along with several others of gore protégés that clinton made helped solidify the vice presidents position within the administration at her confirmation hearings before the united states senate committee on environment and public works browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to gore she was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the united states senate on january   she and podhorzer returned to takoma park maryland and he continued to work at citizen action her longterm goal was to leave the world a slightly better place and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home she avoided the nannygate problems of some of clintons other early female nominees by having never used a nanny she continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling skiing and jogging first four yearsedit carol browner as epa administrator at the epa browner supervised some  employees and a  billion budget early in her administration she angered some epa employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money soon after taking office browner and her top aides including assistant administrator for enforcement steven herman reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single office of enforcement and compliance assurance the epas regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures however which led to some bureaucratic conflicts browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists who objected to her support for repeal of the  delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods her announcement in may  that the epa would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists however a move by clinton to elevate the epa and browner to cabinetlevel status failed in late  to gain sufficient congressional support many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higherpriority  clinton health care plan when the republican party took control of congress after the  us elections browner took the lead for the clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the republicans especially in the house of representatives to amend the clean water act and to roll back other environmental regulations she was able to work in a bipartisan manner though with republicans in helping craft amendments to the safe drinking water act and passage of the food quality protection act during the budgetcutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in  browner successfully protected the epas review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over  million in increased spending for the agency her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right carol browner c  two initiatives begun by the clinton administration under browners tenure were part of its reinventing government program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the epas flexible publicprivate partnerships as an alternative to traditional regulation project xl in  was designed to find common sense cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities while the common sense initiative in  was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors rather than dealing with issues on a crisisbycrisis pollutantbypollutant basis project xl had mixed results with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned the more ambitious common sense initiative which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some european countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in  in march  browner and the epa were charged by the house government reform and oversight subcommittee on regulatory affairs with violating the federal antilobbying act  us code §  by faxing unsolicited material opposing the republicansponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and publicinterest groups browner denied the accusation saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections as epa administrator browner started the agencys successful brownfields program in  the program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities especially in urban areas by empowering states communities and assorted stakeholders in economic development it leveraged more than  billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use second four yearsedit perhaps browners biggest triumph came in  when she convinced clinton to support a stringent tightening of the clean air acts national ambient air quality standards regarding permissible levels of the groundlevel ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot the decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade there was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration with opposition from the presidents economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the epas scientific reviews on the matter over eighty environmental and health groups who had grown quite frustrated with the administrations preference for minimalcost incremental actions in the area pressured vice president gore to take a stand on the matter but he remained silent browners adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost singlehandedly in private meetings congressional testimony and public debate and had come in the face of a silence from the white house that had put at risk her standing within the administration some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination ultimately gore lent behindthescenes support in favor of the new regulations which was a key factor in clintons final decision in browners favor overall the new york times termed browners actions a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura and time magazine labelled browner the queen of clean air as the decision was announced one which would affect hundreds of american cities and towns browner said these new standards will provide new health protections to  million americans including  million children fema head james lee witt and administrator browner worked with a hazmat team in kinston north carolina during september  in the wake of severe flooding from hurricane floyd the change to the standards had to survive congressional review but the support of republicans from the northeast especially new york senator al damato helped compensate for democrats opposed to them the new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the us constitutions nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the us supreme court whose  unanimous ruling in the case now titled whitman v american trucking associations inc largely upheld browners and the epas actions browner and the epa also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles issuing standards in  that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by  percent over five years during her tenure browner also began efforts to deal with global warming giving the epa authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change although the epa under the following george w bush administration chose not to use that authority several other policies of hers were reversed in the bush administration as well during browners tenure there were many reports from african american employees of racism directed at them from a network of good old boys who dominated the agencys middle management the most known of these reports involved policy specialist marsha colemanadebayo who in  filed suit against the agency in  the court found the epa guilty of discrimination against colemanadebayo and awarded her  colemanadebayo said that browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up in an october  congressional hearing on the matter browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agencys senior rank during her time as administrator but was unable to explain why the culprits in colemanadebayos case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the epas treatment of colemanadebayo led to passage of the nofear act in  which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation in the final days of the clinton administration dc district judge royce c lamberth ordered the epa to preserve under the freedom of information act all documents possibly relevant to lastminute epa regulation issuances in  lamberth found the epa in contempt for not having preserved browners files but did not find browner or other officials in contempt browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not workrelated during her epa tenure browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups especially utilities and heavy manufacturing as well as with conservatives in congress who thought businesses were stifled by her policies she also battled the treasury department at times and sometimes opposed clinton himself who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations nonetheless browner was the longestserving administrator in the history of the agency staying through both terms of the clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years robert w collin author of a  text on the agency assessed her as one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the epa and wrote that she was completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues clinton himself later stated that browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements business careeredit after the clinton administration browner became a founding member of the albright group a global strategy group headed by former us secretary of state madeleine albright as a principal browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally including complying with environmental regulations and climate change cocacola and merck  co have been among the clients for such international assistance she also became a founding member and principal of albright capital management an investment

standard she was also on the founding board of the center for american progress as well as the boards of the alliance for climate protection and the league of conservation voters she left all of these boards in late  when she was named to serve in the obama administration until summer  she was a member of socialist internationals commission for a sustainable world society although the commissions web site still had her listed as a member in january  her income in  was between  million and  million from lobbying firm downey mcgrath group where her husband was a principal she also reported  in member distribution income plus retirement and other benefits from the albright group browner retained a political voice during her business career describing the george w bush administration as the worst environmental administration ever she also stated that global warming is the greatest challenge ever faced in the  presidential election she was a strong supporter of hillary clintons bid for the democratic nomination after clinton lost her bid browner campaigned for barack obama in several battleground states and in league of conservation voters events director of the white house office of energy and climate change policyedit browner spoke after presidentelect barack obama announced her appointment as an advisor on december   vice presidentelect joe biden looks on on november   browner was named to the advisory board of the obamabiden transition project on december   presidentelect barack obama named browner as assistant to the president for energy and climate change officially known as the director of the white house office of energy and climate change policy she acted as a coordinator for environmental energy climate transport and related matters for the federal government her position was sometimes informally described as the energy czar or the climate czar it did not require senate confirmation her participation on the commission for a sustainable world society drew criticism from some republican members of congress but the obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it in any case her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion i dont have any independent policymaking authority its not like when i was at epa and i could depend on regulation browners deputy assistant was heather zichal a former legislative director for senator john kerry the early months of the obama administration found her working well with the cabinet members she was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new united states emission standards in may  and also was a member of the presidential task force on the auto industry that bailed out american automakers she successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the american recovery and reinvestment act of  she was a central player in negotiation with congress of the united states carbon cap and trade program seemingly more so than us energy secretary steven chu and continued to stress its importance despite the obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the white house by september  republican members of congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies she also became a brief target of fervent anticzar radio and television commentator glenn beck following the van jones resignation browner briefed president obama and senior advisor valerie jarrett on the bp oil spill on june   in october  browner conceded that congressional passage of the capandtrade legislation before the end of year was unlikely and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the copenhagen united nations climate change conference in december by the next month she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional slicing and dicing that would separate energy and climate concerns attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in july  due to lack of enough votes in the senate browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said obviously everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation in  browner became a key part of the administration team handling and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in late may  she assessed the spill as probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country and said that the administration was prepared for the worst she added that i think what the american people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until august when the relief wells will be finished mike allen of politico later wrote that browners calm authoritative television presence during the bp oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the gulf catastrophe with republicans taking over the house of representatives following the  midterm elections chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied browners and the administrations goals were essentially nil and obama conceded as much as the obama administration neared its twoyear mark and a number of personnel changes were underway there was a possibility that browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities such as white house deputy chief of staff but that did not come to pass instead in late january  white house officials disclosed that browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future browner said of her unexpected decision theres no back story – it was just time to go and that she felt honored to have a second  chance to serve league of conservation voters president gene karpinski characterized browner as a tenacious advocate on our issues who would be sorely missed while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm bracewell  giuliani said browners exit was a good development and that her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the united states browner left the white house during march  her general responsibilities were taken over by her secondincommand heather zichal from a position within the us domestic policy council in late february  while browner was still in place the house voted to eliminate the director of the office of energy and climate change policy position altogether while the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of obamas czars browner was a particular focus of it representative steve scalise who led the effort said of browner let her leave and take the funding too in the midapril  federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown funding for the position was indeed eliminated as were three other czar roles most of which were similarly vacant obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it but the point was largely moot as the positions in question including the browner one had already been moved inside the domestic policy council return to business and advocacyedit browner rejoined the center for american progress in april  as a distinguished senior fellow and a member of the organizations executive committee she also rejoined the albright firm now known due to merger as the albright stonebridge group as a senior counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact she

power as a means to combat climate change in that role she has said that we cant take a carbonfree source of energy off the table she has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier she

environmental regulation browner headed the florida department of environmental regulation from  to  while living in tallahassee it was the nations thirdlargest such state agency with  employees and a budget of some  million there she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other she revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the florida state government she shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlandsaffected areas and for manufacturing plants in doing so she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known she brokered a deal with walt disney world that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned in exchange for  million of work by disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby she pleased environmentalists by persuading chiles who had become governor to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to everglades national park and forcing the florida sugar industry to bear much of the  billion cost the head of floridas largest business trade association described dealing with browner she kicks the door open throws in a hand grenade and then walks in to shoot whos left she really doesnt like to compromise but she has done a pretty good job down here people have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does epa administratoredit nomination and confirmationedit after the  presidential election browner served as transition director for vice presidentelect gore presidentelect bill clinton announced her as his choice for environmental protection agency head on december   while both clinton and gore had criticized the george h w bush administrations commitment to environmental protection during the campaign the selection of browner – who was described by the washington post as having the mind and training of an attorneylegislator but the soul of an activist – was seen as an indication that gores ardent environmentalism had won out over clintons more probusiness mindset clinton later wrote that he had not known her but that chiles had recommended her highly and gore had requested she be named the pick along with several others of gore protégés that clinton made helped solidify the vice presidents position within the administration at her confirmation hearings before the united states senate committee on environment and public works browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to gore she was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the united states senate on january   she and podhorzer returned to takoma park maryland and he continued to work at citizen action her longterm goal was to leave the world a slightly better place and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home she avoided the nannygate problems of some of clintons other early female nominees by having never used a nanny she continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling skiing and jogging first four yearsedit carol browner as epa administrator at the epa browner supervised some  employees and a  billion budget early in her administration she angered some epa employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money soon after taking office browner and her top aides including assistant administrator for enforcement steven herman reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single office of enforcement and compliance assurance the epas regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures however which led to some bureaucratic conflicts browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists who objected to her support for repeal of the  delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods her announcement in may  that the epa would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists however a move by clinton to elevate the epa and browner to cabinetlevel status failed in late  to gain sufficient congressional support many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higherpriority  clinton health care plan when the republican party took control of congress after the  us elections browner took the lead for the clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the republicans especially in the house of representatives to amend the clean water act and to roll back other environmental regulations she was able to work in a bipartisan manner though with republicans in helping craft amendments to the safe drinking water act and passage of the food quality protection act during the budgetcutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in  browner successfully protected the epas review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over  million in increased spending for the agency her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right carol browner c  two initiatives begun by the clinton administration under browners tenure were part of its reinventing government program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the epas flexible publicprivate partnerships as an alternative to traditional regulation project xl in  was designed to find common sense cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities while the common sense initiative in  was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors rather than dealing with issues on a crisisbycrisis pollutantbypollutant basis project xl had mixed results with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned the more ambitious common sense initiative which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some european countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in  in march  browner and the epa were charged by the house government reform and oversight subcommittee on regulatory affairs with violating the federal antilobbying act  us code §  by faxing unsolicited material opposing the republicansponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and publicinterest groups browner denied the accusation saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections as epa administrator browner started the agencys successful brownfields program in  the program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities especially in urban areas by empowering states communities and assorted stakeholders in economic development it leveraged more than  billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use second four yearsedit perhaps browners biggest triumph came in  when she convinced clinton to support a stringent tightening of the clean air acts national ambient air quality standards regarding permissible levels of the groundlevel ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot the decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade there was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration with opposition from the presidents economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the epas scientific reviews on the matter over eighty environmental and health groups who had grown quite frustrated with the administrations preference for minimalcost incremental actions in the area pressured vice president gore to take a stand on the matter but he remained silent browners adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost singlehandedly in private meetings congressional testimony and public debate and had come in the face of a silence from the white house that had put at risk her standing within the administration some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination ultimately gore lent behindthescenes support in favor of the new regulations which was a key factor in clintons final decision in browners favor overall the new york times termed browners actions a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura and time magazine labelled browner the queen of clean air as the decision was announced one which would affect hundreds of american cities and towns browner said these new standards will provide new health protections to  million americans including  million children fema head james lee witt and administrator browner worked with a hazmat team in kinston north carolina during september  in the wake of severe flooding from hurricane floyd the change to the standards had to survive congressional review but the support of republicans from the northeast especially new york senator al damato helped compensate for democrats opposed to them the new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the us constitutions nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the us supreme court whose  unanimous ruling in the case now titled whitman v american trucking associations inc largely upheld browners and the epas actions browner and the epa also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles issuing standards in  that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by  percent over five years during her tenure browner also began efforts to deal with global warming giving the epa authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change although the epa under the following george w bush administration chose not to use that authority several other policies of hers were reversed in the bush administration as well during browners tenure there were many reports from african american employees of racism directed at them from a network of good old boys who dominated the agencys middle management the most known of these reports involved policy specialist marsha colemanadebayo who in  filed suit against the agency in  the court found the epa guilty of discrimination against colemanadebayo and awarded her  colemanadebayo said that browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up in an october  congressional hearing on the matter browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agencys senior rank during her time as administrator but was unable to explain why the culprits in colemanadebayos case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the epas treatment of colemanadebayo led to passage of the nofear act in  which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation in the final days of the clinton administration dc district judge royce c lamberth ordered the epa to preserve under the freedom of information act all documents possibly relevant to lastminute epa regulation issuances in  lamberth found the epa in contempt for not having preserved browners files but did not find browner or other officials in contempt browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not workrelated during her epa tenure browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups especially utilities and heavy manufacturing as well as with conservatives in congress who thought businesses were stifled by her policies she also battled the treasury department at times and sometimes opposed clinton himself who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations nonetheless browner was the longestserving administrator in the history of the agency staying through both terms of the clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years robert w collin author of a  text on the agency assessed her as one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the epa and wrote that she was completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues clinton himself later stated that browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements business careeredit after the clinton administration browner became a founding member of the albright group a global strategy group headed by former us secretary of state madeleine albright as a principal browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally including complying with environmental regulations and climate change cocacola and merck  co have been among the clients for such international assistance she also became a founding member and principal of albright capital management an investment advisory company during  she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater now named the fredric g levin college of law browner is now married to former congressman thomas downey the

ports world but were unable to persuade senator charles schumer to their viewpoint during the dubai ports world controversy browner testifying before the us senate committee on environment and public works in april  browner joined the board of the national audubon society in  and became chair in  her term expired in  she also joined the board of the alliance for climate protection an organization founded by gore in  in  she joined the board of apx inc which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets including those for carbon offsets and the cdm gold standard she was also on the founding board of the center for american progress as well as the boards of the alliance for climate protection and the league of conservation voters she left all of these boards in late  when she was named to serve in the obama administration until summer  she was a member of socialist internationals commission for a sustainable world society although the commissions web site still had her listed as a member in january  her income in  was between  million and  million from lobbying firm downey mcgrath group where her husband was a principal she also reported  in member distribution income plus retirement and other benefits from the albright group browner retained a political voice during her business career describing the george w bush administration as the worst environmental administration ever she also stated that global warming is the greatest challenge ever faced in the  presidential election she was a strong supporter of hillary clintons bid for the democratic nomination after clinton lost her bid browner campaigned for barack obama in several battleground states and in league of conservation voters events director of the white house office of energy and climate change policyedit browner spoke after presidentelect barack obama announced her appointment as an advisor on december   vice presidentelect joe biden looks on on november   browner was named to the advisory board of the obamabiden transition project on december   presidentelect barack obama named browner as assistant to the president for energy and climate change officially known as the director of the white house office of energy and climate change policy she acted as a coordinator for environmental energy climate transport and related matters for the federal government her position was sometimes informally described as the energy czar or the climate czar it did not require senate confirmation her participation on the commission for a sustainable world society drew criticism from some republican members of congress but the obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it in any case her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion i dont have any independent policymaking authority its not like when i was at epa and i could depend on regulation browners deputy assistant was heather zichal a former legislative director for senator john kerry the early months of the obama administration found her working well with the cabinet members she was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new united states emission standards in may  and also was a member of the presidential task force on the auto industry that bailed out american automakers she successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the american recovery and reinvestment act of  she was a central player in negotiation with congress of the united states carbon cap and trade program seemingly more so than us energy secretary steven chu and continued to stress its importance despite the obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the white house by september  republican members of congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies she also became a brief target of fervent anticzar radio and television commentator glenn beck following the van jones resignation browner briefed president obama and senior advisor valerie jarrett on the bp oil spill on june   in october  browner conceded that congressional passage of the capandtrade legislation before the end of year was unlikely and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the copenhagen united nations climate change conference in december by the next month she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional slicing and dicing that would separate energy and climate concerns attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in july  due to lack of enough votes in the senate browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said obviously everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation in  browner became a key part of the administration team handling and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in late may  she assessed the spill as probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country and said that the administration was prepared for the worst she added that i think what the american people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until august when the relief wells will be finished mike allen of politico later wrote that browners calm authoritative television presence during the bp oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the gulf catastrophe with republicans taking over the house of representatives following the  midterm elections chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied browners and the administrations goals were essentially nil and obama conceded as much as the obama administration neared its twoyear mark and a number of personnel changes were underway there was a possibility that browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities such as white house deputy chief of staff but that did not come to pass instead in late january  white house officials disclosed that browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future browner said of her unexpected decision theres no back story – it was just time to go and that she felt honored to have a second  chance to serve league of conservation voters president gene karpinski characterized browner as a tenacious advocate on our issues who would be sorely missed while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm bracewell  giuliani said browners exit was a good development and that her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the united states browner left the white house during march  her general responsibilities were taken over by her secondincommand heather zichal from a position within the us domestic policy council in late february  while browner was still in place the house voted to eliminate the director of the office of energy and climate change policy position altogether while the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of obamas czars browner was a particular focus of it representative steve scalise who led the effort said of browner let her leave and take the funding too in the midapril  federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown funding for the position was indeed eliminated as were three other czar roles most of which were similarly vacant obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it but the point was largely moot as the positions in question including the browner one had already been moved inside the domestic policy council return to business and advocacyedit browner rejoined the center for american progress in april  as a distinguished senior fellow and a member of the organizations executive committee she also rejoined the albright firm now known due to merger as the albright stonebridge group as a senior counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact she continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was disappointed by the obama administrations september  decision to drop toughening of lowaltitude ozone levels in the national ambient air quality standards in july  browner was named to the board of directors of bunge limited a global agribusiness and food company in november  she was named to the advisory board of opower a

power as a means to combat climate change in that role she has said that we cant take a carbonfree source of energy off the table she has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier she would probably not be pronuclear but said that i think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced and it would simply be irresponsible not to consider nuclear energy as part of the

budget of some  million there she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other she revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the florida state government she shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlandsaffected areas and for manufacturing plants in doing so she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known she brokered a deal with walt disney world that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned in exchange for  million of work by disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby she pleased environmentalists by persuading chiles who had become governor to negotiate a settlement to a

dealing with browner she kicks the door open throws in a hand grenade and then walks in to shoot whos left she really doesnt like to compromise but she has done a pretty good job down here people have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does epa administratoredit nomination and confirmationedit after the  presidential election browner served as transition director for vice presidentelect gore presidentelect bill clinton announced her as his choice for environmental protection agency head on december   while both clinton and gore had criticized the george h w bush administrations commitment to environmental protection during the campaign the selection of browner – who was described by the washington post as having the mind and training of an attorneylegislator but the soul of an activist – was seen as an indication that gores ardent environmentalism had won out over clintons more probusiness mindset clinton later wrote that he had not known her but that chiles had recommended her highly and gore had requested she be named the pick along with several others of gore protégés that clinton made helped solidify the vice presidents position within the administration at her confirmation hearings before the united states senate committee on environment and public works browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to gore she was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the united states senate on january   she and podhorzer returned to takoma park maryland and he continued to work at citizen action her longterm goal was to leave the world a slightly better place and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home she avoided the nannygate problems of some of clintons other early female nominees by having never used a nanny she continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling skiing and jogging first four yearsedit carol browner as epa administrator at the epa browner supervised some  employees and a  billion budget early in her administration she angered some epa employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money soon after taking office browner and her top aides including assistant administrator for enforcement steven herman reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single office of enforcement and compliance assurance the epas regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures however which led to some bureaucratic conflicts browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists who objected to her support for repeal of the  delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods her announcement in may  that the epa would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists however a move by clinton to elevate the epa and browner to cabinetlevel status failed in late  to gain sufficient congressional support many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higherpriority  clinton health care plan when the republican party took control of congress after the  us elections browner took the lead for the clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the republicans especially in the house of representatives to amend the clean water act and to roll back other environmental regulations she was able to work in a bipartisan manner though with republicans in helping craft amendments to the safe drinking water act and passage of the food quality protection act during the budgetcutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in  browner successfully protected the epas review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over  million in increased spending for the agency her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right carol browner c  two initiatives begun by the clinton administration under browners tenure were part of its reinventing government program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the epas flexible publicprivate partnerships as an alternative to traditional regulation project xl in  was designed to find common sense cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities while the common sense initiative in  was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors rather than dealing with issues on a crisisbycrisis pollutantbypollutant basis project xl had mixed results with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned the more ambitious common sense initiative which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some european countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in  in march  browner and the epa were charged by the house government reform and oversight subcommittee on regulatory affairs with violating the federal antilobbying act  us code §  by faxing unsolicited material opposing the republicansponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and publicinterest groups browner denied the accusation saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections as epa administrator browner started the agencys successful brownfields program in  the program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities especially in urban areas by empowering states communities and assorted stakeholders in economic development it leveraged more than  billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use second four yearsedit perhaps browners biggest triumph came in  when she convinced clinton to support a stringent tightening of the clean air acts national ambient air quality standards regarding permissible levels of the groundlevel ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot the decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade there was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration with opposition from the presidents economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the epas scientific reviews on the matter over eighty environmental and health groups who had grown quite frustrated with the administrations preference for minimalcost incremental actions in the area pressured vice president gore to take a stand on the matter but he remained silent browners adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost singlehandedly in private meetings congressional testimony and public debate and had come in the face of a silence from the white house that had put at risk her standing within the administration some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination ultimately gore lent behindthescenes support in favor of the new regulations which was a key factor in clintons final decision in browners favor overall the new york times termed browners actions a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura and time magazine labelled browner the queen of clean air as the decision was announced one which would affect hundreds of american cities and towns browner said these new standards will provide new health protections to  million americans including  million children fema head james lee witt and administrator browner worked with a hazmat team in kinston north carolina during september  in the wake of severe flooding from hurricane floyd the change to the standards had to survive congressional review but the support of republicans from the northeast especially new york senator al damato helped compensate for democrats opposed to them the new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the us constitutions nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the us supreme court whose  unanimous ruling in the case now titled whitman v american trucking associations inc largely upheld browners and the epas actions browner and the epa also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles issuing standards in  that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by  percent over five years during her tenure browner also began efforts to deal with global warming giving the epa authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change although the epa under the following george w bush administration chose not to use that authority several other policies of hers were reversed in the bush administration as well during browners tenure there were many reports from african american employees of racism directed at them from a network of good old boys who dominated the agencys middle management the most known of these reports involved policy specialist marsha colemanadebayo who in  filed suit against the agency in  the court found the epa guilty of discrimination against colemanadebayo and awarded her  colemanadebayo said that browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up in an october  congressional hearing on the matter browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agencys senior rank during her time as administrator but was unable to explain why the culprits in colemanadebayos case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the epas treatment of colemanadebayo led to passage of the nofear act in  which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation in the final days of the clinton administration dc district judge royce c lamberth ordered the epa to preserve under the freedom of information act all documents possibly relevant to lastminute epa regulation issuances in  lamberth found the epa in contempt for not having preserved browners files but did not find browner or other officials in contempt browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not workrelated during her epa tenure browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups especially utilities and heavy manufacturing as well as with conservatives in congress who thought businesses were stifled by her policies she also battled the treasury department at times and sometimes opposed clinton himself who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations nonetheless browner was the longestserving administrator in the history of the agency staying through both terms of the clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years robert w collin author of a  text on the agency assessed her as one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the epa and wrote that she was completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues clinton himself later stated that browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements business careeredit after the clinton administration browner became a founding member of the albright group a global strategy group headed by former us secretary of

web site still had her listed as a member in january  her income in  was between  million and  million from lobbying firm downey mcgrath group where her husband was a principal she also reported  in

worst environmental administration ever she also stated that global warming is the greatest challenge ever faced in the  presidential election she was a strong supporter of hillary clintons bid for

seemingly more so than us energy secretary steven chu and continued to stress its importance despite the obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the white house by september  republican members of congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies she also became a brief target of fervent anticzar radio and television commentator glenn beck following the van jones resignation browner briefed president obama and senior advisor valerie jarrett on the bp oil spill on june   in october  browner conceded that congressional passage of the capandtrade legislation before the end of year was unlikely and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the copenhagen united nations climate change conference in december by the next month she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional slicing and dicing that would separate energy and climate concerns attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in july  due to lack of enough votes in the senate browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said obviously everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation in  browner became a key part of the administration team handling and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in late may  she assessed the spill as probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country and said that the administration was prepared for the worst she added that i think what the american people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until august when the relief wells will be finished mike allen of politico later wrote that browners calm authoritative television presence during the bp oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the gulf catastrophe with republicans taking over the house of representatives following the  midterm elections chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied browners and the administrations goals were essentially nil and obama conceded as much as the obama administration neared its twoyear mark and a number of personnel changes were underway there was a possibility that browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities such as white house deputy chief of staff but that did not come to pass instead in late january  white house officials disclosed that browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future browner said of her unexpected decision theres no back story – it was just time to go and that she felt honored to have a second  chance to serve league of conservation voters president gene karpinski characterized browner as a tenacious advocate on our issues who would be sorely missed while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm bracewell  giuliani said browners exit was a good development and that her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the united states browner left the white house during march  her general responsibilities were taken over by her secondincommand heather zichal from a position within the us domestic policy council in late february  while browner was still in place the house voted to eliminate the director of the office of energy and climate change policy position altogether while the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of obamas czars browner was a particular focus of it representative steve scalise who led the effort said of browner let her leave and take the funding too in the midapril  federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown funding for the position was indeed eliminated as were three other czar roles most of which were similarly vacant obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it but the point was largely moot as the positions in question including the browner one had already been moved inside the domestic policy council return to business and advocacyedit browner rejoined the center for american progress in april  as a distinguished senior fellow and a member of the organizations executive committee she also rejoined the albright firm now known due to merger as the albright stonebridge group as a senior counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact she continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was disappointed by the obama administrations september  decision to drop toughening of lowaltitude ozone levels in the national ambient air quality standards in july  browner was named to the board of directors of bunge limited a global agribusiness and food company in november  she was named to the advisory board of opower a

was elected as chair of the board of directors of the league of conservation voters in april  she joined the leadership council of nuclear matters an industrybacked group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change in that role she has said that we cant take a carbonfree source of energy off the table she has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier she would probably not be pronuclear but said that i think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced and it would simply be irresponsible not to consider nuclear energy as part of the

it into one of the most active in the florida state government she shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlandsaffected areas and for manufacturing plants in doing so she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants

it owned in exchange for  million of work by disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby she pleased environmentalists by persuading chiles who had become governor to negotiate a settlement to a

presidentelect gore presidentelect bill clinton announced her as his choice for environmental protection agency head on december   while both clinton and gore had criticized the george h w bush administrations commitment to environmental protection during the campaign the selection of browner – who was described by the washington post as having the mind and training of an attorneylegislator but the soul of an activist – was seen as an indication that gores ardent environmentalism had won out over clintons more probusiness mindset clinton later wrote that he had not known her but that chiles had recommended her highly and gore had requested she be named the pick along with several others of gore protégés that clinton made helped solidify the vice presidents position within the administration at her confirmation hearings before the united states senate committee on environment and public works browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to gore she was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the united states senate on january   she and podhorzer returned to takoma park maryland and he continued to work at citizen action her longterm goal was to leave the world a slightly better place and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home she avoided the nannygate problems of some of clintons other early female nominees by having never used a nanny she continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling skiing and jogging first four yearsedit carol browner as epa administrator at the epa browner supervised some  employees and a  billion budget early in her administration she angered some epa employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money soon after taking office browner and her top aides including assistant administrator for enforcement steven herman reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single office of enforcement and compliance assurance the epas regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures however which led to some bureaucratic conflicts browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists who objected to her support for repeal of the  delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods her announcement in may  that the epa would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists however a move by clinton to elevate the epa and browner to cabinetlevel status failed in late  to gain sufficient congressional support many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higherpriority  clinton health care plan when the republican party took control of congress after the  us elections browner took the lead for the clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the republicans especially in the house of representatives to amend the clean water act and to roll back other environmental regulations she was able to work in a bipartisan manner though with republicans in helping craft amendments to the safe drinking water act and passage of the food quality protection act during the budgetcutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in  browner successfully protected the epas review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over  million in increased spending for the agency her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right carol browner c  two initiatives begun by the clinton administration under browners tenure were part of its reinventing government program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the epas flexible publicprivate partnerships as an alternative to traditional regulation project xl in  was designed to find common sense cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities while the common sense initiative in  was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors rather than dealing with issues on a crisisbycrisis pollutantbypollutant basis project xl had mixed results with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned the more ambitious common sense initiative which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some european countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in  in march  browner and the epa were charged by the house government reform and oversight subcommittee on regulatory affairs with violating the federal antilobbying act  us code §  by faxing unsolicited material opposing the republicansponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and publicinterest groups browner denied the accusation saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections as epa administrator browner started the agencys successful brownfields program in  the program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities especially in urban areas by empowering states communities and assorted stakeholders in economic development it leveraged more than  billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use second four yearsedit perhaps browners biggest triumph came in  when she convinced clinton to support a stringent tightening of the clean air acts national ambient air quality standards regarding permissible levels of the groundlevel ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot the decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade there was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration with opposition from the presidents economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the epas scientific reviews on the matter over eighty environmental and health groups who had grown quite frustrated with the administrations preference for minimalcost incremental actions in the area pressured vice president gore to take a stand on the matter but he remained silent browners adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost singlehandedly in private meetings congressional testimony and public debate and had come in the face of a silence from the white house that had put at risk her standing within the administration some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination ultimately gore lent behindthescenes support in favor of the new regulations which was a key factor in clintons final decision in browners favor overall the new york times termed browners actions a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura and time magazine labelled browner the queen of clean air as the decision was announced one which would affect hundreds of american cities and towns browner said these new standards will provide new health protections to  million americans including  million children fema head james lee witt and administrator browner worked with a hazmat team in kinston north carolina during september  in the wake of severe flooding from hurricane floyd the change to the standards had to survive congressional review but the support of republicans from the northeast especially new york senator al damato helped compensate for democrats opposed to them the new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the us constitutions nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the us supreme court whose  unanimous ruling in the case now titled whitman v american trucking associations inc largely upheld browners and the epas actions browner and the epa also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles issuing standards in  that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by  percent over five years during her tenure browner also began efforts to deal with global warming giving the epa authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change although the epa under the following george w bush administration chose not to use that authority several other policies of hers were reversed in the bush administration as well during browners tenure there were many reports from african american employees of racism directed at them from a network of good old boys who dominated the agencys middle management the most known of these reports involved policy specialist marsha colemanadebayo who in  filed suit against the agency in  the court found the epa guilty of discrimination against colemanadebayo and awarded her  colemanadebayo said that browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up in an october  congressional hearing on the matter browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agencys senior rank during her time as administrator but was unable to explain why the culprits in colemanadebayos case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the epas treatment of colemanadebayo led to passage of the nofear act in  which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation in the final days of the clinton administration dc district judge royce c lamberth ordered the epa to preserve under the freedom of information act all documents possibly relevant to lastminute epa regulation issuances in  lamberth found the epa in contempt for not having preserved browners files but did not find browner or other officials in contempt browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not workrelated during her epa tenure browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups especially utilities and heavy manufacturing as well as with conservatives in congress who thought businesses were stifled by her policies she also battled the treasury department at times and sometimes opposed clinton himself who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations nonetheless browner was the longestserving administrator in the history of the agency staying through both terms of the clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years robert w collin author of a  text on the agency assessed her as one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the epa and wrote that she was completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues clinton himself later stated that browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements business careeredit after the clinton administration browner became a founding member of the albright group a global strategy group headed by former us secretary of state madeleine albright as a principal browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally including complying with environmental regulations and climate change cocacola and merck  co have been among the clients for such international assistance she also became a founding member and principal of albright capital management an investment

ports world but were unable to persuade senator charles schumer to their viewpoint during the dubai ports world controversy browner testifying before the us senate committee on environment and public works in april  browner joined the board of the national audubon society in  and became chair in  her term expired in  she also joined the board of the alliance for climate protection an organization founded by gore in  in  she joined the board of apx inc which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets including those for carbon offsets and the cdm gold standard she was also on the founding board of the center for american progress as well as the boards of the alliance for climate protection and the league of conservation voters she left all of these boards in late  when she was named to serve in the obama administration until summer  she was a member of socialist internationals commission for a sustainable world society although the commissions web site still had her listed as a member in january  her income in  was between  million and  million from lobbying firm downey mcgrath group where her husband was a principal she also reported  in member distribution income plus retirement and other benefits from the albright group browner retained a political voice during her business career describing the george w bush administration as the worst environmental administration ever she also stated that global warming is the greatest challenge ever faced in the  presidential election she was a strong supporter of hillary clintons bid for the democratic nomination after clinton lost her bid browner campaigned for barack obama in several battleground states and in league of conservation voters events director of the white house office of energy and climate change policyedit browner spoke after presidentelect barack obama announced her appointment as an advisor on december   vice presidentelect joe biden looks on on november   browner was named to the advisory board of the obamabiden transition project on december   presidentelect barack obama named browner as assistant to the president for energy and climate change officially known as the director of the white house office of energy and climate change policy she acted as a coordinator for environmental energy climate transport and related matters for the federal government her position was sometimes informally described as the energy czar or the climate czar it did not require senate confirmation her participation on the commission for a sustainable world society drew criticism from some republican members of congress but the obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it in any case her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion i dont have any independent policymaking authority its not like when i was at epa and i could depend on regulation browners deputy assistant was heather zichal a former legislative director for senator john kerry the early months of the obama administration found her working well with the cabinet members she was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new united states emission standards in may  and also was a member of the presidential task force on the auto industry that bailed out american automakers she successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the american recovery and reinvestment act of  she was a central player in negotiation with congress of the united states carbon cap and trade program seemingly more so than us energy secretary steven chu and continued to stress its importance despite the obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the white house by september  republican members of congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies she also became a brief target of fervent anticzar radio and television commentator glenn beck following the van jones resignation browner briefed president obama and senior advisor valerie jarrett on the bp oil spill on june   in october  browner conceded that congressional passage of the capandtrade legislation before the end of year was unlikely and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the copenhagen united nations climate change conference in december by the next month she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional slicing and dicing that would separate energy and climate concerns attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in july  due to lack of enough votes in the senate browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said obviously everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation in  browner became a key part of the administration team handling and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in late may  she assessed the spill as probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country and said that the administration was prepared for the worst she added that i think what the american people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until august when the relief wells will be finished mike allen of politico later wrote that browners calm authoritative television presence during the bp oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the gulf catastrophe with republicans taking over the house of representatives following the  midterm elections chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied browners and the administrations goals were essentially nil and obama conceded as much as the obama administration neared its twoyear mark and a number of personnel changes were underway there was a possibility that browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities such as white house deputy chief of staff but that did not come to pass instead in late january  white house officials disclosed that browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future browner said of her unexpected decision theres no back story – it was just time to go and that she felt honored to have a second  chance to serve league of conservation voters president gene karpinski characterized browner as a tenacious advocate on our issues who would be sorely missed while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm bracewell  giuliani said browners exit was a good development and that her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the united states browner left the white house during march  her general responsibilities were taken over by her secondincommand heather zichal from a position within the us domestic policy council in late february  while browner was still in place the house voted to eliminate the director of the office of energy and climate change policy position altogether while the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of obamas czars browner was a particular focus of it representative steve scalise who led the effort said of browner let her leave and take the funding too in the midapril  federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown funding for the position was indeed eliminated as were three other czar roles most of which were similarly vacant obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it but the point was largely moot as the positions in question including the browner one had already been moved inside the domestic policy council return to business and advocacyedit browner rejoined the center for american progress in april  as a distinguished senior fellow and a member of the organizations executive committee she also rejoined the albright firm now known due to merger as the albright stonebridge group as a senior counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact she continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was disappointed by the obama administrations september  decision to drop toughening of lowaltitude ozone levels in the national ambient air quality standards in july  browner was named to the board of directors of bunge limited a global agribusiness and food company in november  she was named to the advisory board of opower a software provider to the utility industry in january  she joined the global ocean commission an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity which issued its final report in  in march  she was elected as chair of the board of directors of the league of conservation voters in april  she joined the leadership council of nuclear matters an industrybacked group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change in that role she has said that we cant take a carbonfree source of energy off the table she has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier she would probably not be pronuclear but said that i think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced and it would simply be irresponsible not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution awards and honorsedit in april  browner received the outstanding mother of the year award from the national mothers day committee for her dedication to providing children with a safer

and became known as a gore protégé she helped prepare amendments to the clean air act and managed gores legislative staff secretary of environmental regulation for floridaedit as secretary of environmental regulation browner headed the florida department of environmental regulation from  to  while living in tallahassee it was the nations thirdlargest such state agency with  employees and a budget of some  million there she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other she revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the florida state government she shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlandsaffected areas and for manufacturing plants in doing so she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known she brokered a deal with walt disney world that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned in exchange for  million of work by disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby she pleased environmentalists by persuading chiles who had become governor to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to everglades national park and forcing the florida sugar industry to bear much of the  billion cost the head of floridas largest business trade association described dealing with browner she kicks the door open throws in a hand grenade and then walks in to shoot whos left she really doesnt like to compromise but she has done a pretty good job down here people have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does epa administratoredit nomination and confirmationedit after the  presidential election browner served as transition director for vice presidentelect gore presidentelect bill clinton announced her as his choice for environmental protection agency head on december   while both clinton and gore had criticized the george h w bush administrations commitment to environmental protection during the campaign the selection of browner – who was described by the washington post as having the mind and training of an attorneylegislator but the soul of an activist – was seen as an indication that gores ardent environmentalism had won out over clintons more probusiness mindset clinton later wrote that he had not known her but that chiles had recommended her highly and gore had requested she be named the pick along with several others of gore protégés that clinton made helped solidify the vice presidents position within the administration at her confirmation hearings before the united states senate committee on environment and public works browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to gore she was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the united states senate on january   she and podhorzer returned to takoma park maryland and he continued to work at citizen action her longterm goal was to leave the world a slightly better place and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home she avoided the nannygate problems of some of clintons other early female nominees by having never used a nanny she continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling skiing and jogging first four yearsedit carol browner as epa administrator at the epa browner supervised some  employees and a  billion budget early in her administration she angered some epa employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money soon after taking office browner and her top aides including assistant administrator for enforcement steven herman reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single office of enforcement and compliance assurance the epas regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures however which led to some bureaucratic conflicts browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists who objected to her support for repeal of the  delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods her announcement in may  that the epa would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists however a move by clinton to elevate the epa and browner to cabinetlevel status failed in late  to gain sufficient congressional support many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higherpriority  clinton health care plan when the republican party took control of congress after the  us elections browner took the lead for the clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the republicans especially in the house of representatives to amend the clean water act and to roll back other environmental regulations she was able to work in a bipartisan manner though with republicans in helping craft amendments to the safe drinking water act and passage of the food quality protection act during the budgetcutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in  browner successfully protected the epas review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over  million in increased spending for the agency her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right carol browner c  two initiatives begun by the clinton administration under browners tenure were part of its reinventing government program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the epas flexible publicprivate partnerships as an alternative to traditional regulation project xl in  was designed to find common sense cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities while the common sense initiative in  was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors rather than dealing with issues on a crisisbycrisis pollutantbypollutant basis project xl had mixed results with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned the more ambitious common sense initiative which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some european countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in  in march  browner and the epa were charged by the house government reform and oversight subcommittee on regulatory affairs with violating the federal antilobbying act  us code §  by faxing unsolicited material opposing the republicansponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and publicinterest groups browner denied the accusation saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections as epa administrator browner started the agencys successful brownfields program in  the program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities especially in urban areas by empowering states communities and assorted stakeholders in economic development it leveraged more than  billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use second four yearsedit perhaps browners biggest triumph came in  when she convinced clinton to support a stringent tightening of the clean air acts national ambient air quality standards regarding permissible levels of the groundlevel ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot the decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade there was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration with opposition from the presidents economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the epas scientific reviews on the matter over eighty environmental and health groups who had grown quite frustrated with the administrations preference for minimalcost incremental actions in the area pressured vice president gore to take a stand on the matter but he remained silent browners adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost singlehandedly in private meetings congressional testimony and public debate and had come in the face of a silence from the white house that had put at risk her standing within the administration some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination ultimately gore lent behindthescenes support in favor of the new regulations which was a key factor in clintons final decision in browners favor overall the new york times termed browners actions a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura and time magazine labelled browner the queen of clean air as the decision was announced one which would affect hundreds of american cities and towns browner said these new standards will provide new health protections to  million americans including  million children fema head james lee witt and administrator browner worked with a hazmat team in kinston north carolina during september  in the wake of severe flooding from hurricane floyd the change to the standards had to survive congressional review but the support of republicans from the northeast especially new york senator al damato helped compensate for democrats opposed to them the new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the us constitutions nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the us supreme court whose  unanimous ruling in the case now titled whitman v american trucking associations inc largely upheld browners and the epas actions browner and the epa also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles issuing standards in  that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by  percent over five years during her tenure browner also began efforts to deal with global warming giving the epa authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change although the epa under the following george w bush administration chose not to use that authority several other policies of hers were reversed in the bush administration as well during browners tenure there were many reports from african american employees of racism directed at them from a network of good old boys who dominated the agencys middle management the most known of these reports involved policy specialist marsha colemanadebayo who in  filed suit against the agency in  the court found the epa guilty of discrimination against colemanadebayo and awarded her  colemanadebayo said that browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up in an october  congressional hearing on the matter browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agencys senior rank during her time as administrator but was unable to explain why the culprits in colemanadebayos case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the epas treatment of colemanadebayo led to passage of the nofear act in  which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation in the final days of the clinton administration dc district judge royce c lamberth ordered the epa to preserve under the freedom of information act all documents possibly relevant to lastminute epa regulation issuances in  lamberth found the epa in contempt for not having preserved browners files but did not find browner or other officials in contempt browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not workrelated during her epa tenure browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups especially utilities and heavy manufacturing as well as with conservatives in congress who thought businesses were stifled by her policies she also battled the treasury department at times and sometimes opposed clinton himself who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations nonetheless browner was the longestserving administrator in the history of the agency staying through both terms of the clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years robert w collin author of a  text on the agency assessed her as one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the epa and wrote that she was completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues clinton himself later stated that browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements business careeredit after the clinton administration browner became a founding member of the albright group a global strategy group headed by former us secretary of state madeleine albright as a principal browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally including complying with environmental regulations and climate change cocacola and merck  co have been among the clients for such international assistance she also became a founding member and principal of albright capital management an investment

founded by gore in  in  she joined the board of apx inc which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets including those for carbon offsets and the cdm gold standard she was also on the founding board of the center for american progress as well as the boards of the alliance for climate protection and the league of conservation voters she left all of these boards in late  when she was named to serve in the obama administration until summer  she was a member of socialist internationals commission for a sustainable world society although the commissions web site still had her listed as a member in january  her income in  was between  million and  million from lobbying firm downey mcgrath group where her husband was a principal she also reported  in member distribution income plus retirement and other benefits from the albright group browner retained a political voice during her business career describing the george w bush administration as the worst environmental administration ever she also stated that global warming is the greatest challenge ever faced in the  presidential election she was a strong supporter of hillary clintons bid for the democratic nomination after clinton lost her bid browner campaigned for barack obama in several battleground states and in league of conservation voters events director of the white house office of energy and climate change policyedit browner spoke after presidentelect barack obama announced her appointment as an advisor on december   vice presidentelect joe biden looks on on november   browner was named to the advisory board of the obamabiden transition project on december   presidentelect barack obama named browner as assistant to the president for energy and climate change officially known as the director of the white house office of energy and climate change policy she acted as a coordinator for environmental energy climate transport and related matters for the federal government her position was sometimes informally described as the energy czar or the climate czar it did not require senate confirmation her participation on the commission for a sustainable world society drew criticism from some republican members of congress but the obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it in any case her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion i dont have any independent policymaking authority its not like when i was at epa and i could depend on regulation browners deputy assistant was heather zichal a former legislative director for senator john kerry the early months of the obama administration found her working well with the cabinet members she was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new united states emission standards in may  and also was a member of the presidential task force on the auto industry that bailed out american automakers she successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the american recovery and reinvestment act of  she was a central player in negotiation with congress of the united states carbon cap and trade program seemingly more so than us energy secretary steven chu and continued to stress its importance despite the obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the white house by september  republican members of congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies she also became a brief target of fervent anticzar radio and television commentator glenn beck following the van jones resignation browner briefed president obama and senior advisor valerie jarrett on the bp oil spill on june   in october  browner conceded that congressional passage of the capandtrade legislation before the end of year was unlikely and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the copenhagen united nations climate change conference in december by the next month she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional slicing and dicing that would separate energy and climate concerns attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in july  due to lack of enough votes in the senate browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said obviously everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation in  browner became a key part of the administration team handling and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about the bp deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in late may  she assessed the spill as probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country and said that the administration was prepared for the worst she added that i think what the american people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until august when the relief wells will be finished mike allen of politico later wrote that browners calm authoritative television presence during the bp oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the gulf catastrophe with republicans taking over the house of representatives following the  midterm elections chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied browners and the administrations goals were essentially nil and obama conceded as much as the obama administration neared its twoyear mark and a number of personnel changes were underway there was a possibility that browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities such as white house deputy chief of staff but that did not come to pass instead in late january  white house officials disclosed that browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future browner said of her unexpected decision theres no back story – it was just time to go and that she felt honored to have a second  chance to serve league of conservation voters president gene karpinski characterized browner as a tenacious advocate on our issues who would be sorely missed while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm bracewell  giuliani said browners exit was a good development and that her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the united states browner left the white house during march  her general responsibilities were taken over by her secondincommand heather zichal from a position within the us domestic policy council in late february  while browner was still in place the house voted to eliminate the director of the office of energy and climate change policy position altogether while the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of obamas czars browner was a particular focus of it representative steve scalise who led the effort said of browner let her leave and take the funding too in the midapril  federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown funding for the position was indeed eliminated as were three other czar roles most of which were similarly vacant obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it but the point was largely moot as the positions in question including the browner one had already been moved inside the domestic policy council return to business and advocacyedit browner rejoined the center for american progress in april  as a distinguished senior fellow and a member of the organizations executive committee she also rejoined the albright firm now known due to merger as the albright stonebridge group as a senior counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact she

power as a means to combat climate change in that role she has said that we cant take a carbonfree source of energy off the table she has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier she

testimony epa testimony statements statement of the honorable carol m browner statement of the honorable carol m browner january   statement of the honorable carol m browner administrator us environmental protection agency before the committee on finance united states senate january   thank you mr chairman and other members of the committee for inviting me here to discuss this administrations global environmental objectives epas international mission and our role in defining the interface between trade and environment policies i would like to take this opportunity to identify for the committee the goals of our strong international program and the many ways we work to achieve those goals both within and outside the trade agenda i hope to assist you in attaining an appreciation for epas interest in trade and environment issues and to make progress towards a common approach for developing a new consensus on these issues epas international mission epa is a leader in the nations efforts to protect and preserve public health and the vitality of natural ecosystems in this country my agency is committed to achieving these goals by reducing risks to human health and the environment preventing pollution and fostering environmentally sound and sustainable economic development in a costeffective and efficient manner international cooperation is a key element in epas ability to achieve this mission the united states faces significant challenges in protecting the health of its citizens and its natural resources from environmental hazards in todays world since pollution does not honor national boundaries overcoming these challenges requires the cooperation of other countries some examples include crossborder air water and waste pollution from mexico canada and other areas affect the health environment and wellbeing of american citizens living along borders as well as other areas of the united states improper use of chemicals abroad can affect the safety of food and other products imported into the united states health and environmental benefits resulting from the multibillion dollar us investment by industry under the clean air act to reduce emissions of stratospheric ozone depleting compounds could be undermined by failure to control production or use of these chemicals in other countries such as china india or russia pollution of the marine environment in the wider caribbean region can damage us fisheries and coral reefs and jeopardize tourism and other livelihoods pollution of the oceans and irreversible loss of species and habitat worldwide damage natural systems critical to our wellbeing and quality of life and deprive us of commercially valuable and potentially lifesaving genetic materials the longrange transport of persistent organic pollutants like ddt chlordane and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs can adversely affect health and environment in the united states one of the major goals of epas strategic plan under the government performance and results act is aimed at reducing global risks that affect health and environment in the united states epas efforts under this goal are grouped in five major areas  protecting north american ecosystems including marine and arctic environments  meeting us commitments under the un framework convention on climate change  reducing stratospheric ozone depletion in conformance with us commitments under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer  protecting public health and ecosystems from persistent organic pollutants that circulate at global and regional scales and  strengthening environmental protection worldwide and achieving cleaner and moreeffective environmental protection in the united states epas international environmental programs help protect the health and environment of american citizens they enlist the cooperation of other nations in reducing transboundary and global environmental threats to the united states and reduce the cost of the nations environmental protection they also serve the nations broad foreign policy economic and national security interests reducing environmental threats along our borders over half of the us population lives in the  states that form our borders with mexico and canada nowhere are the benefits of epas international programs more apparent than along our common borders with mexico and canada and in the arctic and wider caribbean region in  this administration concluded the usmexico border environmental cooperation agreement which created the border environmental cooperation commission becc and the north american development bank nadbank in addition the administration negotiated the north american agreement on environmental cooperation these efforts have led to specific environmental gains in all three countries nafta highlighted the problems unique to the usmexico border and as a result congress border state legislators federal and state agencies have devoted their efforts and resources to effectively resolving these problems in strong cooperation with mexico without interfering with the trade agenda   the becc and nadbank have been established to certify and fund environmental infrastructure projects fifteen becccertified projects worth a combined  million and serving  million us and mexican citizens are now under construction or complete the institutions using their own and epa resources are developing additional projects for future construction   since  epa has provided  million for border drinking water and wastewater infrastructure construction as well as  million specifically for colonias water facilities   border xxi the binational border environment plan brings together many federal state and local agencies on both sides of the border as well as tribal entities and nongovernment organizations to ensure cooperation to maximize resources and avoid duplicative efforts in advancing the goal of sustainable development border xxi emphasizes public involvement in its development and implementation and works to build capacity and decentralize environmental management   the second phase of border xxi includes efforts to address pressing health and natural resource needs the addition of the environmental health the natural resources and the environmental information resources workgroups to the border xxi program resulted in the participation of health and human services department and the department of interior   the ten border states us and mexico are cooperating by developing statetostate strategic plans to address the degradation of the border environment   border xxi places an emphasis on measuring the progress of border environmental efforts which has resulted in a process to develop environmental indicators for the usmexico border area the first indicators report was released in july    a binational joint advisory committee representing various sectors of the public was established to provide recommendations to the air workgroup on air pollution improvement efforts in the el pasociudad juarezdo�a ana county air basin   the united states has jointly developed an emissions inventory methodology with mexico which mexico adopted as a result mexico is now systematically developing compatible air pollution emission inventories all over the country including cities along the border   continuous air monitoring data is now being collected in three priority areasel pasojuarezsunland park imperialmexicali and san diegotijuana   the good neighbor environmental board and region  of the mexican national advisory council for sustainable developmentthe two national public advisory committees on usmexico border issuesare working individually and jointly to develop recommendations on a number of sustainable development policy issues   regional subgroups such as the environmental enforcement and compliance subgroups are being established along the border to facilitate the cooperation of various entities working in the border area on specific projects the regional subgroups also allow opportunities for the public to have input into environmental improvements   fourteen sister city pairs along the border are developing joint contingency plans for chemical emergency response to date three pairs of sister cities have developed and signed binational joint plans and several others are preparing or finalizing their plans   mexican and us federal entities are cooperating in the area of environmental enforcement and compliance through the sharing of information and through training and technical and legal consultations on many aspects in particular voluntary environmental compliance including environmental auditing and adoption of pollution prevention practices and technologies is promoted by environmental agencies on both sides of the border   many efforts have been made to expand availability of environmental information and to increase public participation in environmental decision making in the border area among these efforts is the creation of a bilingual border xxi web site as a mechanism to increase public access to information longstanding cooperation with canada has resulted in corresponding environmental gains along our northern border benefitting from the great lakes water quality agreement and other cooperative agreements mercury levels in fish in lakes michigan huron and erie have dropped by more than  percent since  phosphorous loadings into lake erie decreased by more than  percent over the same time period improving water quality and raising fish stocks epa and environment canada are working closely with public and private interests on both sides of the border to eliminate health and environmental risks from persistent organic pollutants in the great lakes us and canadian efforts to achieve the goals of the uscanada air quality agreement resulted in reductions of sulfate wet deposition over eastern north america by over  percent of  levels us and canadian federal british columbia provincial and washington state agencies are cooperating to achieve shared goals for the puget soundstraits of georgia basin ecoregion their top four priorities are minimizing habitat loss protecting marine plants and animals minimizing introduction of nonnative species and creating marine protected areas joint contingency planning with mexico and canada is helping prevent and ensure appropriate response capabilities for chemical accidents or other hazardous spills along inland borders reducing global and regional environmental risk global threats have local effects since they can affect the health and wellbeing of every us citizen depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer increases the amount of the suns ultraviolet radiation reaching the earths surface thereby increasing risk of skin cancer cataracts and suppression of human immune systems pollution of the oceans originating in other countries threatens health and environment along us coasts similarly the united states is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change caused by global greenhouse gas emissions even if we are able to reduce our emissions to  levels as called for in the framework convention on climate change we believe there is a delayed effect from already accumulated emissions which will continue to effect global temperatures and result in rises in sea levels through the next century loss of biological diversity is damaging the health of ecosystems and depleting the worlds commercially valuable and potentially lifesaving genetic materials the global ramifications of the nuclear accident at chernobyl underscored us vulnerability to the results of environmental mismanagement in other countries environmental problems like ozone depletion and water pollution also have adverse economic effects for industries like agriculture and fishing the administration is committed to meeting the challenge of these global environmental problems working at the global multilateral regional and bilateral levels epa plays a role in coordination with the department of state in negotiating certain global and regional environmental agreements the agency also in accordance with its statutory authority draws on its policy and technical expertise to implement international agreements and programs on global and regional environmental problems directly affecting the united states the agency was a leading policy and technical voice in the international negotiations on the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer epa was a key participant on the us delegation to many technical working group meetings and had lead responsibility for domestic implementation of the protocol through the promulgation of regulations under the clean air act the agency is also instrumental in carrying out us responsibilities related to the provision of technical assistance to developingcountry parties to the protocol epa is has a leading role in the interagency effort to reduce illegal exports and imports of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs through enforcement cooperation with other countries epa also provides policy and technical leadership in international efforts to implement the framework convention on climate change as well as international agreements to prevent and reduce pollution of the marine environment from dumping vessels and landbased sources the recent agreement under the london convention to ban the sea disposal of radioactive and industrial wastes for example helps protect us coastal areas fisheries and human health through usg activities like the us country studies program and the united states initiative on joint implementation usiji epa assists developing countries in identifying innovative costeffective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions increasing private sector investment in developing countries while enhancing environmental and human health benefits are goals of the usiji the country studies program and related programs these activities stimulate the development and diffusion of clean energyefficient technologies in developing countries while lowering the cost of greenhouse gas reductions to the us industry epa has been a global leader in international efforts to control the longrange transport of persistent organic pollutants such as ddt chlordane and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs the agency recently helped secure international consensus on the need for a legally binding convention on these pollutants such a convention will enlist the cooperation of nations in limiting the production of chemicals long banned or restricted for use in the united states and whose continued use abroad poses a threat to health and environment in this country epa played a major role in international negotiations resulting in the adoption of the prior informed consent pic agreement for the transboundary movement of certain toxic chemicals and pesticides similarly epa has a key role on implementing the global programme of action on landbased sources of marine pollution adopted at the washington conference in  and in negotiations on a landbased marine pollution protocol under the cartagena convention for the wider caribbean region the development and implementation of effective controls on landbased sources of marine pollution such as outfalls and runoff will go far toward advancing important us environmental and economic interests clean beaches and healthy coral reefs for example are very important to the tourist fishing and recreation industries this administration will continue efforts to improve regional environmental cooperation and to build such cooperation arrangements in regions targeted for trade liberalization such as apec and the ftaa in the western hemisphere we are leaders in the follow up to the miami summit action plan and the  bolivia sustainable development summit   in the area of biodiversity usaid is initiating or expanding projects on environmental health and education and on the central american biodiversity corridor a biodiversity internet site in cooperation with undp in the energy sector doe has focused its resources on renewable energy technology exchange and rural electrification   epa and the department of justice are cooperating to develop a network of experts in environmental law and enforcement to explore strengthening laws and regulations in the hemisphere epa and justice are also examining ways to address water issues  both clean drinking water and waste water  and landbased sources of marine pollution   noaa working under a cooperative agreement with usaid is considering the establishment of a marine environment center in the caribbean basin   regarding transparency and enhancing the participation of civil society with our leadership the bolivia summit has mandated the oas to develop an interamerican strategy for public participation in sustainable development policymaking with respect to the asia pacific region our leadership role on environmental issues will continue   the united states has taken the lead on implementing two of the sustainable development initiatives launched at the july  apec environment ministerial    clean production whose goals are to reduce pollution in key industry sectors by promoting appropriate cleaner production technologies policies and practices while also striving to achieve broader adoption of cleaner production technologies through institutional and professional partnerships and    the marine environment whose goals are to develop integrated approaches to coastal management prevent reduce and control marine pollution and manage marine resources in sustainable way the initiative is sustainable cities   the united states is working to integrate environmental issues within the scope of other apec working groups eg the energy working group is looking at issues of energy efficiency and clean technology elevating the quality and reducing the cost of environmental protection in the united states the united states is a world leader in environmental protection with significant expertise residing in both the public and private sectors cooperative research and regulatory development enables the united states to share the costs of environmental protection efforts and to benefit from scientific and technological breakthroughs in other countries thereby elevating the quality and reducing the cost of environmental protection in the united states cooperative research with several countries including canada germany sweden japan china and india has yielded valuable information to the united states at a fraction of the cost of collecting and analyzing the data here in a cooperative study with china for example epa was able to assess the loss of lung function in children due to their exposure to coarse and fine airborne particulate matter joint testing with germany on the development of thermal destruction techniques for hazardous waste saved the us taxpayer millions of dollars and accelerated the us domestic program in this area three to four years shared testing through the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd of over  high production volume chemicals greatly reduces the cost and administrative burden of chemical testing in the united states oecds longstanding test guidelines harmonization program for toxic chemicals data has been expanded to explicitly consider pesticides data thereby leading to even greater resource savings for national regulatory agencies and industry as well as more consistent scientific and regulatory conclusions cooperation with the european union is helping to enhance the effectiveness of ecolabeling as a marketbased environmental policy tool epa is also working with many developed countries in sharing environmental management expertise on new nonregulatory mechanisms for protecting the environment other countries are extremely interested in our experience with voluntary nonregulatory programs like the common sense initiative a multistakeholder approach to environmental protection in addition as epa moves away from the mediumbymedium approach of the past toward a more integrated view of the environment it can learn much from the experience of other countries that have already applied such techniques swedish and dutch authorities for example have been implementing multimedia systems of environmental protection for many years similarly experience in germany and other countries in rehabilitating derelict industrial sites offers valuable lessons for the brownfields program in the united states serving broader national objectives as emphasized by the general accounting office in its recent review of international environmental programs across the us government epas international programs also serve important us economic foreign policy and security interests working closely with other us agencies for example epa has actively supported regional cooperation under the auspices of the middle east peace process multilateral working group including bringing together regional parties to cooperate on reducing risks from pesticides small community wastewater and preventing and responding to chemical accidents or oil spills the agencys emphasis on communitybased environmental management plays an important role in encouraging the development of more responsible participatory decisionmaking in countries around the world reduced environmental problems can relieve pressures for illegal immigration promote economic and political stability and serve other national security interests epas interest in trade and environment issues export credit agencies our national programs dealing with trade and investment abroad should complement the effort to raise the environmental quality and sustainability of the multinational investments made by the us taxpayer at congress direction and with epa technical support the us treasury department has made sure that the lending and guarantee policies of the multilateral development banks assess and address the environmental and social impacts of the projects of their borrowers this is good business as well as sound policy because sustainable growth ensures that the markets for us goods will be there not just tomorrow but also the day after tomorrow for the same reason my agency has supported the development of minimum environmental standards by the us exportimport bank and the effort to harmonize the environmental standards of our major trading partners upward we can all be proud of these examples of global us leadership the process of dialogue has been slow at times disappointingly so the good news is that recent european elections appear to have brought greater receptivity from our friends and competitors to the idea that we should not compete at the expense of the environment environmental technology export promotion technical cooperation has played an important role in foreign policy initiatives in latin america and with mexico china india russia and south africa epas technical assistance and training programs create demand  and markets  for environmental technologies and expertise thereby enhancing commercial opportunities for us business and industry and creating highwage jobs for american citizens senior private sector individuals and groups have recently reaffirmed the key role epas international technology and capacitybuilding programs play in creating commercial opportunities for us suppliers of environmental technologies and expertise in so doing they have differentiated the export assistance supplyside role of the department of commerce exportimport bank and other export promotion agencies from epas role in creating demand for us technologies and expertise through the development of environmental standards institutions and human resource capabilities epas shortterm technical assistance to the royal thai government for example not only helped solve a pressing health and environmental problem in the mae moh valley it also led to the sale of almost  million for usmade air pollution monitoring and control equipment in the report which accompanied epas fy  appropriations bill the senate appropriations committee urged epa to play a stronger role in enhancing opportunities for industry to export environmental technologies to other countries it specifically directed the agency to develop a strategy to coordinate and promote the export of environmental technology and services and coordinate such activities with other federal agencies in response to this appropriations report epa this past october published a report to congress entitled epa strategy for promoting us environmental exports the report noted that epas international initiatives help the us environmental technology sector expand its export base and that epas exportenhancing activities can be grouped into five general categories creating demand for us technologies and services epas international training technical assistance and other capacity building programs help to drive the demand for us environmental goods and services joint funding for environmental training of foreign officials for example has helped strengthen environmental management capabilities worldwide while leading to over  million in sales for small and mediumsized companies in the united states cooperation with other federal agencies epa works with other federal agencies and departments such as exim bank and doc to help match us technology and service providers with opportunities which arise from our capacitybuilding programs epa also participates as a partner in aids asia environmental partnership and cochairs along with doc the environmental trade working group cooperation with the us private sector epa works both with intermediary organizations such as the national association of state development agencies and directly with us private sector firms to organize technology demonstrations in other countries strengthen technology development and dissemination through programs such as the small business innovation research grants and the environmental technology verification etv programs and to direct us businesses toward specialized export assistance at local state federal and international levels strong environmental standards by encouraging the adoption of strong environmental standards at bilateral regional and global levels epa helps to drive the demand for increasingly sophisticated environmental technologies removing international barriers to the flow of environmental goods and services through fora such as nafta apec and the wto epa is working with its partner federal agencies to reduce tariffs for environmental goods and services we are also working with these other agencies to reduce nontariff trade barriers epas reputation as the worlds foremost national environmental agency has been a key element in the success of our international programs equally important however has been our reputation for honesty and objectivity epa is careful to stress that we do not endorse particular private sector firms or seek to promote certain goods or services our programs form a foundation upon which export promotion agencies such as doc and programs such as the asia environmental partnership may build in essence epa helps to foster the rising global demand for environmental technologies our partner agencies help us business to fill the demand the trade institutions in the  state of the union address president clinton said we must ensure that ordinary citizens benefit from trade  a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environmentwe have got to put a human face on the global economy our goal in seeking to ensure that trade negotiations support protection of the environment is to do just that  put a human face on the global economy by ensuring that we continue to protect the health safety and environment of our citizens epa works extensively with the office of the us trade representative ustr particularly its office of environment and natural resources to ensure that us international trade policies are mutually supportive with environmental policies reflecting the administrations continuing commitment to sustainable economic growth with strong health and environmental standards epa is represented on the subcabinet trade policy review group tprg and the trade policy staff committee tpsc coordinated by ustr and responsible for the development of us international trade policy through my agencys participation in the negotiation of the nafta the uruguay round agreements establishing the wto and most recently the ongoing free trade area of the americas ftaa negotiations epa has worked to ensure that us obligations under international trade agreements do not hamper but rather further the ability of federal and state governments to maintain and enforce high levels of domestic environmental protection that we deem appropriate the dispute settlement bodies of trade institutions should not be able to secondguess levels of protection that countries determine to be necessary to protect their citizens president clinton reiterated this goal at the wto th anniversary in may  when he said international trade rules must permit sovereign nations to exercise their right to set protective standards for health safety and the environment and biodiversity as we approach the  wto ministerial to be held in the united states in november we have a platform in the greatest country on earth to inspire our trading partners to fulfill the presidents call for ensuring that we do more to make sure that this new economy lifts living standards around the world and that spirited economic competition among nations never becomes a race to the bottom in environmental protectionswe should level up not down wto rules should be consistent with leveling environmental health or safety standards upwards ie towards more protective standards international harmonization of good laboratory practices test guidelines and mutual acceptance of data for industrial chemicals and pesticides means more efficient data development by industry and greater assurance of the quality of data epa uses in determining acceptable use of these products the mutual acceptance of data for risk assessment purposes must now be expanded beyond countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development to include emerging markets in asia and central and eastern europe epas efforts to promote the leveling up of health and environmental standards improves health and environmental conditions and also protect us business who already must comply with high domestic standards while respecting its international obligations there are other ways to maintain the high levels of health and environmental protection in the united states and to share these levels with other nations the first is to maintain our right to deny entry of products that do not meet our health and environmental standards in order to adequately protect the health of american citizens we must maintain our right to prohibit entry of products  particularly food products  that do not meet our standards certain products eg pesticides foods with pesticide residues must be approved before they can be marketed consistent with our statutory obligations eg fifra tsca ffdca the united states will continue to prohibit the entry or use of these products unless the exporting countryproducer provides information that the product meets our health safety or environmental requirements epa also tries to achieve its goal through its international programs on safe pesticide use which help to improve the quality of the us food supply many offseason fruit and vegetables are imported from developing countries whose health and environmental inspection and regulatory systems are considerably less stringent than those in the united states by working with foreign health and environmental protection agencies and agricultural producers epa is able to promote safer pesticide use and food production practices in countries producing a significant amount of export crops for the us market since  for example epa has provided technical assistance on pesticide management to many countries in central america much of the produce grown in central america is intended for the us market north american agreement on environmental cooperation as you are probably aware i represent the united states in consultation with the other federal agencies on the council of the cec to date the cec has focused its cooperative work program on environmental issues important to the north american region this cooperative work program has been very successful in creating dialogue among our nations fostering the exchange of information and causing the development of cooperative plans of action on many issues last year my counterparts and i began the development of a more comprehensive trade and environment program in the cec intended to build on our project looking at the environmental effects of the nafta increase our understanding of our trade and environment issues generally and specifically work with civil society to find useful solutions the us and its nafta partners have determined that some transboundary environmental issues related to mexico and canada are better addressed on a regional scale through the commission for environmental cooperation cec which was established under the north american agreement on environmental cooperation rather than bilaterally for instance the three parties have developed regional actions plans for the elimination or sound management of ddt mercury pcbs and chlordane and are negotiating procedures to notify and assess transboundary environmental impacts of significant federal actions they are also considering a conservation strategy for north american migratory songbirds the cec has facilitated cooperation among the north american nations on several other issues such as environmental enforcement development of a north american pollutant release inventory regional greenhouse gas emissions trading and regional implementation of global environmental agreements the positive focus on the cooperative work program may have diminished the need for the part v dispute settlement mechanism which could eventually lead to revocation of nafta benefits in fact no country has raised an issue under part v and to our knowledge no government has been subject to public pressure to do so the article  citizens submission process on the other hand has been used many times by ngos in all three countries and is quite successful the ultimate outcome of this process if the cec secretariat decides to take it to completion for any submission is a factual record on an assertion that one government has failed to effectively enforce its domestic environmental law thus the process enables citizens to question the environmental enforcement actions of any government in north america and to get an answer to those questions this leads me to what i find to be one of the most useful aspects of the nafta side agreement the commitment of the three governments to effectively enforce their existing domestic environmental laws i believe the nafta environmental review process was critical to assessing the environmental regimes of our trading partners early in the trade negotiations this review enabled us to enter into the nafta with a better understanding of what the environmental repercussions of that agreement were without imposing any of our own standards abroad the united states is committed both to ensuring that the trade agreements we negotiate are consistent with our environmental objectives and to ensuring that congress and the public are informed about the possible impact of such agreements on the environment at the beginning of the nafta negotiations the administration issued a study evaluating potential environmental effects of a trilateral free trade agreement at the conclusion of both the nafta and the uruguay round negotiations the administration issued a reports describing how environmental issues had been addressed in the agreements and outlining the potential environmental implications of those agreements as the united states has entered into negotiations on new trade agreements we have sought to include mechanisms for considering the environmental implications of those agreements for instance as part of the useu transatlantic economic partnership initiative tep we are creating an environment working group that has been tasked inter alia with informing trade negotiators of the potential impact of other tep negotiations on health safety and environmental interests in addition we have been working with the secretariat of the nafta commission on environmental cooperation on a methodology to identify the environmental effects of trade liberalization multilaterally in the wto committee on trade and environment cte the united states has shared our positive experience with the nafta and the uruguay round reviews and pressed for agreement in the wtocte that governments should review the environmental implications of trade agreements with your support epa stands ready to offer appropriate technical cooperation and assistance to help partners strengthen their environmental regimes transparency and public participation finally the cec demonstrates the value of public participation to other international institutions president clinton in his may speech at the wto proposed that the wto provide a forum where business labour environmental and consumer groups can speak out and help guide further evolution of the wto in my experience an openness to the public benefits international decisionmaking at each of the annual cec council sessions my canadian and mexican counterparts and i spend a few hours in an open meeting with the public to hear their concerns and ideas regarding the implementation of the nafta side agreement so that our decisions are informed by public comment each cec party has established national advisory committees so that each delegation stays in touch with its own public the joint public advisory committee a senior level group that advises all three governments is actually one arm of the cec itself when appropriate representatives of the advisory committees have been invited into the council sessions these types of public participation efforts are useful and should be models for other institutions it is my hope that the wto ministerial to be held on american soil can promote transparency and public participation in a future wto round of negotiations the president has called for an opening of the process at the wto he specifically asks that hearings by the wto be open to the public and all briefs by the parties be made publicly available that the wto provide the opportunity for stakeholders to convey their views such as the ability to file amicus briefs i look forward to a highlevel meeting that brings together the trade and environment ministers in order to provide strong direction on these and other issues important to the environment in the wto and comparable fora let me close by saying that i believe the trade and environment issue needs to be addressed on a dual track we need to tear down barriers open markets and expand trade but at the same time we need to make parallel progress on environmental protection epas international program as described above aims to achieve this parallel progress through technical assistance environmental technology export promotion and international cooperation i appreciate your continued support for these efforts thank you for holding these timely hearings on this very important issue  about ocir

subcommittee which has funded essential environmental programs we have made significant progress in providing a safe healthy environment for the american people during this administration we have also worked with congress to pass important environmental laws and to implement earlier laws to carry out our common goal of stronger environmental protections to cite just a few recent examples     this year as a result of the safe drinking water amendments of  we estimate that  percent of the american population will receive drinking water from community water systems that meet all healthbased standards in effect since  the agency has had remarkable success in carrying out those amendments and to date has not missed a single deadline that congress placed in the law we are honoring the commitments you made in passing this legislation and we are meeting the safe drinking water needs of the american people     because of the action of this subcommittee and particularly your support mr

the clean air act i would like to thank this committee for providing funding to carry out this legislation which provides crucial health protections our fiscal year  budget in the tradition of every previous budget submitted by this administration is based on what the president and vice president have proved over the past six years  that we dont have to choose between environmental protection and economic growth a strong economy and a healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand in hand they are inextricably linked today we have some of the toughest environmental and public health protections in the world and our economy is not only strong it is soaring in  this nation had a record high  billion deficit this year we expect a  billion budget surplus thats progress building on this record of success the clintongore  budget request charts a new course to meet the environmental challenges of the coming century this budget recognizes that protecting our environment is about more than beautiful vistas and scenic rivers and its about more than passing new environmental and public health laws its about protecting our health our air our water our land our food and our children this budget reflects a new american ideal its about neighborhoods protecting where we live and how we live and what we do in the everyday life its about communities  and how we keep them healthy strong and prosperous its about improving the quality of our lives three new landmark initiatives in this budget reflect president clintons and vice president gores commitment to americas communities these initiatives provide significant new innovative financial tools to give communities the flexibility they need to address their most pressing environmental and public health needs they tap into our nations greatest resources  our ingenuity and spirit of collaboration they protect our most precious resource first  our children the better america bonds program puts the agency in the forefront of support for the presidents and vice presidents initiative to build livable american communities this new innovative financial tool is aimed at helping communities address problems associated with urban sprawl  such as traffic congestion lost farmland threatened water quality shrinking parkland and abandoned industrial sites or brownfields this is about flexibility communities can decide for themselves how they will preserve their open spaces protect their water revitalize their blighted urban areas and improve their quality of life the administration proposes federal tax credits that will support  billion in bond authority over five years for investments by state local and tribal governments through this initiative the funds invested by local communities to protect the environment could go farther i urge you to give local communities this flexibility to address their most urgent environmental needs the presidents budget includes  million for a new clean air partnership fund  an initiative that is part of the administrations efforts to clean the nations air and meet the challenge of global warming the clean air partnership fund will promote innovative technology demonstrations to help communities nationwide reduce harmful air pollution and greenhouse gases the fund finances through grants the creation of partnerships among local communities states and tribes the private sector and the federal government there is no requirement to participate these are simply grants designed to finance projects that are locally managed and selfsupporting and that enable communities to achieve their clean air goals sooner the fund will stimulate costeffective pollution control strategies spur technological innovation and leverage substantial nonfederal investment in improved air quality i am very excited to discuss this next issue childrens health i am aware that this is a concern we both share your work on childrens issues as both governor and senator has done much to help ensure that our children are well prepared for a lifetime of achievement reducing childrens exposure to toxins in our environment toxins that can exacerbate asthma is a top priority for the budget before you today and is a central theme in this administrations fy  budget i look forward to finding opportunities for you and i to work together on this very important issue as a start id like to describe the agencys fy  proposal for fighting childhood asthma the agency will take a leadership role as part of an administrationwide effort to fight childhood asthma and

initiatives the presidents budget also continues our work on the nations other environmental and public health priorities last year the president announced a national blueprint to restore and protect our nations rivers lakes and coastal waters  and we made great progress the presidents budget allocates  million for the clean water action plan and related activities to continue our efforts to restore and protect watersheds across the country because polluted runoff is one of the most serious problems facing communities the president proposes another important flexible funding mechanism  this one designed to help communities provide clean water the presidents proposal will allow states greater flexibility to address their most pressing water quality problems polluted runoff from city streets suburban lawns and rural areas the proposal will give states for the first time the option to set aside up to  percent or as much as  million of their fy  clean water state revolving fund allotment for grants to implement nonpoint source pollution and estuary management projects we will need the authority to allow states to set aside these funds for this statemanaged grant program i look forward to working with congress to provide this authority so that we can implement this important new funding mechanism in addition the presidents budget provides a combined  billion for the state revolving funds srf of which  million funds the clean water srf and  million funds the drinking water srf the drinking water srf increases from last year and will help achieve the administrations goal of capitalizing the drinking water srf until states can provide an average of  million in annual financial assistance for drinking water projects the clean water srf request is part of the administrations overall capitalization plan to ensure states can provide an average of  billion a year in financial assistance for water quality projects we plan to continue capitalization of the clean water srf until this goal is met i would like to note that almost  billion in federal capitalization grants have been provided so far to the clean water srf or almost  more than originally authorized the presidents budget invests approximately  million at epa and  billion governmentwide to help reduce the pollution that causes global warming this program will continue the administrations efforts to address the challenge of climate change through innovative costeffective partnerships with businesses schools states and local governments that voluntarily lower energy use  and energy bills for everyone the climate change technology initiative proposed by the president this year also offers tax credits for consumers who purchase fuel efficient cars homes appliances and other energyefficient products it also includes increased spending on research to develop new cleaner technologies in areas like the partnership for a new generation of vehicles and the partnership for advancing technology in housing the presidents budget invests  billion in superfund to continue cleanup of toxic waste sites the agency plans to complete clean up construction at  sites for a

brownfields program including  million for the brownfields revolving loan fund which helps communities leverage funds for actual cleanup of brownfield sites through  the agency will have funded brownfields site assessment pilots in  communities across our great nation of special importance in this budget proposal is our request to increase the agencys operating programs by five percent over the fy  enacted level this budget provides  billion for the operating programs which include most of the agencys research regulatory and enforcement programs and funds our partnership programs with states tribes and local governments the operating programs which have grown  percent during this administration represent the backbone of the nations efforts to protect public health and the environment through sound science standard setting and enforcement it is through these programs that the agency works to ensure that our water is pure our air is clean and our food is safe i cannot emphasize enough the important contribution the operating programs make to the agencys ability to meet the expectations of the american public for a safe healthy environment as part of these important operating programs the president requests  million for the chemical righttoknow program this includes  million for the chemical righttoknow initiative to focus on accelerating the screening and testing of the  highest production volume chemicals used in the us we will conduct this initiative through a voluntary industry challenge program and a series of test rules for those data not obtained

increase protection to a larger number of more sensitive populations such as children and the elderly the budget request for the mexican border is  million a  million increase for projects there the agency will use these resources for direct grant assistance intended to address the environmental and public health problems associated with untreated industrial and municipal sewage on the border
