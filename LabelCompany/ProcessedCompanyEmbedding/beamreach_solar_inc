 million in funding later the former solexel focuses on specialty silicon solar panels by eric wesoff june   more than  million in funding later the former solexel focuses on specialty silicon solar panels by eric wesoff june    beamreach solar known as solexel for the last nine years has a new lightweight photovoltaic module a new ceo and a new business plan to go along with its new name and the  million in venture capital it has spent so far the first time the company unstealthed in  it was focusing on its thinsilicon technology and looking to massproduce micronthick highperformance lowcost monocrystalline solar cells using a liftoff technology based on a reusable template and a porous silicon substrate the startup hit an nrelcertified cell efficiency of  percent in  with its back contact cell solexel aimed to ship percentefficient photovoltaic modules at a cost of  per watt by  that didnt happen the newly christened beamreach is still a pv cell manufacturer but the companys initial product is a bit of a pivot its going after the almostaclichébynow underserved commercial and industrial rooftop market with a lightweight easytoinstall module we spoke with the company in advance of its product unveiling at intersolar europe this week mark kerstens newly promoted to the role of ceo at beamreach told gtm the system is much lighter thana conventional system thanks to the use of thinner front sheet glass  mm instead of more commonly used  mm the use of a composite material for the frame and the integrated mounting structureand most importantly the adhesion method to the lowslope commercial rooftop surface as a result there is no need for the use of heavy ballast pavers patio blocks etcor roof penetrations kerstens added this light weight can be achieved both with thirdpartysourced cells such as the frontcontact perc cells that we’re using in the product that we’re planning to start shipping in q as well as with our proprietary backcontact monocrystalline silicon cells he noted the beamreach product uses four diodes instead of the more commonly used threediode configuration the two bottom rows of the panel are each on their own diode  this reduces the impact of rowtorow shading we anticipate deploying intramodule electronics in products that are targeting the residential market eg buildingintegrated solar tiles and shingles in  going commercial addressing soft costs beamreachs module economics and performance goals might have been convincing in  but today when first solar the thinfilm solar leader has manufacturing lines in malaysia producing panels below  per watt at more than  percent efficiency beamreach needs to differentiate rather than take on fslr china module inc or sunpower headon can light weight make the difference in commercial solar the startup claims that up to  percent of today’s commercial roofs cannot support conventional pv panels resulting in a massive untapped commercial market for solar power a report from the photovoltaic manufacturing consortium backs that up in  selected subsegments over  million sq ft of commercial building roof space in new york state is potentially limited to   psf of additional load  over  million is limited to   psf of additional load certainly the commercial market is finally ready to grow in the recently published report us commercial solar landscape  gtm research forecasts the us commercial solar market to rebound and nearly triple in size by  this growth will be driven by the extension of the federal investment tax credit the growing adoption of solar among national corporations the increasing availability of financing for small commercial systems and an expanding market for community solar and rather than take on commodity modules beamreach addresses a bigger costreduction target soft costs kerstens notes that the installation requires no tools and no grounding with the promise of lower labor costs and savings on wire management grounding design and shipping kerstens also claims that install time is five times faster than with a conventional system he said no one has seen anything like it adding labor cost is reduced dramatically heres a video that compares installation time of beamreach modules to conventional racking when beamreach was a thinsilicon or highefficiency player it might have been competing against sunpower silevo suniva tetrasun  technologies or crystal solar but with this shift beamreach looks a bit like tenksolar which offers highefficiency photovoltaic systems for commercial rooftops carports and groundmount projects or sunpower with its integrated solution scott moskowitz ace solar balanceofsystem analyst with gtm research had this to say the sprint solution is differentiated by its weight characteristics but beamreach is additionally part of a larger trend to integrate pv modules and racking for the purpose of accelerating installation and lowering overall system cost weve

about how your location roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below what rebates solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in california what solar incentives and tax credits are available in california the main incentives to install solar in california is the  federal solar tax credit and the net metering law the upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers however the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates     net metering in california the california public utility commission voted by a narrow majority of  to  to extend the ability of residential energy customers in california to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production whilst this didnt affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in california it was a massive win for the millions of californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels the reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power this is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted it means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility known as a net metering agreement where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power usually for  or  years each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature to see more visit wwwcpuccagovgeneralaspxid     is a purchase lease or ppa agreement best generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home however this is not always the case if you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the  federal solar tax credit in this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit     what is the payback period from installing solar panels in california the payback period from installing solar panels in california is usually between  and  years depending on the size of the system the brand of solar panels you buy the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system this represents an excellent low risk investment     why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in california as california has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power however working this out can be difficult for two reasons firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated the second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices with most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases california solar calculator regardless of what you want to know about the economics of installing
