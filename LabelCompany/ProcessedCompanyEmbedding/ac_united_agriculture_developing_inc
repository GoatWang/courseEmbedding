internationally is intense we will face direct competition by other seed companies including small familyowned businesses as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of chemical pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies many of which have substantially greater resources than we do we will initially be a small competitor in the market our principal larger competitors will be monsanto syngenta limagrain bejo china national seed group co ltd we intend to compete with these larger competitors be offering more flexibility and quicker turnaround time when potential customers or distributors are asking for new seed varieties there are about  small to midsize local chinese companies that are also importing foreign seeds with which we will also compete we believe that our management’s research on the american seed supplier market and contacts we have made with the american supplier market in connection with the two trial businesses they established as described above will give us a competitive advantage over these competitors however many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial marketing and human resources than we do as a result these competitors may · succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products or potential products · devote greater resources to developing marketing or selling their products · respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances which could render our products or potential products obsolete or less preferable · obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize potential products we might otherwise develop · withstand price competition more successfully than we can · establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers and · take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can company description we are a development stage company our business will be the sale of vegetable seeds in all areas of the world focusing initially on china we have not yet sold any of these products we will sell the following types of vegetable seeds broccoli squash and cabbage we will acquire these seeds from various suppliers in the united states since our inception we have engaged in the following significant operating activities · company set
