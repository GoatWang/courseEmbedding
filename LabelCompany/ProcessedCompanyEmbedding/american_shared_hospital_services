overview radiosurgery pbrt imrtigrt or proton beam radiation therapy let us help you acquire pbrt potentially the most effective cancer treatment available proton beam radiation therapy the american cancer society estimates that  million people in the united states are diagnosed with cancer each year although significant strides have been made in reducing the mortality rate and morbidity caused by cancer cancer remains the second leading killer of americans radiation therapy a noninvasive treatment has been a significant factor in improving the outcomes of patients afflicted with cancer as many as  of cancer patients receive a form of radiation therapy during their course of treatment proton beam radiation therapy pbrt is emerging as the next treatment option that can make a significant impact in our fight against cancer pbrt is a precise form of radiation treatment that treats tumors with protons instead of photons used in conventional radiation therapy protons release almost all of their energy in a burst of radiation delivered directly to the tumor since less of a dose is delivered to surrounding healthy tissue this technology is particularly useful for targeting tumors close to sensitive areas and in treating children by minimizing damage to healthy tissue and surrounding organs proton treatment is highly successful and results in fewer sideeffects currently pbrt treats prostate eye cranialspinal head and neck lung liver breast tumors and is especially useful in pediatric cases additionally the benefits of pbrt for colorectal and pancreatic cancers are being explored the pbrt systems in use today were extremely expensive to build since the technology required multistory facilities therefore there are only about  pbrt centers worldwide with six in the united states which limits patient access to this superior technology singleroom pbrt rooms are currently in development and us fda approval is expected in the near future if you are interested in this cuttingedge
