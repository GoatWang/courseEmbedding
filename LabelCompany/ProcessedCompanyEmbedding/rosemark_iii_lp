district lorain county decided december   attorneys appearing for the case donald robinson lorain county assistant prosecuting attorney for appellee gold rotatori  schwartz co lpa gerald s gold and john s pyle for appellant reece presiding judge appellant dorian rosemark appeals from the judgment order of the court of common pleas denying his motion to vacate his guilty plea i appellant dorian rosemark was indicted on a charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs rosemark pleaded guilty to the charge on the date of trial january   sentencing was scheduled for march   after twice requesting to have the sentencing date continued rosemark moved to vacate his guilty plea on march   rosemarks motion was heard by the trial court on april   the trial court denied the motion on october   on october   the court sentenced rosemark to a term of incarceration for five to twentyfive years this appeal followed ii in his sole assignment of error rosemark asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate his guilty plea we reject this argument a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be freely and liberally granted nevertheless it must be recognized that a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing state v xie   ohio std    ned   see also state v barnett   ohio appd    ned   determining whether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea is a matter within the trial courts sound discretion xie supra at   ned at  citing state v peterseim   ohio appd   ood   ned  absent an abuse of discretion the trial courts decision must be affirmed xie  ohio std at   ned at  in order to find an abuse of discretion we must find that the trial court acted unjustly or unfairly that its ruling was unreasonable arbitrary or unconscionable id at   ned at  where a defendant  is represented by competent counsel  is given a full hearing before entering the plea and  is given a hearing on the motion to withdraw during which the court considers the defendants arguments in support of the motion the trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying the plea withdrawal peterseim supra  ohio appd at   ned at  see also state v lockett mar   summit app no  unreported  wl  these elements were met in rosemarks case rosemark was represented by competent counsel throughout the proceedings the following occurred at the hearing when rosemark pleaded guilty the court mr rosemark ill ask at this time how do you plead to the charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs a felony of the first degree the defendant guilty the court all right do you understand that that charge carries with it a term of incarceration an indefinite term of incarceration of not less than four five six or seven years to a maximum of  years in prison the defendant yes your honor the court do you also understand that that charge carries five years of actual incarceration which means that it is not probationable and that the court must order that you serve a minimum of five years actual incarceration do you understand that the defendant yes your honor the court there is also a possible fine up to  however there is a mandatory fine of  so in other words the court must impose a fine of at least  do you understand that the defendant yes yes sir the court    you have a constitutional right to a jury trial and when you plead guilty you waive that is you give up your right to a jury trial do you understand that the defendant yes sir the court if a trial were held the state of ohio could bring witnesses in who may testify against you at that trial then you would have the opportunity to face question and cross examine those witnesses however when you plead guilty you give up the opportunity to face and cross examine your accusers do you understand the defendant yes sir the court similarly at a trial you could compel witnesses to come to court by subpoenaing them and those witnesses may testify favorably to you but by pleading guilty you waive the opportunity to have witnesses appear and testify on your behalf do you understand the defendant yes sir the court now if a trial were held before the state of ohio could be successful and obtain a conviction the state would have to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that is no longer necessary when you plead guilty because you admit to the charge do you understand the defendant yes sir the court and lastly if that trial were held you could not be forced to testify against yourself are you aware you have that right the defendant yes    the court has anyone forced you in any way to plead guilty in this case the defendant no sir the court has anyone threatened you causing you to plead guilty the defendant no sir    the court    at this time im going to ask that the prosecutor offer a brief statement of facts mr robinson yes your honor on september th  at approximately  pm the defendant contacted detective leiby from the elyria police department defendant made a phone call from the area of east avenue—east—im sorry th avenue and middle avenue in elyria ohio at which time the defendant offered to sell detective leiby a sheet of lsd a sheet of lsd is the equivalent of  hits or had  hits of lsd on it which is greater than three times the bulk in exchange for  lsd is a schedule i drug the court fine mr rosemark youve heard the statement of the prosecutor is it substantially correct the defendant yes your honor    the court    having reviewed with you in open court all of your rights im going to ask you now for the final time how do you plead to the one charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs a felony of the first degree the defendant guilty the court im going to accept your plea of guilty i believe you entered it knowingly voluntarily and intelligently rosemark also confirmed before the court that he signed a plea sheet entering a plea of guilty he stated that he understood the implications of signing the plea sheet the court considered evidence regarding rosemarks motion to withdraw his guilty plea at a hearing on april   after reviewing the evidence presented at this hearing the court decided that rosemark had entered his plea knowingly voluntarily and intelligently and refused to vacate his guilty plea our review of the record does not support a conclusion that the court abused its discretion in making that determination rosemark further contends the court erred in refusing to vacate his plea because the plea was induced by threats of physical harm made to him by a detective on the elyria police force our review of the alleged threatening statements reveals that the detective made the statements with regard to rosemarks cooperation with the police the statements referred to the possible implications of prison life for rosemark and certainly could not be construed as an inducement to plead guilty and face a sure prison term thus rosemarks contention that his plea was induced by threats lacks merit from the evidence presented we cannot hold that the trial court acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner in denying rosemarks motion to withdraw his guilty plea the record does not reflect incompetent representation by rosemarks counsel the record does reflect a thorough inquiry by the court prior to its acceptance of rosemarks plea and consideration of his arguments to vacate the plea accordingly rosemarks sole assignment of error is overruled iii the assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court denying rosemarks motion to vacate his guilty plea is affirmed judgment affirmed dickinson and slaby jj concur comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no

laforest  husband  and marcia laforest  wife  collectively the laforests  appeal the trial court s award of damages to rosemark homes of south bend inc  rosemark  raising the following issues i whether the trial court on remand erred in awarding damages where there was insufficient evidence that the damages were the natural foreseeable and proximate result of the laforests breach of contract ii whether the trial court on remand which was presided over by a judge other than the original trier of fact erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing for the purposes of calculating and itemizing rosemark s damages iii whether the trial court on remand erred in scheduling a hearing to determine rosemark s appellate attorney fees rosemark in turn counterclaims and raises the following issue iv whether the trial court on remand erred by omitting closing costs in the form of realtor fees and real property taxes from rosemark s damage award we affirm in part reverse in part and remand facts and procedural history this is the second appeal in this case this court s prior memorandum decision was rendered on september   and set forth the underlying facts as follows in the spring of  husband s employer reassigned him from new jersey to south bend indiana wife remained in new jersey until husband found a new home in late june  husband discussed with rosemark vice president mike everett a fourbedroom home that was to be built on lot number  in westwood hills and featured in a builders showcase in september  husband toured a similar fourbedroom home built by rosemark and sent pictures and plans to wife  the laforests requested several modifications to the original plan including the transformation of a fourth bedroom into an open loft on july   the laforests and rosemark signed a construction agreement and general building specifications which incorporated the modifications and specified that the home was to be ready for possession on september   the agreement also required that any additions or changes be made in writing on august   the laforests satisfied the down payment requirement of  during the construction of the home the laforests objected to the following the siding was brentwood vinyl instead of barkwood vinyl the chimney chase was made of onehalf brick laminate instead of full brick rosemark did not install a plastic air barrier over the insulation in the basement rosemark constructed a different style of front porch than that specified by the contract and rosemark constructed a different style of screened porch and deck than that specified by the contract rosemark and the laforests discussed each of these changes the laforests orally approved these changes but refused to sign written reductions of these changes in early september  the laforests learned that rosemark had installed a septic tank approved for a threebedroom home on september   the laforests provided rosemark with a list of complaints when no agreement was reached the laforests refused to purchase the home on june   the laforests filed a complaint alleging conversion seeking recovery of earnest money in the amount of  paid on the contract for construction of the home and giving notice of lis pendens against the subject property on august   rosemark filed its reply counterclaim and motion to dismiss the conversion claim and lis pendens notice rosemark s counterclaim sought damages for loss of income costs incurred for maintaining the property costs associated with the resale of the home and other expenses incurred due to the breach     in april  the trial court released  from an escrow fund to rosemark laforest v rosemark homes of south bend inc no acv slip op at  ind ct app sept   appellant s app at   rosemark requested total damages in the amount of  which in part consisted of  for loss of income from the sale of the house  in interest payments on the mortgage for the property  in attorney fees builders insurance maintenance and landscape expenditures  the matter was tried to the bench and on june   the trial court entered judgment finding for rosemark both on the laforests complaint and on rosemark s counterclaim without itemizing rosemark s damages the trial court awarded rosemark  in damages which when added to the  that rosemark had previously been paid totaled  rosemark filed a motion to correct error seeking to modify the order from  to  arguing that the latter amount was the actual loss it had incurred this modification would have awarded rosemark  in damages two days later the laforests also filed a motion to correct error seeking to vacate and modify the judgment against them and contending that rosemark failed to build the home in accordance with the construction specifications which released them from the obligation to purchase the home following a hearing the trial court denied both motions in september  the laforests appealed and rosemark filed a crossappeal in a memorandum decision dated september   this court affirmed the trial court s judgment against the laforests in the breach of contract claim and affirmed the trial court s decision to enter damages in favor of rosemark however finding that the damage award was outside the scope of the evidence our court ordered the case remanded for recalculation and itemization of damages the laforests filed a petition for rehearing which our court denied thereafter on april   our supreme court denied the laforests petition to transfer on remand with a different judge presiding the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions thereon and awarded rosemark  this amount was in addition to the  that rosemark had been previously paid for a total payment of  the  laforests now appeal and rosemark counterclaims additional facts will be added as necessary discussion and decision i damages the laforests challenge the trial court s order on remand to pay rosemark  in damages our review of an award of damages is limited je stone tree service inc v bolger  ned   ind ct app  we do not reweigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses and we will consider only the evidence favorable to the award id abbey villas dev corp v site contractors inc  ned   ind ct app  trans denied a damage award must be supported by probative evidence and cannot be based on mere speculation conjecture or surmise bolger  ned at  a party injured by a breach of contract is limited in its recovery to the loss actually suffered and may not be placed in a better position than it would have enjoyed if the breach had not occurred id thus a damage award must be referenced to some fairly defined standard such as cost of repair market value established experience rental value loss of use loss of profits or direct inference from known circumstances abbey villas  ned at  citing d bldgs inc v palmore  ned   ind ct app  we will reverse an award only when it is not within the scope of the evidence before the finder of fact id in our september   memorandum decision a panel of this court noted  rosemark identifies six categories of damages and corresponding evidence to justify its claim for additional compensation sic  loss of income from the original purchase price and the resale value  maintenance of the property costs  payment of interest on loans for builder financing  sic insurance  tax liability  costs associated with the february  closing and  attorneys fees appellee s br at  after subtracting the  already granted to rosemark the remaining damages calculated by rosemark total  we take issue with the inclusion of the february  closing costs because rosemark would have incurred similar costs even if the laforests had purchased the home the remaining damages however are supported by the evidence and are the natural foreseeable and proximate consequence of the laforests breach although we do not endorse the precise amount that rosemark requests we do agree with its contention that its damages award is clearly outside the scope of the evidence we therefore remand with instructions to recalculate rosemark s damages consistent with this opinion laforest slip op at  appellant s app at  on remand the trial court itemized rosemark s requested damages as follows a maintenance costs totaling  ª  in payments for electricity from  thru  ª  in payments for gas from  thru  ª  in landscape maintenance from  thru  ª  in housecleaning from  thru  ª  in interior touchup work on  and  ª   for light bulbs and other maintenance supplies b payment of interest on loans for building financing by james r lewis totaling  ª  which represents standard federal loan interest from  thru  c insurance costs totaling  ª  in payments made to builder s risk insurance from  thru  d tax liability totaling  ª  in additional taxes owed by james r lewis due to loans  e loss of income due to resale totaling  ª  representing the original contract price plus agreed extras  less the sale price on   f litigation expenses totaling  ª  in trial attorney s fees ª  representing onehalf of    mediator fees ª  in deposition costs to st clair court reporting ª  in deposition costs to holle and associates ª  in bookkeeping accounting fees g closing costs totaling  ª  representing the closing costs when the house was sold on  the foregoing expenses total the sum of  appellant s app at  thereafter the trial court awarded rosemark all of its claimed damages with the exception of the closing costs that our court had previously ruled to be improper the damage award was  but since the laforests had already paid  the trial court ordered the laforests to pay  we consider separately each element of the trial court s damage award the trial court found probative evidence that rosemark  incurred  in damages due to resale which was the difference between the original price of  minus the february  sale price of   incurred  in mortgage interest expenses  and  expended  in insurance costs the trial court also found that under the terms of the construction agreement rosemark was entitled to recover  we note that while statutory prejudgment interest here may have been a more appropriate measure of interest damages statutory prejudgment interest would exceed this amount see ic   attorney fees in the amount  after carefully reviewing the record before us we agree that these damages were within the scope of the evidence presented on remand the trial court also found probative evidence that rosemark was entitled to damages of  for maintenance costs and litigation costs of  after reviewing the record before us we find that the evidence supports the award of  in maintenance costs  and  in litigation expenses  finally the trial court allowed damages in the sum of  for additional personal taxes owed by james r lewis a principal in rosemark we disallow such damages because they are neither explained nor documented in the record nor were they shown to be reasonably foreseeable or otherwise within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into their contract ii hearing on remand the laforests next contend that the trial court on remand abused its discretion by failing to order a new trial on the issue of damages indiana trial rule a allows a successor judge to perform any posttrial duties that the judge who conducted the trial or hearing could have performed however there are instances in which the successor judge s failure to preside at trial renders him illequipped to perform the functions of the regular trial judge holmes v holmes  ned   ind ct app  trans denied tr  specifically we disallow the expenses for light bulbs of  because the invoice was dated after the date of resale of the residence and this discrepancy is unexplained in the record paint touchup costs of  since there is no explanation why these costs would not have been covered by warranty landscaping charges of  for removing dead trees and the planting of new trees shrubs and flowers since these costs are unexplained in the record and cleaning costs of  since they are disproportionate and unexplained in the record  a therefore also contemplates if a judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason he may in his discretion grant a new trial or new hearing in whole or in part id in these instances the discretion to conduct a new hearing or trial is a privilege allowed a judge within the confines of justice to decide and act in accordance with what is fair and equitable id quoting urbanational developers inc v shamrock eng g inc  ind app    ned    here at the request of the laforests counsel the trial court on remand held a hearing to allow counsel for each party to explain why claimed damages should or should not be allowed this hearing resulted in a twentyfivepage transcript thereafter the trial court based its determination of damages on guidance from our court s memorandum decision exhibits from the original trial and the information he obtained during the hearing on remand further in the interest of efficiency it was reasonable for the trial court to have the attorneys review the evidence concerning damages rather than allow the individual parties to testify the trial court acted within its discretion when it decided on a damage award without holding a new trial id iii attorney fees the laforests contend that the trial court erred in scheduling a hearing for the purpose of determining rosemark s appellate attorney fees for the  appeal when rosemark failed to request an award of appellate attorney fees in either the trial court or this court prior to our  decision rosemark counters that because the construction agreement provides for an  we disallow the bookkeeping expense of  which is not explained in the record  award of attorney fees to the prevailing party it is also entitled to appellate attorney fees appellee s brief at  the general rule in indiana and other states is that each party to litigation must pay his own attorney fees however an award of attorney fees may be authorized by contract rule statute or agreement marionadams school corp v boone  ned   ind ct app  quoting morgan county v ferguson  ned   ind ct app  citation omitted here the construction agreement provided should any litigation be brought regarding the project or this construction agreement the contractor is entitled to recover his attorney fees from the buyer should he prevail appellant s app at  for many years our court denied appellate attorney fees in cases where attorney fees were provided for in a contract provision seibert v mock  ned   ind ct app  we viewed an award of attorney fees as merged in the judgment and not available for appellate fees id citing mccormick v falls city bank  f  th cir more recently we have recognized the parties to such a contract intended to indemnify the injured party and have excepted appellate attorney fees from the general rule of merger on equitable principles id citing radio distrib v nat l bank  trust  ned   ind ct app  the preferred procedure for requesting appellate fees is to timely file a petition for allowance of attorney fees with the trial court after appellate proceedings have initiated vazquez v dulios  ned   ind ct app  without citation to authority the laforests contend that to be timely filed the petition for  attorney fees must also be filed prior to the appellate court having rendered its opinion we find no support for this contention indiana appellate rule  provides for the assessment of costs on appeal indiana cpa soc y inc v gomembers inc  ned   ind ct app  commercial coin laundry systems v enneking  ned   ind ct app  costs include the filing fee the cost of preparing the record on appeal postage and additional items as permitted by law indiana cpa soc y  ned at  quoting app r b as such attorney fees are sometimes permitted under this rule id enneking  ned at  appellate rule a provides upon a motion by any party within sixty  days after the final decision of the court of appeals or supreme court the clerk shall tax costs under this rule while recognizing that attorney fees are not always considered costs we find persuasive the timing set forth in this rule by the laforests own admission rosemark did not request appellate attorney fees until it filed its request for hearing on october   four days after this court rendered its opinion and remanded the case to the trial court appellant s brief at  as such the trial court was within its discretion to conclude that appellate attorney fees could be awarded the trial court did not err in deferring the consideration of appellate attorney fees until this matter is returned to the trial court s jurisdiction on remand iv closing costs rosemark finally contends that the trial court erred in omitting from its damage award closing costs in the form of realtor fees and real property taxes specifically rosemark  argues that it would not have incurred the realtor fee and property taxes if the laforests had not breached the contract in their response to rosemark s crossappeal the laforests counter that the law of the case bars rosemark s argument we agree the laforests argue that our court s september   determination that closing costs were excluded from the calculation of damages was the law of the case under the law of the case doctrine an appellate court s determination of a legal issue is binding both on the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal given the same case with substantially the same facts boonville convalescent ctr inc v cloverleaf healthcare servs inc  ned   ind ct app  trans denied  citing montgomery v trisler  ned   ind ct app  trans denied to invoke the law of the case doctrine matters decided in the prior appeal clearly must appear to be the only possible construction of an opinion in our  memorandum decision we determined that closing costs would not be included in the claimed damages rosemark however failed to appeal our decision that closing costs were excluded from the damage award as such our court s determination on closing costs was left unchallenged while recognizing that the law of the case doctrine is discretionary we fail to find any extraordinary circumstance that could persuade us to revisit the already decided issue of closing costs and hold rosemark may not recover closing costs here affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded   on july   rosemark filed a motion for appellate attorney fees the motion requested that the court order that this matter be remanded to the trial court for determination of rosemark homes  sharpnack j and mathias j concur appellate attorney fees after the court of appeals has ruled on the appeal of this matter rosemark failed to specify whether the requested fees were for the first or second appeal our court held the

perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments

perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments
