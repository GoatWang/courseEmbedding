drugs use of the red cross symboledit flag of the red cross further information emblems of the international red cross and red crescent movement § use of the emblems johnson  johnson registered the red cross as a us trademark for medicinal and surgical plasters in  and has used the design since  the geneva conventions which reserved the red cross emblem for specific uses were first approved in

clause in this law now  usc  permits this preexisting uses of the red cross to continue a declaration made by the us upon its ratification of the  geneva conventions includes a reservation that pre us domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses which could be confused with its military uses this means that the us did not agree to any interpretation of the  geneva conventions that would overrule johnson  johnsons trademark the american red cross continues to recognize the validity of johnson  johnsons trademark in august  johnson  johnson filed a lawsuit against the american red cross arc demanding that the charity halt the use of the

the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third and that a  review of us studies came up with similar results for genital but not general talcum powder use jj were not convinced that the results were

domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses
