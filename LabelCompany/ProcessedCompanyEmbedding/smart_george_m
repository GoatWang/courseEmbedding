marketing plan  example goals for a marketing plan a smart marketing approach can be used as the blueprint for creating efficient and marketing campaigns smart is an acronym that uses specific measurable achievable realistic and timed objectives to outline a successful marketing approach by examining examples of each aspect of the smart marketing objectives you can better understand how to incorporate them in your marketing plan specific using specific marketing objectives means focusing on one goal per plan to maximize efficiency businesses often want to achieve several marketing objectives simultaneously but each objective needs to have its own plan to be effective for example if a sneaker manufacturer wants to introduce a new sneaker line and then expand its product coverage out to a new target demographic then there would be a separate plan for the product release and one for the audience expansion measurable to determine the success of a marketing plan you need to have milestones and goals to measure the measurable aspects of a marketing plan can be number of units sold total sales revenue generated or total profit realized your measurable objectives should be very specific in order to be effective stating that you intend to sell more units than last year is not something that you can use to measure success setting the objective of selling  percent more units than the previous year is something you can use in your marketing plan achievable business growth is a gradual and planned process when you are creating a marketing plan use achievable goals if your historic profit growth from year to year is  percent then setting a marketing goal of  percent growth when there is no data to back up the increased growth is not efficient planning a realistic set of marketing goals motivates staff members to try to achieve the success outlined in the plans setting goals that seem impossible to achieve will lower morale and make it difficult to plan budgets for the coming year realistic the main difference between achievable smart objectives and realistic objectives is resource planning you may have the product momentum to realize a significant jump in unit sales but you may not have the manufacturing or distribution in place to make it happen examples of realistic smart objectives are manufacturing expectations that do not exceed the historical average sales coverage that is not possible with the current sales staff or with projected sales staff growth and sales projections into regions not covered by the current distribution network timed a marketing plan has a scheduled beginning and ending this is to allow an analysis of how the methods worked in attempting to produce projected results create a timeline for each marketing project that includes regular dates for monitoring progress and potentially adjusting the plan for example if you have a marketing plan that is scheduled to last six months then analyze actual results vs projected results each month to see if adjustments need to be made to achieve the overall goal of the plan references  business link write a marketing planmarketing scoop the beginners guide to marketing
