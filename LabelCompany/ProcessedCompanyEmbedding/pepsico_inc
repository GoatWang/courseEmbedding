proactive and progressive of the food companies according to former new york times food industry writer melanie warner in  environmental recordedit rainforests and palm oiledit pepsico palm oil commitments published in may  were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the companys palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry ngos warned however that the commitments did not go far enough and in light of the deforestation crisis in southeast asia have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately genetically modified food ingredientsedit pepsico has contributed  to oppose the passage of california proposition  which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of california food products pepsico believes that geneticallymodified products can play a role in generating positive economic social and environmental contributions to societies around the world particularly in times of food shortages water usage india us ukedit pepsicos usage of water was the subject of controversy in india in the early and mids in part because of the companys alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue in this setting pepsico was perceived by indiabased environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product making it a target for critics at the time as a result in  pepsico launched a countrywide program to achieve a positive water balance in india by  in  pepsicos ceo indra nooyi made a trip to india to address water usage practices in the country prompting prior critic sunita narain director of the centre for science  environment cse to note that pepsico seems to be doing something serious about water now according to the companys  corporate citizenship report as well as media reports at the time the company in  replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in  began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by  percent between the years  and  in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in  saved more than  billion liters of water worldwide compared to its  water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in  noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in  and again in  when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in  however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later in november  the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks in  pepsico was among the  multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in  averaged  percent within the us the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in  pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to  percent by  one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly  percent to  grams with a packaging redesign in  also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first  percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle on march   pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased materials such as switch grass corn husks and pine bark and is  recyclable pepsico plans to use more byproducts of their manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles pepsico has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleumbased pet—which will make the new bottle technology dubbed green bottle feel the same as normal pet pepsico will pilot production in  and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional  billion us gallons  m of petrochemicals in  these critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging which results in the emission of carbon dioxide beginning largely in  pepsico began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy while also placing a focus on emissions reduction in a comparison of  energy usage with recorded usage in  the companys perunit use of energy was reduced by  percent in its beverage plants and  percent in snack plants in  tropicana owned by pepsico was the first brand in the us to determine the carbon footprint of its orange juice product as certified by the carbon trust an outside auditor of carbon emissions also in  pepsico began the test deployment of socalled green vending machines which reduce energy usage by  percent in comparison to average models in use it developed these machines in coordination with greenpeace which described the initiative as transforming the industry in a way that is going to be more climatefriendly to a great degree sales stopped indiaedit after slogans raised to ban pepsi and cocacola products by lakhs of students and youths of tamil nadu in the jallikattu

sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled  billion in  representing  percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in  indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to  billion by  to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes the company aligns with personal responsibility advocates who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes one of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction with the introduction of diet pepsi in  and pepsi max in —both of which are variants of their fullcalorie counterpart pepsi more recent changes have consisted of saturated fat reduction which fritolay reduced by  in lays and ruffles potato chips in the us between  and  also in  pepsicos tropicana brand introduced a new variation of

industrialist from new bern north carolina he coined the name pepsicola in  as the cola developed in popularity he created the pepsicola company in  and registered a patent for his recipe in  the pepsicola company was first incorporated in the state of delaware in  the company went bankrupt in  and on june  of that year the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by charles guth who owned a syrup manufacturing business in baltimore maryland guth was also the president of loft incorporated a leading candy manufacturer and he used the companys labs and chemists to reformulate the syrup he further contracted to stock the soda in lofts large chain of candy shops and restaurants which were known for their soda fountains used loft resources to promote pepsi and moved the soda company to a location close by lofts own facilities in new york city in  the shareholders of loft sued guth for his  stake of pepsicola company in the landmark case guth v loft inc loft won the suit and on may   formally absorbed pepsi into loft which was then rebranded as pepsicola company that same year loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time in the early s pepsicolas product lines expanded with the creation of diet pepsi and purchase of mountain dew in  the pepsicola company merged with fritolay inc to become pepsico inc at the time of its foundation pepsico was incorporated in the state of delaware and headquartered in manhattan new york the companys headquarters were relocated to their present location of purchase new york in  and in  pepsico was reincorporated in the state of north carolina acquisitions and divestmentsedit between the lates and the mids pepsico expanded via acquisition of businesses outside of its core focus of packaged food and beverage brands however it exited these noncore business lines largely in  selling some and spinning off others into a new company named tricon global restaurants which later became known as yum brands inc pepsico also previously owned several other brands that it later sold so it could focus on its primary snack food and beverage lines according to investment analysts reporting on the divestments in  brands formerly owned by pepsico include pizza hut taco bell kfc hot n now east side marios dangelo sandwich shops chevys fresh mex california pizza kitchen stolichnaya via licensed agreement wilson sporting goods and north american van lines the divestments concluding in  were followed by multiple largescale acquisitions as pepsico began to extend its operations beyond soft drinks and snack foods into other lines of foods and beverages pepsico purchased the orange juice company tropicana products in  and merged with quaker oats company in  adding with it the gatorade sports drink line and other quaker oats brands such as chewy granola bars and aunt jemima among others in august  pepsico made a  billion offer to acquire the two largest bottlers of its products in north america pepsi bottling

cocacola company held a higher market share in carbonated soft drink sales within the us in the same year pepsico maintained a higher share of the us refreshment beverage market however reflecting the differences in product lines between the two companies as a result of mergers acquisitions and partnerships pursued by pepsico in the s and s its business has shifted to include a broader product base including foods snacks and beverages the majority of pepsicos revenues no longer come from the production and sale of carbonated soft drinks beverages accounted for less than  percent of its total

food and beverage products made available to its customers employ a reduction in the companys environmental impact and to facilitate diversity and healthy lifestyles within its employee basecitation needed its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations and at times have raised concerns among its critics as the result of a more recent focus on such efforts critics consider pepsico to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies according to former new york times food industry writer melanie warner in  environmental recordedit rainforests and palm oiledit pepsico palm oil commitments published in may  were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the companys palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry ngos warned however that the commitments did not go far enough and in light of the deforestation crisis in southeast asia have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately genetically modified food ingredientsedit pepsico has contributed  to oppose the passage of california proposition  which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of california food products pepsico believes that geneticallymodified products can play a role in generating positive economic social and environmental contributions to societies around the world particularly in times of food shortages water usage india us ukedit pepsicos usage of water was the subject of controversy in india in the early and mids in part because of the companys alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue in this setting pepsico was perceived by indiabased environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product making it a target for critics at the time as a result in  pepsico launched a countrywide program to achieve a positive water balance in india by  in  pepsicos ceo indra nooyi made a trip to india to address water usage practices in the country prompting prior critic sunita narain director of the centre for science  environment cse to note that pepsico seems to be doing something serious about water now according to the companys  corporate citizenship report as well as media reports at the time the company in  replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in  began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by  percent between the years  and  in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in  saved more than  billion liters of water worldwide compared to its  water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in  noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in  and again in  when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in  however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later in november  the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks in  pepsico was among the  multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in  averaged  percent within the us the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in  pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to  percent by  one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly  percent to  grams with a packaging redesign in  also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first  percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle on march   pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased

pepsico will pilot production in  and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional  billion us gallons  m of

sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled  billion in  representing  percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in  indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to  billion by  to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes the company aligns with personal responsibility advocates who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes one of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction with the introduction of diet pepsi in  and pepsi max in —both of which are variants of their fullcalorie counterpart pepsi more recent

further contracted to stock the soda in lofts large chain of candy shops and restaurants which were known for their soda fountains used loft resources to promote pepsi and moved the soda company to a location close by lofts own facilities in new york city in  the shareholders of loft sued guth for his  stake of pepsicola company in the landmark case guth v loft inc loft won the suit and on may   formally absorbed pepsi into loft which was then rebranded as pepsicola company that same year loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time in the early s pepsicolas product lines

needed its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations and at times have raised concerns among its critics as the result of a more recent focus on such efforts critics consider pepsico to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies according to former new york times food industry writer melanie warner in  environmental recordedit rainforests and palm oiledit pepsico palm oil commitments published in may  were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the companys palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry ngos warned however that the commitments did not go far enough and in light of the deforestation crisis in southeast asia have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies

the production of california food products pepsico believes that geneticallymodified products can play a role in generating positive economic social and environmental contributions to societies around the world particularly in times of food shortages water usage india us ukedit pepsicos usage of water was the subject of controversy in india in the early and mids in part because of the companys alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue in this setting pepsico was perceived by indiabased environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product making it a target for critics at the time as a result in  pepsico launched a countrywide program to achieve a positive water balance in india by  in  pepsicos ceo indra nooyi made a trip to india to address water usage practices in the country prompting prior critic sunita narain director of the centre for science  environment cse to note that pepsico seems to be doing something serious about water now according to the companys  corporate citizenship report as well as media reports at the time the company in  replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in  began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by  percent between the years  and  in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in  saved more than  billion liters of water worldwide compared to its  water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in  noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in  and again in  when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in  however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later in november  the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks in  pepsico was among the  multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in  averaged  percent within the us the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in  pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to  percent by  one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly  percent to  grams with a packaging redesign in  also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first  percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle on march   pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased materials such as switch grass corn husks and pine bark and is  recyclable pepsico plans to use more byproducts of their manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles

pepsico will pilot production in  and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional  billion us gallons  m of petrochemicals in  these critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging which results in the emission of carbon dioxide beginning largely in  pepsico began

sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled  billion in  representing  percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in  indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to  billion by  to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes the company aligns with personal responsibility advocates who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes one of the

to be doing something serious about water now according to the companys  corporate citizenship report as well as media reports at the time the company in  replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in  began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by  percent between the years  and  in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in  saved more than  billion liters of water worldwide compared to its  water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in  noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in  and again in  when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in  however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later in november  the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks in  pepsico was among the  multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in  averaged  percent within the us the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in  pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to  percent by  one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly  percent to  grams with a packaging redesign in  also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first  percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle on march   pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased materials such as switch grass corn husks and pine bark and is  recyclable pepsico plans to use more byproducts of their manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles

pepsico will pilot production in  and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional  billion us gallons  m of petrochemicals in  these critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging which results in the emission of carbon dioxide beginning largely in  pepsico began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy while also placing a focus on emissions reduction in a comparison of  energy usage with recorded usage

sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled  billion in  representing  percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in  indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to  billion by  to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos

beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes one of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction with the introduction of diet pepsi in  and pepsi max in —both of which are variants of their fullcalorie counterpart pepsi more recent

industrialist from new bern north carolina he coined the name pepsicola in  as the cola developed in popularity he created the pepsicola company in  and registered a patent for his recipe in  the pepsicola company was first incorporated in the state of delaware in  the company went bankrupt in  and on june  of that year the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by charles guth who owned a syrup manufacturing business in baltimore maryland guth was also the president of loft incorporated a leading candy manufacturer and he used the companys labs and chemists to reformulate the syrup he further contracted to stock the soda in lofts large chain of candy shops and restaurants which were known for their soda fountains used loft resources to promote pepsi and moved the soda company to a location close by lofts own facilities in new york city in  the shareholders of loft sued guth for his  stake of pepsicola company in the landmark case guth v loft inc loft won the suit and on may   formally absorbed pepsi into loft which was then rebranded as pepsicola company that same year loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time in the early s pepsicolas product lines expanded with the creation of diet pepsi and purchase of mountain dew in  the pepsicola company merged with fritolay inc to become pepsico inc at the time of its foundation pepsico was incorporated in

however it exited these noncore business lines largely in  selling some and spinning off others into a new company named tricon global restaurants which later became known as yum brands inc pepsico also previously owned several other brands that it later sold so it could focus on its primary snack food and beverage lines according to investment analysts reporting on the divestments in  brands formerly owned by pepsico include pizza hut taco bell kfc hot n now east side marios dangelo sandwich shops chevys fresh mex california pizza kitchen stolichnaya via licensed agreement wilson sporting

other lines of foods and beverages pepsico purchased the orange juice company tropicana products in  and merged with quaker oats company in  adding with it the gatorade sports drink line and other quaker oats brands such as chewy granola bars and aunt jemima among others in august  pepsico made a  billion offer to acquire the two largest bottlers of its products in north america pepsi bottling

food and beverage products made available to its customers employ a reduction in the companys environmental impact and to facilitate diversity and healthy lifestyles within its employee basecitation needed its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations and at times have raised concerns among its critics as the result of a more recent focus on such efforts critics consider pepsico to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies according to former new york times food industry writer melanie warner in  environmental recordedit rainforests and palm oiledit pepsico palm oil commitments published in may  were welcomed by media as a positive step towards ensuring that the companys palm oil purchases will not contribute to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry ngos warned however that the commitments did not go far enough and in light of the deforestation crisis in southeast asia have called on the company to close the gaps in its policies immediately genetically modified food ingredientsedit pepsico has contributed  to oppose the passage of california proposition  which would mandate the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of california food products pepsico believes that geneticallymodified products can play a role in generating positive economic social and environmental contributions to societies around the world particularly in times of food shortages water usage india us ukedit pepsicos usage of water was the subject of controversy in india in the early and mids in part because of the companys alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial issue in this setting pepsico was perceived by indiabased environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product making it a target for critics at the time as a result in  pepsico launched a countrywide program to achieve a positive water balance in india by  in  pepsicos ceo indra nooyi made a trip to india to address water usage practices in the country prompting prior critic sunita narain director of the centre for science  environment cse to note that pepsico seems to be doing something serious about water now according to the companys  corporate citizenship report as well as media reports at the time the company in  replenished nearly six billion liters of water within india exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by pepsicos india manufacturing facilities water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where pepsico operates in the us water shortages in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the companys production facilities which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought—such as atlanta georgia in response the company formed partnerships with nonprofit organizations such as the earth institute and waterorg and in  began cleaning new gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water among other water conservation practices in the united kingdom also in response to regional drought conditions pepsico snacks brand walkers reduced water usage at its largest potato chip facility by  percent between the years  and  in doing so the factory used machinery that captured water naturally contained in potatoes and used it to offset the need for outside water as a result of water reduction practices and efficiency improvements pepsico in  saved more than  billion liters of water worldwide compared to its  water usage environmental advocacy organizations including the natural resources defense council and individual critics such as rocky anderson mayor of salt lake city utah voiced concerns in  noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as aquafina the company maintained its positioning of bottled water as healthy and convenient while also beginning to partially offset environmental impacts of such products through alternate means including packaging weight reduction pesticide regulation indiaedit pepsicos india operations were met with substantial resistance in  and again in  when an environmental organization in new delhi made the claim that based on its research it believed that the levels of pesticides in pepsico along with those from rival the cocacola company exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the bureau of indian standards pepsico denied the allegations and indias health ministry has also dismissed the allegations—both questioning the accuracy of the data compiled by the cse as it was tested by its own internal laboratories without being verified by outside peer review the ensuing dispute prompted a shortlived ban on the sale of pepsico and the cocacola company soft drinks within indias southwestern state of kerala in  however this ban was reversed by the kerala high court one month later in november  the supreme court of india invalidated a criminal complaint filed against pepsico india by the kerala government on the basis that the beverages did meet local standards at the time of the allegations the court ruling stated that the percentage of pesticides found in the tested beverages was within the tolerance limits subsequently prescribed in respect of such product since at the time of testing there was no provision governing pesticide adulteration in cold drinks in  pepsico was among the  multinational companies that displayed the most impressive corporate social responsibility credentials in emerging markets as determined by the us department of state pepsicos india unit received recognition on the basis of its water conservation and safety practices and corresponding results packaging and recyclingedit environmental advocates have raised concern over the environmental impacts surrounding the disposal of pepsicos bottled beverage products in particular as bottle recycling rates for the companys products in  averaged  percent within the us the company has employed efforts to minimize these environmental impacts via packaging developments combined with recycling initiatives in  pepsico announced a goal to create partnerships that prompt an increase in the beverage container recycling rate in the us to  percent by  one strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called dream machines in supermarkets convenience stores and gas stations with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles the use of resin to manufacture its plastic bottles has resulted in reduced packaging weight which in turn reduces the volume of fossil fuels required to transport certain pepsico products the weight of aquafina bottles was reduced nearly  percent to  grams with a packaging redesign in  also in that year pepsico brand naked juice began production and distribution of the first  percent postconsumer recycled plastic bottle on march   pepsico unveiled the worlds first plantbased pet bottle the bottle is made from plantbased

pepsico will pilot production in  and upon successful completion of the pilot intends moving to fullscale commercialization energy usage and carbon footprintedit pepsico along with other manufacturers in its industry has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging which consumed an additional  billion us gallons  m of

sales of such healthieroriented pepsico brands totaled  billion in  representing  percent of the companys total revenue in that year this movement into a broader healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates though commentators in this field have also suggested that pepsico market its healthier items as aggressively as lesshealthy core products in response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation pepsico in  indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business forecasting that sales of fruit vegetable whole grain and fiberbased products will amount to  billion by  to meet this intended target the company has said that it plans to acquire additional healthoriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells ingredient changes in pepsiedit public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the ingredient makeup of pepsicos core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as obesity and diabetes the company aligns with personal responsibility advocates who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content moving away from transfats and producing products in caloriespecific serving sizes to discourage overconsumption among other changes one of the
