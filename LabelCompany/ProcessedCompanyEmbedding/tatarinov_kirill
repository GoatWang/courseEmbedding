corporate vice president aspires to take microsoft to the top of the fragmented businessmanagement software market for small and midsize organizations the head of microsoft business solutions is out to fashion acquisitions and partnerships into the leading force in management software share story by seattle times staff even with somewhere north of  billion in annual sales microsoft business solutions is dwarfed by the enormous office business that it shares space with in the company’s quarterly reports but kirill tatarinov the group’s leader since july  said mbs brings more to the broader microsoft than revenue from its dynamicsbranded systems which manage a company’s customer relationships suppliers inventory and other business basics it provides a “proof point to business decision makers” using the whole set of microsoft server technologies tatarinov said the dynamics products “take advantage of all the innovation that’s happening” on windows server visual studio office and other major products microsoft sells to businesses the softwareindustry veteran a russian immigrant who pursues ski racing in his spare time is unequivocal about his goal for mbs which competes in a fragmented market selling business applications to small and midsize organizations most read storieswoman  lost in olympic national park with dog built shelter ate antsstarbucks closes

we didn’t have aspirations to be no ” he said in an interview ahead of a major sales conference in new orleans this week success would make good on two of the biggest acquisitions in microsoft’s history and challenge major competitors in the businesssoftware space including oracle and sap as well as the more focused enterprise resource planning erp players lawson infor and sage group the broad erp category includes software that coordinates suppliers tracks inventory handles billing and other basic financial management microsoft is also in the customer relationship management or crm software business which is sometimes categorized as a segment of erp microsoft business solutions is atypical within the software giant in that it is spread geographically among three locations a result of its formation through acquisition there’s great plains in fargo nd acquired for  billion in  and navision a danish company purchased in  for  billion the third location is microsoft’s new advanta office commons three leased buildings in bellevue’s eastgate area better integrating the products and the teams with each other and within the broader company was a substantial challenge facing tatarinov when he took the job he also had to step out of the shadow cast by doug burgum founder of great plains leader of the navision acquisition and a major presence in the evolution of microsoft business solutions until he left the company in june  after burgum’s departure satya nadella got the top job at mbs in fall  but was abruptly moved to lead microsoft’s internet search business seven months later the leadership turnover was unsettling for many of the partner companies that act as middlemen between microsoft and the companies that use the dynamics software providing sales and service “it left kind of a big hole in the dynamics world as far as uncertainty” said andy vabulas chief executive of interactive business information systems a top microsoft partner in norcross ga “suddenly kirill tatarinov gets in there and nobody knows him” early fascination tatarinov  grew up in moscow the son of a software architect working on major airdefense projects for the former soviet union he remembers being fascinated by the diagrams his father would draw and asking him lots of questions he received a master’s in systems engineering from moscow university of transport engineering but later left the soviet union in  as it was on the verge of collapse “i had two little children and really needed to make sure that i put them in a safe environment where they can grow and flourish” tatarinov said after a stay in israel tatarinov moved to australia where he cofounded patrol software which made systemsmonitoring software he sold that company to enterprise software maker bmc and moved to the united states in  eight years later after rising to chief technology officer at houstonbased bmc software tatarinov joined microsoft he moved from the systemsmanagement business — which makes software to help it departments operate and monitor their technology — to head microsoft business solutions in summer  vabulas who met tatarinov early into the executive’s tenure at mbs appreciated his candor and willingness to listen “i’ve never had a relationship that candid at that level in microsoft and he’s done that with lots of partners” vabulas said “he’s not a political guy at all” yet some of his accomplishments particularly uniting the various dynamics teams and partner companies required diplomacy if not outright politicking portfolio of systems microsoft sells four erp systems each the descendant of one of the companies that through acquisitions eventually came together to form the dynamics business navision and great plains had each made an acquisition before being scooped up by microsoft the systems have similar user interfaces and have come a long way toward looking like a unified product line since the acquisitions early this decade and each one is designed for a broad market — professional services say or manufacturing — but there is still some overlap and until recently the groups responsible for each one weren’t always on the same page “when he took over the team they were very divided” said nigel montgomery an analyst for amr research tatarinov said he addressed this by clearly articulating a strategy of winning small and midsize business customers putting a stable leadership team in place and making sure that the people developing the various erp products could articulate why one is different from another and where each one fits in the broader portfolio “for some people it was easy for some people it was more or less of a culture change” tatarinov said competition worries on the partner front the challenge was — and remains — coordinating the efforts of companies worried as much about competition from other microsoft partners as from sap according to a recent amr survey the global recession which contributed to a  percent decline in mbs customer billings in the past quarter is making the situation more delicate “right now obviously partners are very nervous about their own environments and don’t want to see encroachment from other people” montgomery said tatarinov said microsoft is doing more work to coordinate partners now than ever before the best partners are those that support the full dynamics lineup and offer the best systems of their own end customers he said vabulas the partner from norcross ga lauds tatarinov for going forward with a zeropercent financing plan proposed by partners last year to help them win business during the downturn “it’s a good icebreaker it’s a good way to move deals along” he said “it has worked” benjamin j romano  or bromanoseattletimescom

kirill tatarinov convergence  kirill tatarinov convergence  march   kirill tatarinov thank you satya thank you so very much thank you applause well good morning everybody i’m so delighted to join in and welcome you to convergence  this is my eighth convergence and i know that many of you make this event your annual business conference welcome back for those who are joining us for the first time i hope you like what you see and i hope you come back this year the word “convergence” has even a deeper meaning this is about convergence of powerful industry forces that satya talked about this is about the convergence of business and technology where the two truly become inseparable and of course for all of us here at this event this is about convergence of ideas sharing learning from each other growing and getting better at what we do satya shared an incredibly powerful vision of the future future of transformation of business future of systems of intelligence what i’m going to do in the next  minutes is to share with you how that vision applies to all of us applies to people in business people in organizations because fundamentally it is people who drive business success it is people who create it is people who invent it’s people who imagine at microsoft we deliberately take a unique peoplecentric approach we studied deeply what people do in business we design and build our services our solutions and our gotomarket approach based on those individual roles and no matter your role technology plays a very key role in making you better in transforming you in helping you move into the future in a way we want to think of our approach as humanizing the enterprise helping the enterprise be incredibly peoplecentric in its approaches and helping people connect and work much better together business process truly serves as connective tissue in every organization uniting people helping people work together towards achieving a singular goal making people execute towards that goal with precision knowledge and with deep insight wellwritten business process well it’s like poetry there is a reason i shared with satya that russian poetry writeup wellorchestrated business process is like a melody and at microsoft working closely with our partners we’re committed to helping you implement robust smart predictable and yet dynamic and flexible business processes we bake business processes in our solutions and you will see many examples throughout this event on how those business processes enable you to do amazing things how do business processes help you get more insight and how does business process help you serve your customers in a very unique way fundamentally a customer is at the center of every business the customer is at the center of every organization the customer who previously was viewed as an outsider today is an integral part of every business venture we must treat the customer as if they’re part of our organization that is what is expected customers want to be involved in the act of creation of process or service or technology that will be served to them you need to draw them in the customer can participate in helping you advance your brand if you turn them into brand loyalists they’re truly a persona that you need to connect and work with the most customers have very unique and different expectations today they’re more knowledgeable than ever before about the world of technology and about the multitude of choices that the modern world gives to them and you need to be a step ahead you need to know even more about this environment and you need to gain this insight from both inside and outside of your organization to continue to serve them well customers expect a very personable approach today it is almost like the segments of one is what serves as customers it’s almost like going back to the artisanal times where relationship was incredibly custom and personable and it doesn’t matter whether it’s businesstoconsumer or businesstobusiness or businesstobusinesstoconsumer at the end of the day this is about people this is about people working with people and this is about people helping people do amazing things through delivering great services great technologies and delivering brands to them so with that customer engagement is really the most critical business process of them all ability to make sure that every customer interaction is truly fulfilling and ability to make sure that all of those customer interactions are delivered in the way customers expect at the time when they expect and at microsoft we’re committed to make sure that you have the most amazing customer engagement processes delivered to you through our technology and today we do it with a multitude of tools that work very closely together to help you engage with your customers in this mobilefirst cloudfirst world so let’s take a few minutes and talk about several typical roles in organizations and how those roles in the business engage with customers and how they participate in transforming the business and moving it into the future satya already shared with you how his role is changing and how technology applies to moving the job of ceo into the future gaining more insights moving a company like microsoft forward by utilizing technologies like delve and power bi these are indeed technologies that all of you here can use to go deeper let’s focus on a few other roles let’s look at a few categories of people in business let me start with technology led by cio or chief technology officer today this is perhaps the most critical group of people that help businesses transform and move into the future at microsoft we have obviously worked with people in technology for the longest time and we have longstanding relationships with cios and technologists and we’re proud to serve as trusted advisors to many of you who work in the technology business but today more than ever before reimagining it is an absolute imperative being able to bring in all the technological advances keeping the organization on the leading edge saying yes to devices that people want to bring to work saying yes to requirements from the business embracing the business making sure that people in technology are true participants in driving business process that’s what makes cios and people in technology much more progressive and moving into the future people in technology need to know their business so they can help advance it that is an imperative today and this is where we come in helping you achieve that goal of course the fundamentals of cio and the fundamentals of it professionals never change it is about delivering secure scalable and reliable infrastructure and as we’ve seen in the last  months it’s the next wave of escalation in the sophistication of security attacks so protecting the most precious assets of any organization protecting data and protecting the organization become even more critical today than ever before we’re committed to it professionals more than ever before we’re committed to helping it professionals become heroes again we have a great lineup of technologies to enable you to do that starting with something as familiar as system center and many other tools in the azure and windows server family and to something new that we introduced recently such as dynamics lifecycle services that help those who are involved in deploying business solutions and erp systems make it with ease and make it with high precision the next group of people that i want to talk about is the category of folks who traditionally have been branded “back office” these are the people in finance and human resources and in operations led by chief people officer chief financial officer and chief operating officer more than ever before those folks today need to be involved in connecting with customers and enabling the customercentric culture satya talked about transparency data culture enables this completely new level of transparency where the information and data that’s historically been locked somewhere deep in the cellars of the enterprise can now be available to everybody so every single person in the organization of course assuming they have the privilege and access to do that can access that information and can serve their customer better and can get better insight of course knowing where the data is held and making sure that data is protected is part of that transparency and being compliant with government regulations relative to the data and relative to the data location is also part of that transparency people in the human resource profession play an incredible role in helping you advance the culture of customer centricity in fact i can point back to microsoft where our chief people officer kathleen hogan is helping us advance our culture of customer obsession and i think all of you here can follow the lead working with your hr team in the world of extreme agility — and this is certainly the world we live in today — efficiency being able to allocate and reallocate resources with high speed to ensure that you’re focused on the right requirement of the market is of paramount importance so yet again being able to get insight and being able to run predictive scenarios to see where investment needs to flow today is an imperative for people in operations and in finance people in back office traditionally weren’t thought of as innovators but today we have unique opportunities to innovate what historically was viewed as backwardlooking and that innovation would enable you to create new business models would enable you to create new approaches and would enable you to transform your organizations at microsoft we have over  years of experience in helping you implement and run backoffice processes with our erp solutions family we’ve moved that family into the cloudfirst mobilefirst world and together with our partners we’re ready to serve your needs in reinventing your backoffice processes and move them into the future customer care and customer service this is certainly the front line of customer engagement the front line of empowerment knowledge is the key for customer agents serving their customers better being knowledgeable not only understanding your products and your environment and the service that you’re delivering but more importantly getting complete knowledge and complete view of the customer that’s the job of the technical people empowering the customer agents to be excellent proactive service is what the world demands today in most cases organizations already know about potential issues in their customer environment and they can serve those customers better in a proactive manner if they only have access to information if they only have access to that insight internet of things plays a huge role in enabling this proactive and predictive maintenance this is where things communicate with enterprises and enable them to know what’s going on it’s one example of how rockwell automation is doing it and you will see more throughout this event there’s a huge opportunity for customer care agents and for people who are involved in service to drive more business in fact i would say that successful service call is the no  step to potentially sell more to your existing customers upsell crosssell and unleash open and unlock more opportunities whether it’s online commerce or whether it’s working directly with a sales professional in your company with dynamics crm and parature we at microsoft are uniquely positioned to serve needs of your service agents in fact i was very pleased to read just before i walked on stage that both parature and dynamics crm were recognized as leaders by a quite prestigious magazine and yet again another reason for you to consider this solution if you’re not using them yet the professional marketer the professional marketer is perhaps the one that’s undergone the most deep transformation in the last few years and yet it’s not over and yet every technology advancement helps marketers to do a better job in fact today the job of marketer and the job of technologist is almost inseparable a few basics of course remain the same deep knowledge of product of service creating and writing and telling amazing stories advancing your brand those fundamentals are here but the way those stories can be delivered the way the engagement can happen through multiple channels the information that the marketer can gain from the broad audience of people he or she connects with has changed dramatically and unleashed and unlocked many many potentials through the modern communication and collaboration tools marketers are also enabling every person in their organization to be able to advance their brand and move it forward essentially enable every person in their organization to tell the story to deliver the story to deliver amazing brand advancement is what marketers can do at the end of the day this is all about delivering visible and measuring outcomes and delivering impact and also being able to measure this impact so people know exactly what impact and what return marketing generates and with that the requirements to be able to orchestrate and manage resource allocation amongst different marketing activities is of paramount importance at microsoft with dynamics crm and microsoft dynamics marketing being excellent at marketing resource management we’re uniquely positioned to serve the needs of the marketer of the future and help the marketer transform the business and move it to the next level in this event you will have a chance to hear from our own chief marketing officer chris capossela and he’s going to share with you how microsoft is transforming the marketing profession inside our organization and how can you learn from that experience and gain some of our insight the sales professional they say if you’re in business you’re in sales and that’s indeed true this is the broadest population of people every one of us are involved in the act of selling one way or another technology unlocks an enormous amount of opportunities for people and sales and it seems that there is an absolute abundance of opportunity there is no shortage of leads there is no shortage of things to pursue so focus becomes the most important priority for people in sales focusing on the most important things knowing whom to engage with how to engage them which channels to use that is truly important being able to optimize outcomes and being able to follow that outcome with precision enable you to accelerate your pipeline and drive it to impactful delivery and at the end of the day help grow the scope and size of the opportunity so you can deliver great results and drive the business forward with solutions for sales productivity microsoft is uniquely positioned to solve the needs of the sales people this is perhaps one of the most pivotal one of the most important areas that we’re pursuing with microsoft customer engagement portfolio of products and most importantly with microsoft dynamics crm so i would like to welcome on stage julia white and she will show you a day in the life of a sales person a sales person who is very progressive a sales person who is driving their organization to the future julia welcome applause julia white thanks kirill now kirill talked about the importance of sales productivity now i want to show you an example of how this comes to life and what sales productivity means using the microsoft cloud across dynamics crm online office  skype for business and the awesome new surface hub that will be here soon so in this case i’m a busy sales person and i’m trying to get some deals done and i start my day here in crm online and i’m using the spring release with all the new capabilities in it as well and this is where i manage all of my information i have everything i need right at a fingertip and down here i have all of my leads now as a busy sales person i have more leads than i can focus on i want to know what’s the most important lead i should spend my time on right now well crm now actually gives me a score and tells me which lead is most important and they’re ranked here so if i go i see this d printer upgrade that right now is my most important lead based on the score so i’m going to go ahead and select that and find out why well i’m excited to announce that dynamics has partnered with insidesalescom a leading sales acceleration technology company that now uses predictive intelligence to actually tell me which lead is most hot what i should work on right now and with this predictive intelligence i get two scores this neural score which uses public information to let me know if this company is ready — the likelihood to buy right now and the contactability tells me their likelihood to engage based on their engagement with us in past moments and when i see this chart that both of those scores are high i know this is the time to focus on this lead specifically so if it’s hot i’m going to go work on it so i’m going to go into my develop stage here and as i do so you can see that crm offers integration with skype so i can just contact my customer right here if i wanted to but now with the spring release i also have onenote integration so i can have my team notes all my shared meeting notes if i click in here to my onenote notebook i see there was a meeting — applause yeah applause that’s awesome laughter i can see the people who we’re meeting i can see the notes we’re taking so even though i wasn’t there i don’t have to miss a thing and i see in this meeting in particular we talked about how the customer wanted some accessories with their d printer so i want to make sure that i include that backup cooling fan and extruder in the proposal so let me go back to crm and i’m ready to go into that proposal phase now that i know what they want so i’m going to go to that next phase here into proposal and here are my product line items and i have that d printer going there but also now i have suggestions and if i open that it’s actually bringing up all related products to the d printer so i don’t have to remember what all the accessories are crm provides that for me i can go ahead and just pick all those suggested items and go ahead and add it to the product list item for my proposal so now thanks to crm i knew which lead to focus on with that predictive intelligence i had all of the notes from my team so i knew exactly what to do and with the suggested items i know that i have all the right items to move into that proposal phase so now i know it’s hot so i’m going to go ahead and work on that proposal well it turns out a couple weeks ago i was meeting with a colleague eric he’s another sales guy with me and he had this awesome d printer proposal and i haven’t really worked on this product very much and so i don’t have an existing proposal so i want to build on that work that he’s already done rather than start over so i don’t know exactly which meeting i met with eric or what that was called but i can go to delve and i can find that information so here in delve i can go ahead and just search right here on eric and what it brings up is all the information that eric has shared with me that’s also relevant to the work i’m doing so it finds that discovers it for me and there in fact is that d printing proposal so i just found it that simply right within delve i don’t have to create my own proposal i can just work from his and be that much more efficient so i grab that proposal down of course i’m going to save it to my onedrive account where i can do editing which is great but it’s not just about my input and my feedback i actually want to make sure my team gets that as well so i’m going to do the oldfashioned thing which is use email to communicate because we love to try and use email to collaborate but i’m showing you here for the very first time publicly outlook  yes and i’m excited to announce today that technical preview of office  for it pros and developers to get early access to the bits to start testing internally now this build right here doesn’t have all the new enduser features yet so i’ll show you one of my favorites so i’m going to send that email to my team to collaborate i got it sent to eric and ben here i’m going to go ahead and attach that file and you see when i hit “attach file” it actually brings up my most recently used documents from across office so i don’t have to go search for it and browse for it it’s right there there’s that d proposal and when i go to attach it it’s giving me new options i can just send a link from my onedrive account or i can go ahead and do the attachment the old way if i want i’m going to make the right choice and i’m going to send that link and when i hit send it looks like an attachment feels like an attachment and when i send it it actually sends them access to that file all the permissions are handled so i don’t have to actually send a physical attachment and deal with versioning we’re all working in a modern collaborative way using the cloud all working on one document applause all right so now let’s go out to onedrive i want to actually work on that proposal with my coworkers so i’m going to go ahead and open it here from onedrive and i want to go ahead and edit as well while we’re out here so we can all work on it and true for all of the office applications i can do realtime collaboration so we can all be editing the document together so it’s both a conversation and an authoring process together so i’m going to go down here and use one of my favorite capabilities of office you see eric’s now in editing there i get a notice and you can see there he is editing i can see pixel by pixel but i want to put in a table and sometimes i forget in all the various capabilities of office where tables are so i no longer have to know i can just tell office what i want to do and it does it for me using this new tell me capability i just say that i want to insert a table and you see — i spelled it wrong but it almost got it i want to insert a table and it takes me right to that actual command it doesn’t take me to help and how to it actually does it for me i do it right there from the tell me capability all right so i added in what i want i see eric’s doing his edits as well so i think they’re going to work on the proposal which is great but i want to just let them know that i’m going to head off and see trek but before i do i want to send this proposal so i can get going so to do that i’m actually going to open up this brandnew skype for business experience to send them an instant message about that so announcing today also the public preview of skype for business last november we announced a new name for lync skype for business and today it’s now publicly available for everyone to try i’m thrilled to be among the first to show you this new experience it’s gorgeous familiar it’s inspired by skype and enables faster adoptions thanks to the millions of people already using skype today and i can use it to reach anyone across im i can text i can call i can video here i just want to let them know to kind of send the proposal proposal to trek and then of course who doesn’t love these awesome new emoticons hello dancing man got to love that so let them know that also it has all the same richness you’ve come to expect in business capabilities of lync but it’s also now connected with skype we’ve brought together the skype for business and skype network so now all the skype for business users can connect with skype from a contacts perspective and communicate with im voice video so imagine a sales person connecting with any customer a doctor connecting with a patient an employer interviewing someone via skype there are so many possibilities with this new experience fantastic all right so ben wanted to send the proposal off to trek when they’re all done with that so i’m going to go ahead and get over to trek and show them the presentation about the d printer but on the way there i want to get prepared for my meeting so i’m going to show you a new concept app that helps me prep for my sales meeting while i’m en route to the customer and this is just giving you a glimpse of what’s possible when you bring together dynamics azure machine learning office  and bing into this experience and i can get a view of customer insight as well as what’s going on related to that customer so if i go into my meeting here and i can go to that d printer upgrade meeting there’s a link into that concept app that will bring me right into this information so it’s pulling from all different sources right here i see the location i even get traffic information i can go down and see who is attending the meeting i see people from trek as well as from my company and i see here david peterson from trek and i see that little question mark that means that he and i aren’t directly connected in a social network but if i tap on there it’ll show us all of our related connections so i can find someone to connect with him through i can also go to the account area you see this is now pulling information from my dynamics systems i see information about trek i see the opportunities we’re working on them with what they’ve purchased in the past and if i go down i even get all of my communication history from office  the emails the documents that we’re working on together and then going over to news i can see public information about what’s going on with trek and if there’s any kind of interesting notifications i can get those as well you see i just get a quick notice that says trek is announcing a new contest so as i’m walking into the meeting i have a full  view of the customer who i’m connected to what our history has been and even breaking news information then i’m prepared to have a really excellent sales meeting so for the presentation with trek i’m actually going to use my ipad using the beautiful office for ipad experience so here i have powerpoint up on my ipad you see it’s that familiar office experience the ribbon and the commands exactly where you’d expect them but great with touch so i have a really natural experience on this device well let’s go ahead and do the presentation here go into presentation mode and it automatically projects up and i get a nice speaker notes i have my notes i have a timer everything right here at my fingertips to have a really fantastic highimpact presentation and i can swipe through and you see all those rich animations that you’d expect from office but i also have some nice enhancements for this app specifically where i can kind of touch and hold maybe i’ll need a laser pointer and highlight what i’m talking about or if i want to go ahead and add some ink i can annotate here and maybe talk about how these parts come together so some nice enhancements to make it a really impactful presentation using this device all right well my presentation went awesome trek is ready to move forward and ready to purchase so i’m going to head back into the office to talk to the team but on my way back i want to go ahead and update the deal status so i’m going to go back to my phone here where i can do that so right from my dynamics app here i can do that so we’ve done the work to integrate cortana with crm so i can actually just use cortana my digital assistant to do this for me let’s do that now crm open opportunity called trek d printer upgrade cortana opening opportunity called trek d printer upgrade julia white so that simply using natural voice interaction i just ask cortana and she opens that for me cheers applause as you see i have the richness of my crm experience right here in my mobile app and i can go ahead and say i’m ready to close this deal i’ve made that next step closed the presentation ready to move forward so that simple so you see with both dynamics crm as well as office  i have a great rich mobile experience native apps across windows of course ios and android so i can be productive on all of my devices wherever i’m at as a busy sales person all right now i’m back in the office and i’m meeting with my team here and i’m going to use the surface hub for this this is a stunning inch ultrahighdef k touchsensor screen the biggest one ever made it’s a fantastic allinone device highdef cameras built in speakers mikes cpu bluetooth it’s got everything literally all i need is a power cord and i’m ready to go and this is really designed from the ground up for collaboration so it’s in the room collaboration but also across the world and of course that means great skype integration so now literally i walk up and it has my meeting right here i just tap to join that meeting and with that native skype integration drops me right into that meeting experience and when it does though it brings me to a white board again a very natural thing to do in a meeting experience and i have my pen here so for the meeting today i want to go over our pipeline information specifically make sure we want to track that but i also want to — i just got back from trek so i want to go over the customer feedback too but because it’s not a physical keyboard i can do things — sorry physical white board — i can do things that i can’t otherwise like while that customer information is top of mind i actually want to bring that up and i want to talk about that first and you know what trek had some really specific information about both the deck that i showed them as well as the pitch too so that simply i can move things around now everyone on the video — hey guys how’s it going everyone on the video can also see the white board just like they’re in the room with me there’s not that difficulty because they’re not in the room it’s a very natural experience all right but it’s not just about white boarding of course it’s about sharing information so the trek team had feedback about that deck so i’m going to go ahead and connect with ben here the surface pro he has on stage to show that presentation so i can talk about the feedback that trek has so i’ll go ahead and swipe and you’ll see when i touch it actually happens on the surface too it’s not just a display it’s actually a twoway experience we call that “touchback” so i can slide ben can swipe but it’s also about inking of course so if ben wants to mark up the presentation and make some suggestions it shows up on my side and then i can do the same so maybe i think you know trek says they kind of like that — they want to maybe animate it and show how it fits right there and again you see how the ink actually goes back to the surface as well so it’s a really rich twoway experience and the same goes for the people on the videos they could be engaging in that same way so even though we’re in the room and across the world we have that rich experience all right so that is the feedback from trek so let’s go ahead and switch over to look at our pipeline so we’re going to go ahead and open our power bi dashboard and see all of our sales information at a single glance you see everything here on this device in a touch experience for me right now i want to look at this gross revenue in the us and get a sense of what’s happening there so i’ll tap in and go to that space now i see i have gross revenue and i have gross margins here but i really wish i had that combined view well it turns out i can do that right here as well so if i select edit and i just tap on that and literally i’m just going to drag this up and lay it right on top here and power bi does this incredible work of actually combining those two charts and giving me a new view that looks at both pretty awesome applause and if i want to enhance it and see other things it’s been simple it’s just using standard pivot table experiences that all of us can do so maybe i want to add my weekly estimated pipeline i can do that and instantly get a new visualization and you see with this new view i can see wow i can see how d printers are but i really feel that i want to focus on those inch lcd tvs as well all that great visualization helps me understand what’s happening across the business all right and then at the end of this all i have to do with this device is go and hit “end session” and it clears everything off of the hub and so there’s no information remaining the next team or meeting can walk up and begin using the device everything is taken care of and everything is on onenote from my white board so i can just go straight to my onenote notebook or i can email it so everything is captured too so great great meeting experience thanks applause so i showed you just one example of a mobile sales person being productive across the microsoft cloud using dynamics crm office  skype for business and of course the surface hub this really is productivity in a mobilefirst cloudfirst world kirill tatarinov thank you so much julia what an amazing

video pandora kirill tatarinov applause ladies and gentlemen let’s welcome phillip kennedy who is head of it for the americas at pandora jewelry welcome phillip good morning phillip kennedy good morning applause kirill tatarinov you know i didn’t recognize you without a beard phillip kennedy yeah same person i was actually — kirill tatarinov you’re the guy in the video actually phillip kennedy that was actually a thanksgiving day bet with my two younger brothers and i won kirill tatarinov all right well very good congratulations look amazing story of pandora you guys are doing some terrific terrific things the business model is quite exciting you’re based in copenhagen denmark you manufacture in thailand you serve in  countries and the approach you take is really unique and different from everyone else in that industry phillip kennedy it is for us i mean we started out as a manufacturer largely selling through our retail partners and we’re just recently getting into the retail business a little bit more so we are shifting the way we focus and the way we manage our business starting to think more like a retailer kirill tatarinov so technology plays an important role and people who touch those sellers i mean it’s multistage approach multistage business process how do you do that phillip kennedy very tricky laughter but technology is important for us two of the key development platforms that we use one of the first ones is azure so we built a bb portal from the ground up in azure to support our franchise partners give them a place to place their orders we share documents with them item information marketing materials things like that and we also have a selfserve reporting portal that’s been a big success for us that solution is running  instances supporting about  countries and we’re looking to get  percent of our wholesale business through that site by the end of the quarter kirill tatarinov that’s great all right and i see you holding a device phillip kennedy yes this is the other solution that’s key for us development platform our partner hitachi helped us develop this this is the crm mobile client it’s free you can download it from the app store and this is a day in the life of our field representatives our sales reps and our visual merchandisers use this to collect data from the stores and provide us metrics so we can monitor scorecards and then correlate that with sales so you can see your daily activity store visits business plans we write a business plan for every one of our retailers every year and help them manage through that view your active accounts and also view sales actuals to budget we’ll take a quick look at one of our store visits here so this is what the field team does when they actually go into a store they track metrics like outdoor signage do they have a window claim does it reflect the current campaign we do instore branding we can see if they ran a training or not how many people they trained and this is a very intelligent touchscreen experience we’ve issued them surface pro  devices kirill tatarinov that’s fantastic phillip kennedy it’s great kirill tatarinov well it’s a great app i’m sure they’re all empowered they have the ability to collect data in real time gain insights make better and communicate back with headquarters so you guys can make decisions well i really appreciate the partnership and phillip in the spirit of partnership my team gave me this pandora bracelet as we were coming here laughter but unfortunately there are only four charms for men that are currently made phillip kennedy yes kirill tatarinov can you guys do a little more work for us as we’ve been doing for you that will be fantastic phillip kennedy we will all right kirill tatarinov thanks so much phillip kennedy thank you applause kirill tatarinov so pandora has been an amazing user of technology and advancing their business through azure through dynamics crm and dynamics ax running in the back end but all integrated all united all working together as one and that is a powerful example of this uniting business process in a very progressive forwardlooking organization my next guest is accuweather you already had a chance to look at accuweather applications in satya’s speech this morning but let’s look a little more into what accuweather is doing let’s roll the video please video accuweather kirill tatarinov applause what a powerful story ladies and gentlemen allow me to welcome from accuweather dr joel meyers founder president and ceo joel meyers thank you kirill tatarinov and casey mcgeever who is the chief commercial officer joel meyers thank you kirill tatarinov welcome applause gentlemen before we start on behalf of all of us thank you for providing amazing weather here in atlanta joel meyers you’re welcome we’ll take credit kirill tatarinov absolutely joel you founded accuweather over  years ago joel meyers yes seems like just yesterday kirill tatarinov i’m sure it does can you tell us a little bit of insight how it started and the journey joel meyers sure well i grew up in philadelphia and was fascinated with snow when i was three or four years old and by the time i was seven i knew i wanted to be a meteorologist and when i was  i got the idea of starting a company to combine my burning desire to be a weather forecaster with my entrepreneurial spirit and i had the chance to start accuweather as a graduate student at penn state a long time ago kirill tatarinov wow fascinating what a story and obviously when you started there was no technology whatsoever and now the transformation — you saw every step of the way mainframe clientserver and now mobile joel meyers that’s the excitement we’re constantly innovating adapting and finding new applications and continuing to reinvent ourselves kirill tatarinov well that’s fantastic that’s awesome casey i’m sure you see amazing stories from your customers as you’re in touch with them every day we had a bit of a glimpse on what csx is doing in the previous demonstration but what i understand there is more to the csx story casey mcgeever yes there is i’d be glad to tell you that one of our rail clients had a fascinating experience they had two trains heading towards greensburg kansas from opposite directions at  miles an hour we determined that there was going to be a tornado in the area we asked them to stop the trains they did stop them the tornado shot right between the two trains exactly where we said it would be the conductors of the trains actually saw the tornado backlit by lightning as it passed between them no trains were derailed no one was injured on the train it was a huge success story because the tornado was exactly where we told them it would be and we have another example applause kirill tatarinov yeah what an amazing story casey mcgeever thank you for those of you who are concert goers in chicago in soldier field last year during the summer pearl jam was giving a concert and we warned them during the concert of a sudden lightning storm that was going to sweep across soldier field it did indeed sweep across soldier field but first they moved everyone to safety the musicians and the concert goers lightning actually struck the platform where eddie vedder had been standing just a few minutes earlier but no one was injured and again that’s because of the extreme accuracy we have kirill tatarinov that’s incredible that is truly saving lives with technology applause thank you for sharing what a powerful story what a powerful story casey mcgeever i would just say one of the things about that is our false alarm rate is only about  percent whereas the public warnings are about  percent false alarms and so companies take this information and they monetize it they make money by being in the right place at the right time and not being in the wrong place at the wrong time joel meyers making better decisions casey mcgeever making better decisions yes joel kirill tatarinov that’s incredible making better decisions through data and through data culture casey mcgeever and that’s all coming out of the microsoft cloud it’s all driven by azure kirill tatarinov that’s excellent well thank you joel what’s next for accuweather there’s been an amazing transformation thank you for an amazing partnership i understand you’re a deep user of our crm solution having switched from another tool what’s next joel meyers well we’re constantly reinventing ourselves a lot of innovation you saw the portal earlier that’s going to be launched soon we serve  radio stations television stations and newspapers constantly innovating for them  of the fortune  companies and just in the last year we’ve come out with minutecast where we forecast minute by minute so people and companies can make better decisions a day forecast we’re constantly extending the period where we can provide accurate forecasts and a lot of creative products that allow people and businesses to make better decisions so that they get more out of their life their planning and more profit for companies kirill tatarinov fantastic well this is tremendous tremendous story tremendous example and tremendous journey of transformation for over  years with technology thank you so much for your partnership thank you for being with us here and thank you for sharing with us your terrific terrific examples of using technology and data thank you joel thank you casey applause our next customer is from wash laundry and this is the industry that is very traditional this is the approach and the company that you would think involves some very traditional ways of servicing washing machines around condominiums universities and army bases but this is also the company that is completely revolutionizing their approach through technology they’re worldclass in customer service and they use it by taking advantage of everything — essentially everything that microsoft has to offer them let’s take a look at the video video wash laundry kirill tatarinov applause ladies and gentlemen allow me to welcome john buccola who is chief information officer for wash laundry john buccola how are you doing kirill applause kirill tatarinov good how are you good to see you what an amazing powerful story of transformation how do you guys do that john buccola well you know first i think the only thing between this audience and a bio break is you me and that washing machine kirill tatarinov oh yeah i see we have another guest laughter i guess for the first time ever we have a washing machine joining us at the convergence conference so let’s take a look what is so special about this washing machine john john buccola well i’ll show you wash was founded in  and we used to think of ourselves as an old battleship that went out to sea and never came home everything worked all the gauges all of the “ayeaye captain” but it was inefficient and we went out on a journey to transform our business to become not just a laundry services provider but a provider of technology and customer service and so we think about how we touch our customers we install equipment we service that equipment and we collect from that equipment and then disperse that payment back to our customers so a lot of transactions but the service transaction is one that happens all the time you know we do over a million truck rolls a year and we’ve just made it stone simple for our residents and our customers to open service calls what the resident has to do — and we make this again very easy for them they open the app so in this case i’m going to use a windows phone we have this available on windows and all the other mobile platforms as well but the user just scans the bar code on the front of the machine the mobile app does a data exchange with microsoft azure kirill tatarinov that’s awesome john buccola brings down the information from dynamics so we use microsoft’s gp crm and azure office  platforms once that service call is opened the resident will go onto another machine that’s working in the building but that service call goes into our system of intelligence it goes into our command center platform where we can see our calls and you can see the maps you can show at a glance a service manager has everything that he or she needs to deliver superior customer service to our customers kirill tatarinov that’s excellent john buccola collecting tons and tons of data so we have a mountain of data from service from our revenue cycle processes and from our installation as well so all of this information lives inside microsoft’s platforms but we then surface it through power bi and through machine learning as well kirill tatarinov what a powerful example of amazing customer service that you’re delivering john buccola it is you know we were a threestate company just a few years ago and we’ve now grown to be the no  laundry services provider in canada and the no  provider in the united states with superior customer service and bestinclass margins applause thank you quite a transformation for us kirill tatarinov i can imagine all through the use of technology john buccola absolutely kirill tatarinov all right is there something else you want to show us john buccola well what’s next for us is we are going beyond the laundry room and going into other verticals and other geographic areas as well so we’re expanding from being just a laundry services provider to being a multivertical provider to the multihousing segment kirill tatarinov of course you can take this technology and apply it elsewhere and go horizontal john buccola that’s right there are so many unexpected insights we get from our data microsoft’s technology allows us to see that and we’re going to be presenting that in the next session kirill tatarinov that’s excellent i see the app there john buccola yes we have the command center application there’s also a number of screens that a dispatcher or a service manager can see you can see here these are actually technicians so they can see at a tech level there’s kind of a gantt chart there that shows tech by tech the productivity of that tech how long they’ve been driving whether or not they have coverage and then all the ticket flow as well so all these tickets are open sort of from smartphones from our users and then they land on the technician’s smartphone on the other side all automatically kirill tatarinov that is awesome john buccola really exciting kirill tatarinov what a fantastic story and as john mentioned next session with james phillips john will be back sharing more on the wash story it’s an incredible example of the use of technology john buccola thanks so much kirill kirill tatarinov thank you so very much applause so today you saw amazing powerful examples of how technology helps businesses transform you saw how it’s applied to people in business roles you saw how customer engagement plays a critical role as the most important business process you saw how people unite through the power of business process embedded with technology you saw people who are becoming forwardlooking organizations forwardlooking enterprises that use technology all of these companies all of those incredible organizations are here for you to learn from and to share and this is essentially what convergence is all about i want to make sure that you take full advantage of the learning and sharing opportunity in the next four days it is an incredible event it is an incredible opportunity and there is a lot going on here for you

rocket the head of microsoft business solutions is out to fashion acquisitions and partnerships into the leading force in management software prev  of  next john lok  the seattle times kirill tatarinov a ski racer and a corporate vice president aspires to take microsoft to the top of the fragmented businessmanagement software market for small and midsize organizations related brier dudley  microsoft stock brings back that old feeling kirill tatarinovcorporate vice president microsoft business solutions age  on the slopes tatarinov has loved skiing since he was a boy schussing down the hills outside of moscow his new office in the advanta office commons in bellevues eastgate area is  minutes from the bottom of the alpental ski area tatarinov a topflight ski instructor coaches a developmentally disabled boy through outdoors for all he also got back into racing himself this year unicef tatarinov who left moscow as the soviet union was collapsing to find a better environment for his children has been involved with the us fund for unicef for nearly a decade hes now helping organize an advisory group for the united nations childrens fund in seattle which he called one of the few major metropolitan areas around the world that doesnt have an advisoryboard presence even with somewhere north of  billion in annual sales microsoft business solutions is dwarfed by the enormous office business that it shares space with in the companys quarterly reports but kirill tatarinov the groups leader since july  said mbs brings more to the broader microsoft than revenue from its dynamicsbranded systems which manage a companys customer relationships suppliers inventory and other business basics it provides a proof point to business decision makers using the whole set of microsoft server technologies tatarinov said the dynamics products take advantage of all the innovation thats happening on windows server visual studio office and other major products microsoft sells to businesses the softwareindustry veteran a russian immigrant who pursues ski racing in his spare time is unequivocal about his goal for mbs which competes in a fragmented market selling business applications to small and midsize organizations we wouldnt be in this business if we didnt have aspirations to be no  he said in an interview ahead of a major sales conference in new orleans this week success would make good on two of the biggest acquisitions in microsofts history and challenge major competitors in the businesssoftware space including oracle and sap as well as the more focused enterprise resource planning erp players lawson infor and sage group the broad erp category includes software that coordinates suppliers tracks inventory handles billing and other basic financial management microsoft is also in the customer relationship management or crm software business which is sometimes categorized as a segment of erp microsoft business solutions is atypical within the software giant in that it is spread geographically among three locations a result of its formation through acquisition theres great plains in fargo nd acquired for  billion in  and navision a danish company purchased in  for  billion the third location is microsofts new advanta office commons three leased buildings in bellevues eastgate area better integrating the products and the teams with each other and within the broader company was a substantial challenge facing tatarinov when he took the job he also had to step out of the shadow cast by doug burgum founder of great plains leader of the navision acquisition and a major presence in the evolution of microsoft business solutions until he left the company in june  after burgums departure satya nadella got the top job at mbs in fall  but was abruptly moved to lead microsofts internet search business seven months later the leadership turnover was unsettling for many of the partner companies that act as middlemen between microsoft and the companies that use the dynamics software providing sales and service it left kind of a big hole in the dynamics world as far as uncertainty said andy vabulas chief executive of interactive business information systems a top microsoft partner in norcross ga suddenly kirill tatarinov gets in there and nobody knows him early fascination tatarinov  grew up in moscow the son of a software architect working on major airdefense projects for the former soviet union he remembers being fascinated by the diagrams his father would draw and asking him lots of questions he received a masters in systems engineering from moscow university of transport engineering but later left the soviet union in  as it was on the verge of collapse i had two little children and really needed to make sure that i put them in a safe environment where they can grow and flourish tatarinov said after a stay in israel tatarinov moved to australia where he cofounded patrol software which made systemsmonitoring software he sold that company to enterprise software maker bmc and moved to the united states in  eight years later after rising to chief technology officer at houstonbased bmc software tatarinov joined microsoft he moved from the systemsmanagement business — which makes software to help it departments operate and monitor their technology — to head microsoft business solutions in summer  vabulas who met tatarinov early into the executives tenure at mbs appreciated his candor and willingness to listen ive never had a relationship that candid at that level in microsoft and hes done that with lots of partners vabulas said hes not a political guy at all yet some of his accomplishments particularly uniting the various dynamics teams and partner companies required diplomacy if not outright politicking portfolio of systems microsoft sells four erp systems each the descendant of one of the companies that through acquisitions eventually came together to form the dynamics business navision and great plains had each made an acquisition before being scooped up by microsoft the systems have similar user interfaces and have come a long way toward looking like a unified product line since the acquisitions early this decade and each one is designed for a broad market — professional services say or manufacturing — but there is still some overlap and until recently the groups responsible for each one werent always on the same page when he took over the team they were very divided said nigel montgomery an analyst for amr research tatarinov said he addressed this by clearly articulating a strategy of winning small and midsize business customers putting a stable leadership team in place and making sure that the people developing the various erp products could articulate why one is different from another and where each one fits in the broader portfolio for some people it was easy for some people it was more or less of a culture change tatarinov said competition worries on the partner front the challenge was — and remains — coordinating the efforts of companies worried as much about competition from other microsoft partners as from sap according to a recent amr survey the global recession which contributed to a  percent decline in mbs customer billings in the past quarter is making the situation more delicate right now obviously partners are very nervous about their own environments and dont want to see encroachment from other people montgomery said tatarinov said microsoft is doing more work to coordinate partners now than ever before the best partners are those that support the full dynamics lineup and offer the best systems of their own end customers he said vabulas the partner from norcross ga lauds tatarinov for going forward with a zeropercent financing plan proposed by partners last year to help them win business during the downturn its a good icebreaker its a good way to move deals along he said it has worked benjamin j romano
