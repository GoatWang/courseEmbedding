events company news events the ​technology  ​our lineage of innovation  entrepreneurship starts with the wizard of menlo park himself thomas a edison born out of a decadelong effort at general electrics global research center menlo micro is bringing to the market a series of technology innovations that have enabled us to reinvent one of the most essential and fundamental building blocks required for nearly every electronic system imaginablethe switchswitches are ubiquitous and perform various functions in electronic systems  some switch ac or dc signals and others switch radio frequency rf signals  some are mechanical switches that open and close a circuit with physical contacts and others are solidstate switches that use a semiconductorbased device to perform that function  all switches are designed for specific application requirements and all come with tradeoffswhats different about a menlo micro switch  its all in the materialsdriven by the extreme operating conditions required by general electrics industrial businesses the ge global research team was led to look at the micromechanical switch from an entirely different perspective  that different approach led to a deep understanding of failure modes and in turn the development of a unique set of patented metal alloys and processing techniques that enable reliable operation without sacrificing performancewith the core technology development completed and qualified for production in ge systems the menlo micro team is bringing highperformance switch products to multiple end markets with a goal of revolutionizing the way electronic systems are designed some of the key attributes of the menlo micro switch technology includesize  board space and weight are at a premium in many applications  traditional mechanical switches take up lots of space have limited number of channels and in some cases need to be manually assembled  menlo micro switching elements are smaller than the width of a human hair and are architected to be scalable depending on the power ratings required  all switches are manufactured using automated waferlevel processes and tools  they are so small we can fit hundreds of them in a space smaller than mmspeed  making mechanical structures small also means you can make them move fast  make them real small and you can make them open and close real fast  a typical mechanical switch might operate in a few milliseconds whereas menlo micro switches can operate x faster in only a few microseconds  this can have enormous implications on systems that were previously limited in performance by how fast they could reconfigure or open and close critical circuitspower handling   this is an area where menlo micro completely throws conventional wisdom out the window  when faced with the prospect of handling higher power levels most people think bigger  more mass more metal larger air gaps between conductors  we took a different approach  we make everything smaller and move the electrical contacts closer and closer together  our miniaturized switches and scalable architecture allows us to handle s of volts and s of amps without arcing freidrich paschen would be proudpower efficiency  in an increasing number of systems power is getting more and more expensive  when youre working off a battery every db and every microamp counts  both rf and acdc losses need to be balanced with amplification and in some cases extra power supplies  this is where the menlo micro technology really shines  we can scale our switches to have ultralow losses from  ohm down to a few milliohms  and not only that but our electrostaticdriven actuator means that a single switch only needs a few pa to function  thats  amps for those who are countingreliability  when you are developing products to meet the needs of businesses that serve markets like healthcare aviation and other missioncritical industrial applications reliability is not an afterthought its the primary design criteria  in the end thats why we are here  our mechanical switching device has lifetimes more than x longer than traditional mechanical switches not millions of cycles but s of billions of cycles without degrading performance  even more important than the performance thats been demonstrated to date is the deep understanding in material science reliability and failure analysis that enables us to model and predict failures so we can push the technology even further  we have lots of performance enhancements planned in the very near futurethese are just some of the features that have been demonstrated so farand the fun part is that were just getting started as we continue to build up the menlo micro team and engage with dozens and dozens of innovative customers

comment no ratings saveslogin to rate tweet lake wales fla — ge�s global research center has spunoff a microelectromechanical system mems startup called menlo microsystems inc irvine calif funded by general electric ge ventures paladin capital group and partners corning a supplier and microsemi corp a distributor to adjacent markets its only product category — mem digital switches — can be used in aerospace automated test equipment ate next generation g mobile handsets  basestations industrial internet of things iots battery management homeautomation electric vehicles and medical instrumentation applications spawned by what it claims is the industrys first reliable mems digital switch menlo microsystems claims it is already a success with over  units in ge systems that have been fieldtested before the spinoff however the road to success in what would seem a simple problem — converting a mechanical switch or relay into an electronic version — is littered with the remains of startups whose poor reliability eventually forced the companies out of the market ges global research center invented its microelectromechanical system mems electronic switch invented a proprietary alloy blue and green which could be opened and closed in microseconds by an electrostatic gate red with only  ohms resistance when closed source menlo microsystems what makes ge researchs architecture used in menlo microsystems mems digital switches different according to its chief executive officer ceo russ garcia formerly ceo of mems startup wispry and executive vice president of microsemi the answer is focused on the proprietary alloy that ge engineered specifically for digital switches with a lifetime of over a billion switching events our key differentiation is an alloy developed specifically for reliability and already proven in over  mri magnetic resonance imaging machines made by ge garcia told ee times in an exclusive interview originally developed for remote circuit breakers ge adapted the alloy to power hundreds of volts and s of amps at rf radio frequencies with linearity and low insertion loss the ge research center design is scalable by adding more units in series for higher voltages and more in parallel to for higher currents here model mm uses eight in series to handle  volts and six in parallel to carry  amp for a  watt application source menlo microsystems the success of the mri applications gave the ge engineer who invented it chris keimel — now a cofounder and chief technology officer cto — and a ge ventures executive the other cofounder the idea to spinoff menlo microsystems into a separate company ge only makes systems not components so it made sense to spinoff menlo microsystems to serve the many other industrial and consumer applications that ge does not serve garcia told ee times today ge is still manufacturing the digital switches consisting of an electrostaticgate activated cantilever see figure that can handle milliwatts to kilowatts by using multiple units see second figure the higher volumes that menlo microsystems is hoping for has it actively engaging independent foundries to be ready by the end of the decade when g handsets and basestations are in full swing by  menlo microsystems and its partner microsemi plan to tap a total available market tam of almost  billion with its dual strategy of

experience more relevant than another and thats why what google is doing sounds like adding emotions but  pm jeanne pindar thats one of the things i like about my phillips hue lights  they work without an internet connection  i havent had many issues  once in a while a new app will have  pm cbee so this is what its like to be an engineer   rupert from accounting    pm cbee when agent  experienced ps new invention he felt both shaken and stirred  pm dougs apple is doing this because theyre in the process of dropping qualcomm in favor of intel this has one advantage they value far more than price  control with intel theyll  am jmrowca i wonder given all the network security concerns out there that the prognosticators of iot market segment growth are sometimes foolish idiots
