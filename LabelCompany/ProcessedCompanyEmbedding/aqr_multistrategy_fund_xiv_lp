information regarding the velocityshares etns download a prospectus from this site call velocity or  or write to prospectus inquiry velocityshares  old kings highway s darien ct  to request a prospectus you should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision the etns are not suitable for all investors in particular the etns should be purchased only by sophisticated investors who understand the consequences of investing in volatility indices and of seeking inverse or leveraged investment results who understand the path dependence of the underlying indices and the etns who do not intend to hold the etns as a buy and hold investment and who are willing to actively and frequently monitor their investment even intraday the etns are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives over the shortterm and the effect of noncontinuous rebalancing and the resulting pathdependent nature of the exposure of each series of etns means that the etns may deviate significantly from their target exposure and may even have exposure that is inverse to their respective intended target exposures and may therefore fail to achieve their goal particularly over longer periods of time therefore it is likely that you will suffer significant losses even if the level of the cboe volatility index® the “vix index” or the sp  vix shortterm futures index increases over the long term in addition the need to maintain a constant exposure to vix futures creates the potential for positive or negative returns based on the shape of the vix futures curve ie whether the market for vix futures is in contango or in backwardation these changes are separate from outright movements in vix futures as a result the return on a position in vix futures may vary significantly from the percentage changes of the vix index itself typically though not in all market conditions this “roll cost” significantly decreases the return for investors who are long vix futures as a result of this “roll cost” and other factors that may cause the value of your etns to decrease including the effects of daily and quarterly rebalancing and the combined negative effect of the “daily investor fee” and the “futures spread fee” each as described in the applicable prospectus supplement there is a significant possibility that the amount payable on the etns at maturity or upon call early redemption or acceleration will be less than the amount of your initial investment in the etns and that you will lose part or all of your initial investment if you hold the etns for a long period of time ubs does not expect that any investor will hold the etns from inception to maturity the etns do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity and do not pay any interest during their term although we intend to list the etns on nyse arca a trading market for your etns may not develop we are not required to maintain any listing of the etns on nyse arca or any other exchange prior to maturity you may subject to certain restrictions described in the prospectus offer the applicable minimum number of your etns to the issuer for redemption on a redemption date as defined in the prospectus you must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of etns typically ’ or ’ depending on the product as set forth in the pricing supplement or an integral multiple in excess thereof at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your etns on any early redemption date in addition the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the stated principal amount of any etn that is redeemed at the investor’s option at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the etns any payment on the securities is subject to the ability of ubs ag to satisfy its obligations as they become due the risks listed above are not exhaustive investors should review
