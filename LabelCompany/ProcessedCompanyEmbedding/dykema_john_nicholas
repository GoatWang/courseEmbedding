family a loving and devoted husband and father if ever there was one he was filled with unspeakable joy to witness his family tree blossom to include grandchildren and greatgrandchildren life will never be the same without nicholas here but he leaves behind a priceless collection of memories that his loved ones will forever cherish nearly a century has passed since our nation dealt with unsafe
