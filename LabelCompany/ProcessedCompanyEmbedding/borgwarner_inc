marvelschebler warner gear and mechanics universal joint a spin off from borgwarner security corporation borgwarner automotive inc became an independent company in  now known as borgwarner inc the company currently employs  individuals at  locations in  countries and cited combined worldwide sales exceeding  billion in  to date borgwarner has approximately  active patents and patent applications pending or under preparation products manufactured by borgwarner automotive inc that contained asbestos exposure to asbestos as a “causative factor” in the development of mesothelioma has been recognized by several organizations including the occupational safety and health administration osha the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh the world health organization who and the environmental protection agency epa a documented court case identified borgwarner disk brake pads to have contained chrysotile asbestos fibers of which such fibers comprised seven to twentyeight percent of the pad’s weight dependent upon the type of pad in another documented court case borgwarner was identified as the manufacturer of automotive parts including disctype clutches composed of chrysotile asbestos of note was that there were no warnings contained on the product itself or its packaging indicating the potential danger to an individual as a result of asbestos exposure a  study conducted by borgwarner indicated that its clutch manufacturing operations produced levels of airborne asbestos fibers that were in excess of osha standards from the early s to the early s borgwarner supplied the aforementioned clutches to general motors for installation on new vehicles until the company made the decision to dispose of its clutch operation among the products produced by borgwarner automotive inc that may have contained parts with asbestos fibers are borgwarner disk brake pads borgwarner disctype clutches occupations at risk for asbestos exposure brake mechanics auto mechanics and any individuals exposed to an environment where brake repair andor any work with asbestoscontaining friction products including clutches occurred could be at risk for developing an asbestosrelated illness often a mechanic’s job involved grinding the disk brake pads which in turn generated dust that would be inhaled within the confines of the workspace as a result it is alleged that exposure to this dust may result in a range of life threatening illnesses from asbestosis to mesothelioma since the fibers cannot be expelled once inhaled there are no known cures for the resulting illness family members of automotive workers exposed to asbestos may also be at risk of developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated illness as a result of asbestoscontaminated garments entering the home environment and the asbestos fibers being released and inhaled since there is an extended latency period with the development of mesothelioma cancer or other asbestos related illness it can take decades approximately  for an individual to show symptoms from the time of initial exposure learn more about whether you or someone you know may have encountered exposure

variety of industries were exposed to asbestos on the job as a result they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma in this section learn about the history of asbestos use about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure learn which job sites across the united states were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos what is asbestos long considered a miracle material asbestos boasts excellent fire and heat resistant properties this naturallyoccurring mineral now known to be a human carcinogen cancercausing agent has a history that dates back to ancient greece asbestos was used as a building material even as far back as during the roman empire asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles during the industrial revolution asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the united states asbestos was used not only in factories but also in oil refineries chemical plants on railroad cars and in shipyards asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives to line tanks and ovens in refineries and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships from engine rooms to galleys as the twentieth century progressed more uses for asbestos were found it was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles insulated america’s new skyscrapers and was used extensively in the construction industry where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds cements roofing shingles ceiling and floor tiles siding stucco plaster and much more those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestosheavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products by the middle of the twentieth century it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma this asbestosrelated cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium this thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface this scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous yet continued to allow its use over time as stories of sick employees became commonplace the american government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos asbestos exposure in the united states exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites in shipyards aboard navy vessels and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings people working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk in addition teachers students and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products such as ceiling or floor tiles equally at risk are families of these workers as asbestos often was carried home on clothing asbestos exposure across the united states

a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma different types of asbestos exposure military exposure asbestos was used across all branches of the military for many years navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving on ships aircraft carriers destroyers submarines battleships warships etc in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country army veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and while working on military vehicles air force veterans were exposed while working with military aircraft marine corps veterans that spent time at sea aboard navy ships were exposed to asbestos all veterans exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma commercial and industrial exposure many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer the types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries power plants steel mills and chemical plants to name a few they all have “high heat” environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas ie fireproof gloves and aprons today even though the use of asbestos has been banned in the united states many existing industrial and commercial structures may still contain a certain level of asbestos it is important that appropriate safety precautions be taken where necessary to prevent harmful exposure and to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma commercial product exposure doityourself home renovation enthusiasts as well as those who worked in the construction trade may have been exposed to asbestos while working with popular building and construction products many of these products were made with asbestos through the late ’s as the projects they were to be used in required that they be heat and fire resistant they included insulation roofing material siding joint compound ceiling tiles flooring and more unfortunately when any of these products were cut sawed filed or sanded asbestos fibers were released into the air in the majority of cases those working with the products did not use appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information about the health hazards of asbestos for many years today as a result construction workers and doityourselfers are at risk for developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases second hand exposure direct onthejob asbestos exposure did not affect american workers alone their family members were also at risk of developing an asbestosrelated disease as a result of second hand asbestos exposure this type of exposure occurred when workers brought asbestos fibers home on their hair clothing or shoes at the end of the work day those responsible for laundering their work clothes day in and day out were most commonly affected but even small children who spent time with their parent before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at risk of developing an asbestosrelated illness talc exposure talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits due to this some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos while talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure some consumer products namely baby powder and more recently children’s art supplies have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users mostly women to be exposed to asbestos today products using talc are tested for asbestos but that was not always the case because mesothelioma has a long latency period miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestoscontaining talc products unions protect workers from asbestos exposure throughout the united states and across the world hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries from steel workers to plumbers to electricians unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job unions have organized witnesses for court cases have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by megacompanies to compensate asbestos victims compensation for workers exposed to asbestos if you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure you may be entitled to compensation each state has its own deadlines called statutes of limitations which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits dont wait until it is too late to protect your rights

of the systems we offer has been designed using flow benches and dynos to determine the best way to reduce restriction and improve exhaust flow for more power while muffler designs may differ all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends which creates restrictionsound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power that’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel performance and sound are essential but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last all of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel for long lasting durability each includes stylish exhaust tips usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect but if you prefer something different check out our selection of exhaust tips most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter this means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check however if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter these converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow and smoother flowing inlet and outlet jointsif you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power then consider installing headers headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds which usually flow poorly an exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head all tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector the tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flowfeatured videoschip fooses fleah pritchetts challenger hellcatmagnaflow at monster jamthe gridlife experience american muscleborla  ford f projectultimate callout

restriction and improve exhaust flow for more power while muffler designs may differ all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends which creates restrictionsound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power that’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel performance and sound are essential but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last all of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel for long lasting durability each includes stylish exhaust tips usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect but if you prefer something different check out our selection of exhaust tips most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter this means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check however if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter these converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow and smoother flowing inlet and outlet jointsif you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power then consider installing headers headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds which usually flow poorly an exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head all tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector the tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flowfeatured videoschip fooses fleah pritchetts challenger hellcatmagnaflow at

life we offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in onepiece design and twopiece with lightweight aluminum center construction most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling our brake pads come in a myriad of organic ceramic and metallic compounds so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needswe offer both direct replacement calipers and for the ultimate in performance fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc both are made from lightweight aluminum fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical oe floating calipers and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads performance calipers often have larger pistons which can provide more clamping pressure many calipers with  or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taperone of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel stainless steel brake hoses have a teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering this construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions the stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion and provides a much better appearance as well when building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location we offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application including tandem master cylinders compact remote flange mount master cylinders high volume master cylinders and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirsdisc brakes are the gold standard of braking but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drumtodisc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power we offer everything from basic kits with front spindles backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system to complete front and wheel kits that include the above plus calipers rotors bearings hoses master cylinder and booster we also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to wheel disc brakes brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system ordinary dot  fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of dot  fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture which lowers the boiling point the high performance fluid we offer has been tested to °f it has low moisture affinity and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel we also offer dot  silicone fluid for classic and show cars which won’t harm paint if spilled dot  should not be

designs for a detailed discussion here but all can be divided into solid beam axle suspension and independent suspension a solid axle is so called because the wheels on either side of the vehicle are linked by a rigid axle housing and a bump in the road that affects one wheel will also disturb the wheel on the other side solid axles can be live axles that transmit power to the wheels or dead axles that do not as the name implies independent suspensions allow the wheels to move independently of each other and the effect of a bump on the road encountered by one wheel will be isolated to that wheel and will not affect the wheel on the other side of the vehicleshow itemssort byrecommendedprice low to highprice high to lowtop rated productsmonroe® economatic™ complete strut assemblies

engineeringtnttrwtuff countryumi performanceunity automotiveuro partsvaicovemowabcowarriorweaponrwestarwhitelinezone offroadclear allindependent suspensions can be classified according to whether they use struts or shock absorbers a strut is a type of shock absorber that also serves as a supporting suspension member there are modified struts where the springs are separate but the most common type is the macpherson strut which incorporates a shock spring and suspension member in one unit when used at the front of the vehicle the top of the strut is the upper steering pivot shock absorbers are used with control arm suspensions shocks and struts are the most commonly serviced suspension parts because they deteriorate gradually and degrade handling and ride quality it is recommended that they be replaced after  milesleaf springs are the oldest type of springs and generally used to both suspend and locate live axles they are the springs of choice for hauling because they can carry heavy loads and the capacity can be easily increased by adding leaves coil springs are the most common type of spring in use today they are much easier to tune for specific ride andor handling characteristics than leaf springs making them ideal for performance vehicles torsion bars are lengths of spring steel that serve the same purpose as coil springs the advantage of torsion bars is that they can be adjusted to correct vehicle ride height air suspension air springs use compressed air to provide a smooth ride and suspension levelingthe wheels springs and shocks or struts are attached to the vehicle with suspension members called control arms control arms can be called different names according to the suspension system and where they are located on the vehicle including short and long arms radius arms and trailing arms in general they are made of stamped steel or aluminum and articulate by means of bushings and ball joints the control arms themselves are generally very durable and usually only replaced if bent but the bushings and ball joints wear and require replacement to eliminate play that can affect handling and alignment sway bars are a type of torsion bar that

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
