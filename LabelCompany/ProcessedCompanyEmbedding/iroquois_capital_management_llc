iroquois capital management comments on lrad corporation’s earnings  business wire iroquois capital management comments on lrad corporation’s earnings february    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wireiroquois capital management llc today commented on the first fiscal quarter earnings released by lrad corporation nasdaq lrad iroquois capital commented “as the owner of more than  of lrad’s common stock we are very disappointed by lrad’s results the company indicated that quarterly revenues declined by  year over year however we were even more concerned by the large quarterly net loss suffered by lrad that compares to a net profit just one year ago” “while management disclosed some new information that had not been previously revealed on the direction of the business and the composition of its revenues we note that any nominal disclosure closely followed our nomination of five independent nominees to replace the company’s incumbent board this only reinforces our belief that stockholders need representation in the lrad boardroom because we believe that this late stage attempt at transparency is not enough to stem further deterioration in shareholder value” about

capital delivers letter to lrad iroquois capital delivers letter to lrad concerned by the boards failure to effectively manage the companys capital resources including excess cash on the balance sheet and urges that capital be returned to shareholdershighlights the companys failure to capitalize on significant business opportunities as well as concerns regarding recent sales of lrad stock by insiders jun    et from iroquois capital management llc new york june   prnewswire   iroquois capital management llc together with its affiliates iroquois one of the largest unaffiliated shareholders of lrad corporation lrad or the company nasdaq lrad with beneficial ownership of approximately  of the outstanding common stock of the company today announced that it has delivered a letter to the companys board of directors  iroquois also announced it filed a schedule d with the sec earlier today converting from its prior schedule g filing  the full text of the letter follows june   lrad corporation  goldentop road suite a san diego ca  attn members of the board of directors dear board members iroquois capital management llc iroquois capital we or us manages investment funds that together with its affiliates collectively own approximately  of the outstanding common stock including shares underlying certain warrants of lrad corporation lrad or the company making us one of the companys largest unaffiliated shareholders  we are longterm value investors in the company having held shares of lrad since  and have a vested interest in seeing lrad capitalize on all opportunities that may exist to create significant value for shareholders in  we worked closely with lrad to reconstitute and enhance the board of directors the board by replacing two of its thencurrent directors  shortly thereafter in early  we transitioned to a passive schedule g filing at lrad confident that with a reconfigured board the company would be wellpositioned to steer itself in the right direction and create shareholder value in fact the stock proceeded to double in short form following the momentum of these important structural changes  to that end we are especially pleased that general john g coburn one of our recommended directors has proven effective in utilizing his vast experience and network around the globe to expand lrads international footprint particularly in the far east  as a result the companys revenue from international business has been growing substantially recently however with lrads share price down over  yeartodate while the russell microcap growth index is up  we have become increasingly concerned that management and the board may not be acting with a proper sense of urgency in terms of capitalizing on available opportunities to enhance shareholder value specifically our concerns include i the boards failure to effectively manage the companys capital resources including the excess cash on the balance sheet and the lack of share repurchases under the existing buyback plan and ii the companys failure to capitalize on available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications emergency warnings for natural disasters and even the recent shark attacks in north carolina  we also note that insiders including the ceo and cfo have recently engaged in sales of lrad shares immediately upon the exercise of options sending the wrong message to shareholders  in light of these concerns we have converted our schedule g back to a schedule d so that we may be able to more actively engage with the company and shareholders regarding these concerns and the most effective manner for addressing them the board has failed to properly manage the companys capital resources the lrad board is tasked with the responsibility of acting as a steward of shareholder value lrad has excess cash on its balance sheet and we believe should take immediate steps to return this capital to its shareholders through either a substantial increase in its share repurchases under the companys share buyback program or through a significant onetime dividend and a continuing dividend program according to its most recent quarterly report on form q as of march   lrad had over  million in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet which represents nearly twothirds of total assets and over onethird of the companys market capitalization  what is the reason for holding this much of the companys capital in cash  often companies with excess cash reserves take steps to return capital to shareholders  we believe that without some compelling strategy to deploy such cash the best approach for the company is to return it to shareholders  the company already has a share buyback program which it adopted in mid and which expires on december    under the buyback program as amended the company has been authorized to repurchase up to  million of the companys outstanding common shares  according to its public filings the company repurchased no shares in fiscal   shares for  an average of share in fiscal  and an additional  shares for  an average of share in the first half of fiscal   this amounts to share repurchases to date of  or just  of what has been authorized  how can a share buyback program increase shareholder value if it is not being properly utilized  we strongly urge the board to increase the amount of share repurchases under the program or issue a large onetime cash dividend to shareholders  the company has failed to take advantage of readily available business opportunities another concern is the apparent failure by the company to capitalize on potentially significant business opportunities particularly in areas in which the company could realize substantial growth  given the highlypublicized nature of many events for which lrads products are typically utilized there is no excuse in our mind that the company has failed to recognize and capitalize on these growth opportunities  the company launched its omnidirectional product line in  in order to expand into the mass notification market which the company views as substantial in size and growing  lrad has stated that it has added selling resources to focus on this market however it has missed rather obvious potential sales opportunities  for example the company has not built a sales and marketing infrastructure to take advantage of opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications at schools and universities  in light of the recent increase in campus shootings lrad is wellpositioned to provide public and private education institutions with lrads stateoftheart emergency notification products  lrad has also missed sales opportunities with respect to emergency warnings for natural disasters ultimately we believe management needs to do a better job at recognizing potential sources of demand for both its directional and omnidirectional product lines and be prepared to expand into new or underdeveloped markets  the company should develop its sales and marketing capabilities in these areas to be able to more effectively capture these growth opportunities concerns with insider sales of lrad stock in addition to repurchasing a very limited number of what has been authorized under the companys share buyback program we are concerned with the significant selling of lrad shares by certain insiders  according to their insider filings the companys chief executive officer thomas r brown and chief financial officer katherine h mcdermott have been exercising their options and immediately selling large amounts of stock at a substantial profit  mrs mcdermotts sales are particularly disconcerting given her particularly generous compensation package coupled with the fact that she sold each and every share she exercised whats more the prices at which these insiders are selling the shares are often higher than the prices at which the company has offered to repurchase its own shares from lrad shareholders  ms mcdermott on the q  earnings call essentially admitted that the stock price has been too high for the company to engage in share repurchases in the first quarter stating we didnt have any repurchases in the first quarter  based on where our stock price has been its been up pretty high at this point so its still – the program is still active through the end of the calendar year  so depending on the price if the prices are at a reasonable level we will do future repurchases but there werent any in the first quarter  it appears that lrad management and the board will not engage in share repurchases unless it can acquire the shares at a discount however when it comes to their own shares the ceo and cfo are happy to exercise options and sell their shares regardless of the price at a time when the company has excess cash reserves and is conducting its own share buyback program why are these executives selling their stock in such high numbers  these actions are in contrast to what the company is attempting to accomplish through the share buyback program in light of all of the above concerns we remain very excited about the prospects of the company and open to discussing the best ways in which we can constructively work together with the lrad board to take advantage of the available opportunities for the company to create value for the benefit of shareholders best regards

of directors has lost all confidence in the ability of lrads president  ceo thomas r brown to capitalize on lrads industryleading technology and deliver value for shareholders expresses serious concerns with lrads dismal operational and stock performance and recent insider sales by management believes material changes in executive leadership board composition and corporate strategy are required to drive shareholder value creation at lrad jan   am est new york jan   prnewswire  iroquois capital management llc together with funds managed by it iroquois one of the largest shareholders of lrad corporation lrad or the company nasdaq lrad with a beneficial ownership interest in approximately  of lrads outstanding shares inclusive of shares held by members of iroquois d reporting group today announced that it has delivered a letter to the companys board of directors the board the full text of which is included below  iroquois also announced today that it has submitted a letter to the company nominating two candidates with strong relevant backgrounds for election to the board at lrads  annual meeting  iroquois believes that additional shareholder representation on the board alongside general john g coburn richard h osgood and dennis j wend will help ensure that shareholders best interests are appropriately represented and that management is held accountable for its underperformance iroquois highly qualified director nominees include scott l anchin a restructuring professional with more than  years of leadership experience spanning a variety of industries since  mr anchin has worked for alvarez  marsal north america llc a global professional services firm specializing in turnaround and interim management and performance improvement daniel h mccollum a managing director in the investment office of brown university in providence ri a position which he has held since   the full text of iroquois letter to the lrad board follows january   lrad corporation goldentop road suite asan diego ca attn members of the board of directors dear board members iroquois capital management llc iroquois capital we or us together with funds managed by it and members of its schedule d reporting group is one of the largest shareholders of lrad corporation lrad or the company with a combined beneficial ownership interest in approximately  of lrads outstanding shares  we are longterm value investors in the company having held shares of lrad since  and have a vested interest in seeing lrad capitalize on all opportunities that may exist to create significant value for shareholders as you know we worked constructively with lrad back in  to reconstitute and enhance the board of directors the board by replacing two directors with directors that we recommended  we even subsequently converted our schedule d back to a passive schedule g filing as we were hopeful that our involvement had helped to put the company back on the right track towards shareholder value creation  unfortunately it now appears that despite our efforts in  management remains in control and perpetuating what we view as a problematic valuedestructive status quo while demonstrating little accountability for performance  given this lack of progress we now find ourselves back in a similar situation as we faced in  with both the operations and corporate governance of the company in need of significant reform in order to enhance shareholder value we have lost confidence in thomas r brown as lrads president and chief executive officer we have significant concerns and doubts regarding the ability of the companys president and chief executive officer thomas r brown to properly manage the companys capital resources and take advantage of readily available business opportunities  lrads operational performance has been woeful under mr brown  on the  yearend conference call mr brown said he was targeting  revenue growth in   instead the companys total revenues declined approximately  yearoveryear while income from operations was down more than   mr brown also failed to live up to his stated target of delivering much more than  growth in the mass notification market for   rather than hold mr brown accountable for lrads poor performance the board rewarded him with a grant of  options in december  at   we question how this lack of accountability benefits lrad shareholders  it appears that one of the lone bright spots at lrad is the efforts and hard work of one of our recommended directors general john g coburn who has effectively utilized his vast experience and network around the globe to expand lrads international footprint  of note general coburns recent labors led to a modification of lrads existing contract with the united states navy that paved the way for the united states army to purchase the companys acoustic hailing devices we also have serious concerns with the significant selling of lrad shares by certain insiders including mr brown it seems clear to us and we believe to many others as well that the current management team has failed to maximize the potential of lrads directional and omnidirectional product lines and that it is time to hold management accountable for its poor performance  as you know on june   we delivered a letter to the board describing the reasons for converting our passive schedule g filing back to a schedule d  in the june  letter we set forth our serious concerns with the boards failure to effectively manage the companys capital resources including the excess cash on the balance sheet and the lack of share repurchases under the thenexisting buyback plan as well as lrads apparent failure to capitalize on available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications and emergency warnings for natural disasters  the letter also noted our serious concerns that lrad insiders had recently engaged in sales of shares immediately upon exercise of options which sent the wrong message to shareholders regrettably the companys operational performance has not improved since our june  letter  we believe management has continued to poorly oversee the companys capital resources and miss opportunities for growth during a period where the mass notification market is forecast to grow to almost  billion by  the ceo and cfo have unabashedly continued to engage in insider sales in  lrads share price declined over  while the russell microcap growth index only lost   all told we believe the market has lost confidence in managements ability to govern the company  in order to drive the level of change that we believe is required at lrad we have determined to provide shareholders with alternative nominees to elect at lrads  annual meeting of shareholders the  annual meeting  to that end we have delivered to you today a formal notice of our nomination of two highlyqualified director candidates – scott anchin and dan mccollum – for election to the board at the  annual meeting  we believe that additional shareholder representation on the board alongside general coburn richard h osgood and dennis j wend will help ensure that shareholders best interests are appropriately represented we believe management has failed to properly manage the companys capital resources according to its most recent public filings the companys total revenue is down  yearoveryear with income from operations down over  the board may try to divert attention from its poor performance with the announcement of a quarterly dividend of  or a new  million share buyback beginning january    remember the companys buyback programs have often delivered only a fraction of what has been authorized we view lrads declaration of a quarterly dividend and increased buyback program as another attempt to distract shareholders from the companys poor performance no dividend or share buyback can hide the fact that lrads revenues and gross profit for fiscal  decreased substantially despite awardwinning products we believe the company continues to miss opportunities despite exceptional bestinclass products another cause for concern is the companys failure to take advantage of the opportunities within its growing industry in the second quarter of  mr brown stated during the earnings call that the company hoped to meet continued demand in the middle east as ive indicated weve been on a major program in the middle east we are still awaiting to final outcome  we were still chasing this opportunity… were seeing continued demand for lrad … in the middle east unfortunately for the company mr brown lost the mass notification order to a competitor even though mr brown stated in the third quarter earnings call that the company had the best product and price mr browns eventual claim that he was not prepared to conduct business in a manner that would win the contract only begs the question as to why he was so publicly focused on this business in his outreach to shareholders we believe that there is an immense opportunity for lrad to capitalize on the rapidly growing mass notification market and dramatically grow its revenues it is unacceptable that the company has not found a way to take advantage of available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications emergency warnings for natural disasters or countless other domestic and international opportunities  mr brown has shown time and time again his inability to exploit clear opportunities as further evidenced by his latest rehire of the companys previously dismissed public relations spokesman robert putnam as director of marketing with a sixfigure salary  if history serves as any guide we do not have confidence in managements ability to take advantage of lrads industryleading technology to grow the company and maximize shareholder value  continued concerns with insider sales by senior management according to the companys insider filings during fiscal  both mr brown and ms mcdermott have engaged in significant selling of lrad shares based on public filings the ceo and cfo have a welldocumented history of exercising options and selling their shares this stands in stark contrast to the share buyback program in which the sale of insider shares are often higher than the prices at which the company has offered to repurchase its own shares from lrad shareholders clearly the actions by the ceo and cfo are in contrast to what the company is attempting to accomplish through the share buyback program it should not be surprising that a senior management team that only has a nominal stake in the company would act in in a manner that is drastically misaligned with the best interests of the company and its shareholders  we find it outrageous that the company repurchased only a fraction of the shares authorized under its previous buyback program at an average price above  and then issued  options to the ceo and  options to the cfo in december  at  per share the ceos insider filings make clear that that prior to the new issuance mr brown held  options that expired december   at an exercise price of  and that despite the poor performance of the company in fiscal  the ceo was rewarded with more options at a significantly lower exercise price the  dismal  operating  performance  under  mr browns  leadership  the  questionable trading by insiders  and  what we view as a complete  lack  of accountability all  solidify  our  view  that  material  change  in  executive  leadership  board composition and corporate strategy are required at lrad  we are deeply troubled by managements history of poor execution and the boards failure to hold management accountable for its less than admirable track record  we remain openminded about potential solutions and are willing to engage in discussions towards a mutual resolution  however we are steadfast in our belief that increased shareholder representation on the board will be required to ensure improved performance better management accountability and that the best interests of lrad shareholders are represented in the boardroom  best regards joshua
