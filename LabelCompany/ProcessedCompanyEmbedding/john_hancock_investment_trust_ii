include a substantial returnofcapital component an investment in the funds common shares is subject to investment and market risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested an investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund which are generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the overthecounter markets these securities will fluctuate in value and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions fixedincome investments are subject to interestrate risk their value will normally decline as interest rates rise an issuer of securities held by the fund may default have its credit rating downgraded or otherwise perform poorly the fund utilizes a credit facility agreement cfa to increase its assets available for investment shareholders bear the fees associated with this “leverage” and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage it is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the advisor’s fee leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares the risk that the cost of utilizing the cfa will increase with rising interest rates the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage if the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the cfa is terminated the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time incurring tax consequences and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected the fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income capital gains or return of capital the distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time closedend fund shares are not redeemable but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the new york stock exchange

financial services inc a delaware corporation organized in february  investment objective and policies the following information supplements the discussion of the funds investment objective and policies discussed in the prospectus appendix a contains further information describing investment risks the investment objective of the fund is nonfundamental there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective the funds investment objective is capital appreciation under ordinary circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in equity securities of financial services companies for this purpose equity securities include common and preferred stocks and their equivalents including warrants to purchase and securities convertible into such stocks a financial services company is a firm that in its most recent fiscal year either i derived at least  of its revenues or earnings from financial services activities or ii devoted at least  of its assets to such activities financial services companies provide financial services to consumers and businesses and include the following types of us and foreign firms commercial banks thrift institutions and their holding companies financial holding companies consumer and industrial finance companies diversified financial services companies investment banks securities brokerage and investment advisory firms financial technology companies real estaterelated firms leasing firms insurance brokerages and various firms in all segments of the insurance industry such as multiline property and casualty and life insurance companies and insurance holding companies the funds management team invests in financial services companies that are currently undervalued appear to be positioned for a merger or are in a position to benefit from regulatory changes the team believes that the grammleachbliley act which allows banks to acquire investment and insurance firms should reinforce the ongoing pattern of consolidation in the banking and investment sectors since the funds investments will be concentrated in the financial services sector it will be subject to risks in addition to those that apply to the general equity and debt markets events may occur which significantly affect the sector as a whole or a particular segment in which the fund invests accordingly the fund may be subject to greater market volatility than a fund that does not concentrate in a particular economic sector or industry thus it is recommended that an investment in the fund be only a portion of your overall investment portfolio in addition most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which limits their activities and may as with insurance rate regulation affect the ability to earn a profit from a given line of business certain financial services businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures including market share and price competition the removal of regulatory barriers to participation in certain segments of the financial  services sector may also increase competitive pressures on different types of firms for example recent legislation removing traditional barriers between banking and investment banking activities will allow large commercial banks to compete for business that previously was the exclusive domain of securities firms similarly the removal of regional barriers in the banking industry has intensified competition within the industry the availability and cost of funds to financial services firms is crucial to their profitability consequently volatile interest rates and general economic conditions can adversely affect their financial performance financial services companies in foreign countries are subject to similar regulatory and interest rate concerns in particular government regulation in certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates credit availability prices and currency movements in some cases foreign governments have taken steps to nationalize the operations of banks and other financial services companies the adviser believes that the ongoing deregulation of many segments of the financial services sector continues to provide new opportunities for issuers in this sector as deregulation of various financial services businesses continues and new segments of the financial services sector are opened to certain larger financial services firms formerly prohibited from doing business in these segments such as national and money center banks certain established companies in these market segments such as regional banks or securities firms may become attractive acquisition candidates for the larger firm seeking entrance into the segment typically acquisitions accelerate the capital appreciation of the shares of the company to be acquired in addition financial services companies in growth segments such as securities firms during times of stock market expansion or geographically linked to areas experiencing strong economic growth such as certain regional banks are likely to participate in and benefit from such growth through increased demand for their products and services many financial services companies which are actively and aggressively managed and are expanding services as deregulation opens up new opportunities also show potential for capital appreciation particularly in expanding into areas where nonregulatory barriers to entry are low the adviser will seek to invest in those financial services companies that it believes are well positioned to take advantage of the ongoing changes in the financial services sector a financial services company may be well positioned for a number of reasons it may be an attractive acquisition for another company wishing to strengthen its presence in a line of business or a geographic region or to expand into new lines of business or geographic regions or it may be planning a merger to strengthen its position in a line of business or a geographic area the financial services company may be engaged in a line or lines of business experiencing or likely to experience strong economic growth it may be linked to a geographic region experiencing or likely to experience strong economic growth and be actively seeking to participate in such growth or it may be expanding into financial services or geographic regions previously unavailable to it due to an easing of regulatory constraints in order to take advantage of new market opportunities investments in debt securities the fund may invest in debt securities of financial services companies and in equity and debt securities of companies outside of the financial services sector the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in belowinvestment grade debt securities rated at the time of purchase as low as ccc by standard  poors rating group sp or caa by moodys investor services inc moodys the fund may invest in unrated securities which in the opinion of the adviser offer comparable yields and risks to those securities which are rated  to avoid the need to sell equity securities in the funds portfolio to meet redemption requests and to provide flexibility to the fund to take advantage of investment opportunities the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in shortterm investment grade debt securities shortterm debt securities have a maturity of less than one year investment grade securities are rated at the time of purchase bbb or higher by sp or baa or higher by moodys debt securities include corporate obligations such as commercial paper notes bonds or debentures certificates of deposit deposit accounts obligations of the us government its agencies and instrumentalities and repurchase agreements when the adviser believes that financial conditions warrant it may for temporary defensive purposes invest up to  of the funds assets in these securities rated in the four highest categories of sp or moodys ratings as investment criteria in general the ratings of moodys and sp represent the opinions of these agencies as to the quality of the securities which they rate it should be emphasized however that ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality these ratings will be used by the fund as initial criteria for the selection of debt securities among the factors which will be considered are the longterm ability of the issuer to pay principal and interest and general economic trends appendix b contains further information concerning the rating of moodys and sp and their significance subsequent to its purchase by the fund an issue of securities may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below minimum required for purchase by the fund neither of these events will require the sale of the securities by the fund investments in foreign securities the fund may invest directly in the securities of foreign issuers as well as securities in the form of sponsored and unsponsored american depository receipts adrs european depository receipts edrs or other securities convertible into securities of foreign issuers adrs are receipts typically issued by an american bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation edrs are receipts issued in europe which evidence a similar ownership arrangement issuers of unsponsored adrs are not contractually obligated to disclose material information including financial information in the united states generally adrs are designed for use in the united states securities markets and edrs are designed for use in european securities markets foreign currency transactions the funds foreign currency transactions may be conducted on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in the foreign exchange market the fund may also enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to enhance return to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates affecting a particular transaction or portfolio position or as a substitute for the purchase or sale of a currency or assets denominated in that currency forward contracts are agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a specified future date and price set at the time of the contract transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts with respect to specific receivables or payables of the fund accruing in connection with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities quoted or denominated in the same or related foreign currencies portfolio hedging is the use of forward foreign currency contracts to offset portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in the same or related foreign currencies the fund may elect to hedge less than all of its foreign portfolio positions as deemed appropriate by the adviser  if the fund purchases a forward contract or sells a forward contract for nonhedging purposes the fund will segregate cash or liquid securities in a separate account of the fund in an amount equal to the value of the funds total assets committed to the consummation of such forward contract the assets in the segregated account will be valued at market daily and if the value of the securities in the separate account declines additional cash or securities will be placed in the account so that the value of the account will be equal the amount of the funds commitment with respect to such contracts hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the prices of portfolio securities or prevent losses if the prices of such securities decline such transactions also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency rises moreover it may not be possible for the fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates risks of foreign securities investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that are published about issuers in the united states also foreign issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to united states issuers because foreign securities may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the funds net asset value the value of dividends and interest earned gains and losses realized on the sale of securities and any net investment income and gains that the fund distributes to shareholders securities transactions undertaken in some foreign markets may not be settled promptly so that the funds investments on foreign exchanges may be less liquid and subject to the risk of fluctuating currency exchange rates pending settlement foreign securities will be purchased in the best available market whether through overthecounter markets or exchanges located in the countries where principal offices of the issuers are located foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the united states while growing in volume they usually have substantially less volume than the new york stock exchange and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable united states issuers fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on united states exchanges although the fund will endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed issuers than in the united states with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of the fund political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect united states investments in those countries moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in terms of growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position  the dividends in some cases capital gains and interest payable on certain of the funds foreign portfolio securities may be subject to foreign withholding or other foreign taxes thus reducing the net amount of income or gains available for distribution to the funds shareholders repurchase agreements in a repurchase agreement the fund buys a security for a relatively short period usually not more than  days subject to the obligation to sell it back to the issuer at a fixed time and price plus accrued interest the fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with member banks of the federal reserve system and with primary dealers in us government securities the adviser will continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the parties with whom it enters into repurchase agreements the fund has established a procedure providing that the securities serving as collateral for each repurchase agreement must be delivered to the funds custodian either physically or in bookentry form and that the collateral must be marked to market daily to ensure that each repurchase agreement is fully collateralized at all times in the event of bankruptcy or other default by a seller of a repurchase agreement the fund could experience delays in liquidating the underlying securities during the period while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto possible subnormal levels of income decline in value of the underlying securities or lack of access to income during this period as well as the expense of enforcing its rights reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings the fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements which involve the sale of us government securities held in its portfolio to a bank with an agreement that the fund will buy back the securities at a fixed future date at a fixed price plus an agreed amount of interest which may be reflected in the repurchase price reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be borrowings by the fund reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of securities purchased by the fund with proceeds of the transaction may decline below the repurchase price of the securities sold by the fund which it is obligated to repurchase the fund will also continue to be subject to the risk of a decline in the market value of the securities sold under the agreements because it will reacquire those securities upon effecting their repurchase to minimize various risks associated with reverse repurchase agreements the fund will establish and maintain a separate account consisting of liquid securities of any type or maturity in an amount at least equal to the repurchase prices of the securities plus any accrued interest thereon under such agreements the fund will not enter into reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings except from banks as a temporary measure for extraordinary emergency purposes in amounts not to exceed   of the funds total assets including the amount borrowed taken at market value the fund will not use leverage to attempt to increase income the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only with federally insured banks which are approved in advance as being creditworthy by the trustees under procedures established by the trustees the advisers will monitor the creditworthiness of the banks involved restricted securities the fund may purchase securities that are not registered restricted securities under the securities act of   act including commercial paper issued in reliance on section  of the  act and securities offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers under rule a under the  act the fund will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid investments which includes repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days otc options securities that are not readily marketable and restricted securities if the trustees determine based upon a continuing review of the trading markets for specific section   paper or rule a  securities that they are liquid they will not be subject to the  limit on illiquid securities the trustees have adopted guidelines and delegated to the adviser the daily function of determining and monitoring the liquidity of restricted securities the trustees however will retain sufficient oversight and be ultimately responsible for the determinations the trustees will carefully monitor the funds investments in these securities focusing on such important factors among others as valuation liquidity and availability of information this investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in the fund to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities options on securities securities indices and currency the fund may purchase and write sell call and put options on any securities in which it may invest on any securities index based on securities in which it may invest or on any currency in which fund investments may be denominated these options may be listed on national domestic securities exchanges or foreign securities exchanges or traded in the overthecounter market the fund may write covered put and call options and purchase put and call options to enhance total return as a substitute for the purchase or sale of securities or currency or to protect against declines in the value of portfolio securities and against increases in the cost of securities to be acquired writing covered options a call option on securities or currency written by the fund obligates the fund to sell specified securities or currency to the holder of the option at a specified price if the option is exercised at any time before the expiration date a put option on securities or currency written by the fund obligates the fund to purchase specified securities or currency from the option holder at a specified price if the option is exercised at any time before the expiration date options on securities indices are similar to options on securities except that the exercise of securities index options requires cash settlement payments and does not involve the actual purchase or sale of securities in addition securities index options are designed to reflect price fluctuations in a group of securities or segment of the securities market rather than price fluctuations in a single security writing covered call options may deprive the fund of the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the securities or foreign currency assets in its portfolio writing covered put options may deprive the fund of the opportunity to profit from a decrease in the market price of the securities or foreign currency assets to be acquired for its portfolio all call and put options written by the fund are covered a written call option or put option may be covered by i maintaining cash or liquid securities either of which may be quoted or denominated in any currency in a segregated account with a value at least equal to the funds obligation under the option ii entering into an offsetting forward commitment andor iii purchasing an offsetting option or any other option which by virtue of its exercise price or otherwise reduces the funds net exposure on its written option position a written call option on securities is typically covered by maintaining the securities that are subject to the option in a segregated account the fund may cover call options on a securities index by owning securities whose price changes are expected to be similar to those of the underlying index the fund may terminate its obligations under an exchange traded call or put option by purchasing an option identical to the one it has written obligations under overthecounter options may be terminated only by entering into an offsetting transaction with the counterparty to such option such purchases are referred to as closing purchase transactions  purchasing options the fund would normally purchase call options in anticipation of an increase or put options in anticipation of a decrease protective puts in the market value of securities or currencies of the type in which it may invest the fund may also sell call and put options to close out its purchased options the purchase of a call option would entitle the fund in return for the premium paid to purchase specified securities or currency at a specified price during the option period the fund would ordinarily realize a gain on the purchase of a call option if during the option period the value of such securities or currency exceeded the sum of the exercise price the premium paid and transaction costs otherwise the fund would realize either no gain or a loss on the purchase of the call option the purchase of a put option would entitle the fund in exchange for the premium paid to sell specified securities or currency at a specified price during the option period the purchase of protective puts is designed to offset or hedge against a decline in the market value of the funds portfolio securities or the currencies in which they are denominated put options may also be purchased by the fund for the purpose of affirmatively benefiting from a decline in the price of securities or currencies which it does not own the fund would ordinarily realize a gain if during the option period the value of the underlying securities or currency decreased below the exercise price sufficiently to cover the premium and transaction costs otherwise the fund would realize either no gain or a loss on the purchase of the put option gains and losses on the purchase of put options may be offset by countervailing changes in the value of the funds portfolio securities the funds options transactions will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities on which such options are traded these limitations govern the maximum number of options in each class which may be written or purchased by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written or purchased on the same or different exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers thus the number of options which the fund may write or purchase may be affected by options written or purchased by other investment advisory clients of the adviser an exchange board of trade or other trading facility may order the liquidation of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose certain other sanctions risks associated with options transactions there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on a domestic or foreign options exchange will exist for any particular exchangetraded option or at any particular time if the fund is unable to effect a closing purchase transaction with respect to covered options it has written the fund will not be able to sell the underlying securities or currencies or dispose of assets held in a segregated account until the options expire or are exercised similarly if the fund is unable to effect a closing sale transaction with respect to options it has purchased it would have to exercise the options in order to realize any profit and will incur transaction costs upon the purchase or sale of underlying securities or currencies reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or the options  clearing corporation may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist however outstanding options on that exchange that had been issued by the options clearing corporation as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the funds ability to terminate overthecounter options is more limited than with exchangetraded options and may involve the risk that brokerdealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations the adviser will determine the liquidity of each overthecounter option in accordance with guidelines adopted by the trustees the writing and purchase of options is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions the successful use of options depends in part on the advisers ability to predict future price fluctuations and for hedging transactions the degree of correlation between the options and securities or currency markets futures contracts and options on futures contracts to seek to increase total return or hedge against changes in interest rates securities prices or currency exchange rates the fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures contracts and purchase and write call and put options on these futures contracts the fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions with respect to any of these contracts and options the futures contracts may be based on various securities such as us government securities securities indices foreign currencies and any other financial instruments and indices all futures contracts entered into by the fund are traded on us or foreign exchanges or boards of trade that are licensed regulated or approved by the commodity futures trading commission cftc futures contracts a futures contract may generally be described as an agreement between two parties to buy and sell particular financial instruments or currencies for an agreed price during a designated month or to deliver the final cash settlement price in the case of a contract relating to an index or otherwise not calling for physical delivery at the end of trading in the contract positions taken in the futures markets are not normally held to maturity but are instead liquidated through offsetting transactions which may result in a profit or a loss while futures contracts on securities or currency will usually be liquidated in this manner the fund may instead make or take delivery of the underlying securities or currency whenever it appears economically advantageous to do so a clearing corporation associated with the exchange on which futures contracts are traded guarantees that if still open the sale or purchase will be performed on the settlement date hedging and other strategies hedging is an attempt to establish with more certainty than would otherwise be possible the effective price or rate of return on portfolio securities or securities that the fund proposes to acquire or the exchange rate of currencies in which portfolio securities are quoted or denominated when interest rates are rising or securities prices are falling the fund can seek to offset a decline in the value of its current portfolio securities through the sale of futures contracts when interest rates are falling or securities prices are rising the fund through the purchase of futures contracts can attempt to secure better rates or prices than might later be available in the market when it effects anticipated purchases the fund may seek to offset anticipated changes in the value of a currency in which its portfolio securities or securities that it intends to purchase are quoted or denominated by purchasing and selling futures contracts on such currencies  the fund may for example take a short position in the futures market by selling futures contracts in an attempt to hedge against an anticipated rise in interest rates or a decline in market prices or foreign currency rates that would adversely affect the dollar value of the funds portfolio securities such futures contracts may include contracts for the future delivery of securities held by the fund or securities with characteristics similar to those of the funds portfolio securities similarly the fund may sell futures contracts on any currencies in which its portfolio securities are quoted or denominated or in one currency to hedge against fluctuations in the value of securities denominated in a different currency if there is an established historical pattern of correlation between the two currencies if in the opinion of the adviser there is a sufficient degree of correlation between price trends for the funds portfolio securities and futures contracts based on other financial instruments securities indices or other indices the fund may also enter into such futures contracts as part of its hedging strategy although under some circumstances prices of securities in the funds portfolio may be more or less volatile than prices of such futures contracts the adviser will attempt to estimate the extent of this volatility difference based on historical patterns and compensate for any differential by having the fund enter into a greater or lesser number of futures contracts or by attempting to achieve only a partial hedge against price changes affecting the funds portfolio securities when a short hedging position is successful any depreciation in the value of portfolio securities will be substantially offset by appreciation in the value of the futures position on the other hand any unanticipated appreciation in the value of the funds portfolio securities would be substantially offset by a decline in the value of the futures position on other occasions the fund may take a long position by purchasing futures contracts this would be done for example when the fund anticipates the subsequent purchase of particular securities when it has the necessary cash but expects the prices or currency exchange rates then available in the applicable market to be less favorable than prices that are currently available the fund may also purchase futures contracts as a substitute for transactions in securities or foreign currency to alter the investment characteristics of or currency exposure associated with portfolio securities or to gain or increase its exposure to a particular securities market or currency options on futures contracts the fund may purchase and write options on futures for the same purposes as its transactions in futures contracts the purchase of put and call options on futures contracts will give the fund the right but not the obligation for a specified price to sell or to purchase respectively the underlying futures contract at any time during the option period as the purchaser of an option on a futures contract the fund obtains the benefit of the futures position if prices move in a favorable direction but limits its risk of loss in the event of an unfavorable price movement to the loss of the premium and transaction costs the writing of a call option on a futures contract generates a premium which may partially offset a decline in the value of the funds assets by writing a call option the fund becomes obligated in exchange for the premium upon exercise of the option to sell a futures contract if the option is exercised which may have a value higher than the exercise price conversely the writing of a put option on a futures contract generates a premium which may partially offset an increase in the price of securities that the fund intends to purchase however the fund becomes obligated upon exercise of the option to purchase a futures contract if the option is exercised which may have a value lower than the exercise price the loss incurred by the fund in writing options on futures is potentially unlimited and may exceed the amount of the premium received  the holder or writer of an option on a futures contract may terminate its position by selling or purchasing an offsetting option of the same series there is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected the funds ability to establish and close out positions on such options will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid market other considerations the fund will engage in futures and related options transactions either for bona fide hedging purposes or to seek to increase total return as permitted by the cftc to the extent that the fund is using futures and related options for hedging purposes futures contracts will be sold to protect against a decline in the price of securities or the currency in which they are quoted or denominated that the fund owns or futures contracts will be purchased to protect the fund against an increase in the price of securities or the currency in which they are quoted or denominated it intends to purchase the fund will determine that the price fluctuations in the futures contracts and options on futures used for hedging purposes are substantially related to price fluctuations in securities held by the fund or securities or instruments which it expects to purchase as evidence of its hedging intent the fund expects that on  or more of the occasions on which it takes a long futures or option position involving the purchase of futures contracts the fund will have purchased or will be in the process of purchasing equivalent amounts of related securities or assets denominated in the related currency in the cash market at the time when the futures or option position is closed out however in particular cases when it is economically advantageous for the fund to do so a long futures position may be terminated or an option may expire without the corresponding purchase of securities or other assets to the extent that the fund engages in nonhedging transactions in futures contracts and options on futures the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish these nonhedging positions will not exceed  of the net asset value of the funds portfolio after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on any such positions and excluding the amount by which such options were inthemoney at the time of purchase the fund will engage in transactions in futures contracts and related options only to the extent such transactions are consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for maintaining its qualification as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes transactions in futures contracts and options on futures involve brokerage costs require margin deposits and in the case of contracts and options obligating the fund to purchase securities or currencies require the fund to establish a segregated account consisting of cash or liquid securities in an amount equal to the underlying value of such contracts and options while transactions in futures contracts and options on futures may reduce certain risks these transactions themselves entail certain other risks for example unanticipated changes in interest rates securities prices or currency exchange rates may result in a poorer overall performance for the fund than if it had not entered into any futures contracts or options transactions perfect correlation between the funds futures positions and portfolio positions will be impossible to achieve in the event of an imperfect correlation between a futures position and a portfolio position which is intended to be protected the desired protection may not be obtained and the fund may be exposed to risk of loss in addition it is not possible to hedge fully or protect against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in foreign currencies because the value of such securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of independent factors not related to currency fluctuations  some futures contracts or options on futures may become illiquid under adverse market conditions in addition during periods of market volatility a commodity exchange may suspend or limit trading in a futures contract or related option which may make the instrument temporarily illiquid and difficult to price commodity exchanges may also establish daily limits on the amount that the price of a futures contract or related option can vary from the previous days settlement price once the daily limit is reached no trades may be made that day at a price beyond the limit this may prevent the fund from closing out positions and limiting its losses lending securities the fund may lend portfolio securities to brokers dealers and financial institutions if the loan is collateralized by cash or us government securities according to applicable regulatory requirements the fund may reinvest any cash collateral in shortterm securities and money market funds when the fund lends portfolio securities there is a risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities involved in the transaction as a result the fund may incur a loss or in the event of the borrowers bankruptcy the fund may be delayed in or prevented from liquidating the collateral it is a fundamental policy of the fund not to lend portfolio securities having a total value exceeding   of its total assets rights and warrants the fund may purchase warrants and rights which are securities permitting but not obligating their holder to purchase the underlying securities at a predetermined price subject to the funds investment restrictions generally warrants and stock purchase rights do not carry with them the right to receive dividends or exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying securities and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer as a result an investment in warrants and rights may be considered to entail greater investment risk than certain other types of investments in addition the value of warrants and rights does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities and they cease to have value if they are not exercised on or prior to their expiration date investment in warrants and rights increases the potential profit or loss to be realized from the investment of a given amount of the funds assets as compared with investing the same amount in the underlying stock short sales the fund may engage in short sales in order to profit from an anticipated decline in the value of a security the fund may also engage in short sales to attempt to limit its exposure to a possible market decline in the value of its portfolio securities the fund may sell short securities that are not in the funds portfolio but which the adviser believes possess volatility characteristics similar to those being hedged to effect such a transaction the fund must borrow the security sold short to make delivery to the buyer the fund is then obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing it at the market price at the time of replacement until the security is replaced the fund is required to pay to the lender any accrued interest and may be required to pay a premium forward commitment and whenissued securities the fund may purchase securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis whenissued refers to securities whose terms are available and for which a market exists but which have not been issued the fund will engage in whenissued transactions with respect to securities purchased for its portfolio in order to obtain what is considered to be an advantageous price and yield at the time of the transaction for whenissued transactions no payment is made until delivery is due often a month or more after the purchase in a forward commitment transaction the fund contracts to purchase securities for a fixed price at a future date beyond customary settlement time  when the fund engages in forward commitment and whenissued transactions it relies on the seller to consummate the transaction the failure of the issuer or seller to consummate the transaction may result in the funds losing the opportunity to obtain a price and yield considered to be advantageous the purchase of securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis also involves a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date on the date the fund enters into an agreement to purchase securities on a whenissued or forward commitment basis the fund will segregate in a separate account cash or liquid securities of any type or maturity equal in value to the funds commitment these assets will be valued daily at market and additional cash or securities will be segregated in a separate account to the extent that the total value of the assets in the account declines below the amount of the whenissued commitments alternatively the fund may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities that it owns shortterm trading and portfolio turnover shortterm trading means the purchase and subsequent sale of a security after it has been held for a relatively brief period of time the fund may engage in shortterm trading in response to stock market conditions changes in interest rates or other economic trends and developments or to take advantage of yield disparities between various fixed income securities in order to realize capital gains or improve income shortterm trading may have the effect of increasing portfolio turnover rate a high rate of portfolio turnover  or greater involves correspondingly greater brokerage expenses the funds portfolio turnover rate is set forth in the table under the caption financial highlights in the prospectus

for by the loi over a fortyeight  month period these retirement plans include traditional roth and education iras sep sarsep k b including tsas simple ira simple k money purchase pension profit

combinations but not including reinvested dividends must aggregate  or more during the specified period from the date of the loi or from a date within ninety  days prior thereto upon written request to signature services the sales charge applicable to all amounts invested under the loi is computed as if the aggregate amount intended to be invested had been invested immediately if such aggregate amount is not actually invested the difference in the sales charge actually paid and the sales charge payable had the loi not been in effect is due from the investor however for the purchases actually made within the specified period either  or  months the sales charge applicable will not be higher than that which would have applied including accumulations and combinations had the loi been for the amount actually invested the loi authorizes signature services to hold in escrow a sufficient class a shares approximately  of the aggregate to make up any difference in sales charges on the amount intended to be invested and the amount actually invested until such investment is completed within the specified period at which time the escrowed class a shares will be released if the total investment specified in the loi is not completed the class a shares held in escrow may be redeemed and the proceeds used as required to pay such sales charge as may be due by signing the loi the

by an investor to purchase or by the fund to sell any additional class a shares and may be terminated at any time deferred sales charge on class b and class c shares investments in class b shares are purchased at net asset value per share without the imposition of an initial sales charge so that the fund will receive the full amount of the purchase payment contingent deferred sales charge class b and class c shares which are redeemed within six years or one year of purchase respectively will be subject to a cdsc at the rates set forth in the prospectus as a percentage of the dollar amount subject to the cdsc the charge will be assessed on an amount equal to the lesser of the current market value or the original purchase cost of the class b or class c shares being redeemed no cdsc will be imposed on increases in account value above the initial purchase price or on shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions  class b shares are not available to fullservice retirement plans administered by signature services or the life company that had more than  eligible employees at the inception of the fund account the amount of the cdsc if any will vary depending on the number of years from the time of payment for the purchase of class b shares until the time of redemption of such shares solely for purposes of determining this number of years from the time of any payment for the purchases of both class b and class c shares all payments during a month will be aggregated and deemed to have been made on the first day of the month in determining whether a cdsc applies to a redemption the calculation will be determined in a manner that results in the lowest possible rate being charged it will be assumed that your redemption comes first from shares you have held beyond the sixyear cdsc redemption period for class b or one year cdsc redemption period for class c or those you acquired through dividend and capital gain reinvestment and next from the shares you have held the longest during the sixyear period for class b shares for this purpose the amount of any increase in a shares value above its initial purchase price is not subject to a cdsc thus when a share that has appreciated in value is redeemed during the cdsc period a cdsc is assessed only on its initial purchase price when requesting a redemption for a specific dollar amount please indicate if you require the proceeds to equal the dollar amount requested if not indicated only the specified dollar amount will be redeemed from your account and the proceeds will be less any applicable cdsc example you have purchased  class b shares at  per share the second year after your purchase your investments net asset value per share has increased by  to  and you have gained  additional shares through dividend reinvestment if you redeem  shares at this time your cdsc will be calculated as follows oproceeds of  shares redeemed at  per shares  x   ominus appreciation    x  shares  o minus proceeds of  shares not subject to cdsc dividend reinvestment   oamount subject to cdsc  the appreciation is based on all  shares in the account not just the shares being redeemed proceeds from the cdsc are paid to john hancock funds and are used in whole or in part by john hancock funds to defray its expenses related to providing distributionrelated services to the fund in connection with the sale of the class b and class c shares such as the payment of compensation to select selling brokers for selling class b and class c shares the combination of the cdsc and

diversification of its assets the fund will not be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income including net realized capital gains which is distributed to shareholders in accordance with the timing requirements of the code the fund will be subject to a  nondeductible federal excise tax on certain amounts not distributed and not treated as having been distributed on a timely basis in accordance with annual minimum distribution requirements the fund intends under normal circumstances to avoid or minimize liability for such tax by satisfying such distribution requirements

investment company taxable income they will be taxable as ordinary income and if they are paid from the funds net capital gain they will be taxable as capital gains net capital gain is the excess if any of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss and investment company taxable income is all taxable income and capital gains other than net capital gain after reduction by deductible expenses some distributions may be paid in january but may be taxable to shareholders as if they had been received december  of the previous year the tax treatment described above will apply without regard to whether distributions are received in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the fund distributions if any in excess of ep will constitute a return of capital under the code which will first reduce an investors federal tax basis in fund shares and then to the extent such basis is exceeded will generally give rise to capital gains shareholders who have chosen automatic reinvestment of their distributions will have a federal tax basis in each share received pursuant to such a reinvestment equal to the amount of cash they would have received had they elected to receive the distribution in cash dividend by the number of shares received in the reinvestment if the fund invests in stock including an option to acquire stock such as is inherent in a convertible bond of certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gain or hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income passive foreign investment companies the fund could be subject to federal income tax and additional interest charges on excess distributions received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies even if all income or gain actually received by the fund is timely distributed to its shareholders the fund would not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such a tax an election may be available to ameliorate these adverse tax consequences but could require the fund to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash these investments could also result in the treatment of associated capital gains as ordinary income the fund may limit andor manage its holdings in passive foreign investment companies or make an available election to minimize its tax liability or maximize its return from these investments  foreign exchange gains and losses realized by the fund in connection with certain transactions involving foreign currencydenominated debt securities foreign currency forward contracts foreign currencies or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to section  of the code which generally causes such gains and losses to be treated as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders transactions in foreign currencies that are not directly related to the funds investment in stock or securities including speculative currency positions could under future treasury regulations produce income not among the types of qualifying income from which the fund must derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year if the net foreign exchange loss for a year treated as ordinary loss under section  were to exceed the funds investment company taxable income computed without regard to such loss the resulting overall ordinary loss for such year would not be deductible by the fund or its shareholders in future years the fund may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries with respect to its investments in foreign securities tax conventions between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes investors may be entitled to claim us foreign tax credits or deductions with respect to foreign income taxes or certain other foreign taxes qualified foreign taxes paid by the fund subject to certain provisions and limitations contained in the code if the fund so elects if more than  of the value of the funds total assets at the close of any taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations the fund may file an election with the internal revenue service pursuant to which shareholders of the fund will be required to i include in ordinary gross income in addition to taxable dividends and distributions actually received their pro rata shares of qualified foreign taxes paid by the fund even though not actually received by them and ii treat such respective pro rata portions as foreign taxes paid by them if the fund makes this election shareholders may then deduct such pro rata portions of foreign income taxes in computing their taxable income or alternatively use them as foreign tax credits subject to applicable limitations against their us federal income taxes shareholders who do not itemize deductions for federal income tax purposes will not however be able to deduct their pro rata portion of foreign income taxes paid by the fund although such shareholders will be required to include their share of such taxes in gross income shareholders who claim a foreign tax credit for such foreign taxes may be required to treat a portion of dividends received from the fund as a separate category of income for purposes of computing the limitations on the foreign tax credit taxexempt shareholders will ordinarily not benefit from this election each year that the fund files the election described above its shareholders will be notified of the amount of i each shareholders pro rata share of foreign income taxes paid by the fund and ii the portion of fund dividends which represents income from each foreign country if the fund cannot or does not make this election the fund will deduct the foreign taxes it pays in determining the amount it has available for distribution to shareholders and shareholders will not include these foreign taxes in their income nor will they be entitled to any tax deductions or credits with respect to such taxes the amount of the funds net realized capital gains if any in any given year will vary depending upon the advisers current investment strategy and whether the adviser believes it to be in the best interest of the fund to dispose of portfolio securities andor engage in options futures or forward transactions that will generate capital gains at the time of an investors purchase of fund shares a portion of the purchase price is often attributable to realized or unrealized appreciation in the funds portfolio or undistributed taxable income of the fund consequently subsequent distributions from such appreciation or income may be taxable to such investor even if the net asset value of the investors shares is as a result of the distributions reduced below the investors cost for such shares and the distributions in reality represent a return of a portion of the purchase price  upon a redemption or other disposition of shares of the fund including by exercise of the exchange privilege in a transaction that is treated as a sale for tax purposes a shareholder will ordinarily realize a taxable gain or loss depending upon his basis in his shares such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholders hands a sales charge paid in purchasing shares of the fund cannot be taken into account for purposes of determining gain or loss on the redemption or exchange of such shares within  days after their purchase to the extent shares of the fund or another john hancock fund are subsequently acquired without payment of a sales charge pursuant to the reinvestment or exchange privilege this disregarded charge will result in an increase in the shareholders tax basis in the shares subsequently acquired also any loss realized on a redemption or exchange may be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced with other shares of the fund within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the shares are disposed of such as pursuant to automatic dividend reinvestments in such a case the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss any loss realized upon the redemption of shares with a tax holding period of six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions of longterm capital gain with respect to such shares shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding their particular circumstances to determine whether a disposition of fund shares is properly treated as a sale for tax purposes as is assumed in the foregoing discussion although its present intention is to distribute at least annually all net capital gain if any the fund reserves the right to retain and reinvest all or any portion of the excess as computed for federal income tax purposes of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss in any year the fund will not in any event distribute net capital gain realized in any year to the extent that a capital loss is carried forward from prior years against such gain to the extent such excess was retained and not exhausted by the carryforward of prior years capital losses it would be subject to federal income tax in the hands of the fund upon proper designation of this amount by the fund each shareholder would be treated for federal income tax purposes as if the fund had distributed to him on the last day of its taxable year his pro rata share of such excess and he had paid his pro rata share of the taxes paid by the fund and reinvested the remainder in the fund accordingly each shareholder would a include his pro rata share of such excess as capital gain in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the funds taxable year falls b be entitled either to a tax credit on his return for or to a refund of his pro rata share of the taxes paid by the fund and c be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis for his shares in the fund by the difference between his pro rata share of such excess and his pro rata share of such taxes for federal income tax purposes the fund is permitted to carry forward a net realized capital loss in any year to offset its own net capital gains if any during the eight years following the year of the loss to the extent subsequent net capital gains are offset by such losses they would not result in federal income tax liability to the fund as noted above and would not be distributed as such to shareholders the fund has  of capital loss carry forwards available to the extent provided by regulations to offset net capital gains the carry forwards expire as follows october   and october   for purposes of the dividends received deduction available to corporations dividends received by the fund if any from us domestic corporations in respect of the stock of such corporations held by the fund for us federal income tax purposes for at least  days  days in the case of certain preferred stock during a prescribed period extending before and after each such  dividend and distributed and properly designated by the fund may be treated as qualifying dividends the fund would generally have a portion of its distributions treated as qualifying dividends corporate shareholders must meet the holding period requirements stated above with respect to their shares of the fund for each dividend in order to qualify for the deduction and if they have any debt that is deemed under the code directly attributable to such shares may be denied a portion of the dividends received deduction the entire qualifying dividend including the otherwise deductible amount will be included in determining the alternative minimum tax liability if any additionally any corporate shareholder should consult its tax adviser regarding the possibility that its tax basis in its shares may be reduced for federal income tax purposes by reason of extraordinary dividends received with respect to the shares and to the extent such basis would be reduced below zero that current recognition of income would be required the fund is required to accrue income on any debt securities that have more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount or debt securities acquired at a market discount if the fund elects to include market discount in income currently prior to the receipt of the corresponding cash payments the mark to market or constructive sale rules applicable to certain options futures forwards short sales or other transactions may also require the fund to recognize income or gain without a concurrent receipt of cash additionally some countries restrict repatriation which may make it difficult or impossible for the fund to obtain cash corresponding to its earnings or assets in those countries however the fund must distribute to shareholders for each taxable year substantially all of its net income and net capital gains including such income or gain to qualify as a regulated investment company and avoid liability for any federal income or excise tax therefore the fund may have to dispose of its portfolio securities under disadvantageous

extent if any the funds distributions are derived from interest on or in the case of intangible property taxes the value of its assets is attributable to certain us government obligations provided in some states that certain thresholds for holdings of such obligations andor reporting requirements are satisfied the fund will not seek to satisfy any threshold or reporting requirements that may apply

all taxable distributions to shareholders as well as gross proceeds from the redemption or exchange of fund shares except in the case of certain exempt recipients ie corporations and certain other

taxpayer identification number and certain certifications required by the irs or if the irs or a broker notifies the fund that the number furnished by the shareholder is incorrect or that the

imposed by the code on regulated investment companies like the fund may restrict the funds ability to enter into options futures foreign currency positions and foreign currency forward contracts certain options futures and forward foreign currency contracts undertaken by the fund may cause the fund to recognize gains or losses from marking to market even though its positions have not been sold or terminated and affect the character as longterm or shortterm or in the case of foreign currency contracts as ordinary income or loss and timing of some capital gains and losses realized by the fund additionally the fund may be required to recognize gain but not loss if an option is treated as a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position in the funds portfolio also certain of the funds losses on its transactions involving options futures or forward contracts andor offsetting or successor portfolio positions may be deferred rather than being taken into account currently in calculating the funds taxable income or gains certain of these transactions may also cause the fund to dispose of investments sooner than would otherwise have occurred these transactions may therefore affect the amount timing and character of the funds distributions to shareholders the fund will take into account the special tax rules including consideration of available elections applicable to options futures or forward contracts in order to minimize any potential adverse tax consequences the foregoing discussion relates solely to us federal income tax law as applicable to us persons ie us citizens or residents and us domestic corporations partnerships trusts or estates subject to tax under such law the discussion does not address special tax rules applicable to certain types of

other payments from the fund nonus investors should consult their tax advisers regarding such treatment and the application of foreign taxes to an investment in the fund the fund is not subject to

 were  and  respectively as of october   the average annual total returns for class b shares of the fund for the  year period and since commencement of operations on january   were  and  respectively as of october   the cumulative total return for class c shares of the fund since commencement of operations on march   was  total return is computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return over the designated periods that would equate the initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value according to the following formula n  t   ervp   where p  a hypothetical initial investment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  investment made at the beginning of the  year and lifeoffund periods because each class has its own sales charge and fee structure the classes have different performance results in the case of each class this calculation assumes the maximum sales charge is included in the initial investment or the cdsc is applied at the end of the period respectively this calculation assumes that all dividends and distributions are reinvested at net asset value on the reinvestment dates during the period the distribution rate is determined by annualizing the result of dividing the declared dividends of the fund during the period stated by the maximum offering price or net asset value at the end of the period excluding the funds sales charge from the distribution rate produces a high rate in addition to average annual total returns the fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative total returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period cumulative total returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments andor a series of redemptions over any time period total returns may be quoted with or without taking the funds sales charge on class a shares or the cdsc on class b or class c shares into account excluding the funds sales charge on class a shares and the cdsc on class b or class c shares from a total return calculation produces a higher total return figure from time to time in reports and promotional literature the funds total return will be compared to indices of mutual funds such as lipper analytical services incs lipper mutual performance analysis a monthly publication which tracks net assets total return and yield on mutual funds in the united states ibottson and associates cda weisenberger and fc towers are also used for comparison purposes as well as the russell and wilshire indices  performance rankings and ratings reported periodically in and excerpts from national financial publications such as money magazine forbes business week the wall street journal morningstar stangers and barrons etc may also be utilized the funds promotional and sales literature may make reference to the funds beta beta is a reflection of the market related risk of the fund by showing how responsive the fund is to the market the performance of the fund is not fixed or guaranteed performance quotations should not be considered to be representations of performance of the fund for any period in the future the performance of the fund is a function of many factors including its earnings expenses and number of outstanding shares fluctuating market conditions purchases sales and maturities of portfolio securities sales and redemptions of shares of beneficial interest and changes in operating expenses are all examples of items that can increase or decrease the funds performance brokerage allocation decisions concerning the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and the allocation of brokerage commissions are made by the adviser pursuant to recommendations made by an investment committee of the adviser which consists of officers and directors of the adviser and affiliates and trustees who are interested persons of the fund orders for purchases and sales of securities are placed in a manner which in the opinion of the adviser will offer the best price and market for the execution of each such transaction purchases from underwriters of portfolio securities may include a commission or commissions paid by the issuer and transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect a spread debt securities are generally traded on a net basis through dealers acting for their own account as principals and not as brokers no brokerage commissions are payable on these transactions in the us government securities market securities are generally traded on a net basis with dealers acting as principal for their own account without a stated commission although the price of the security usually includes a profit to the dealer on occasion certain money market instruments and agency securities may be purchased directly from the issuer in which case no commissions or premiums are paid in other countries both debt and equity securities are traded on exchanges at fixed commission rates commissions on foreign transactions are generally higher than the negotiated commission rates available in the us there is generally less government supervision and regulation of foreign stock exchanges and brokerdealers than in the us the funds primary policy is to execute all purchases and sales of portfolio instruments at the most favorable prices consistent with best execution considering all of the costs of the transaction including brokerage commissions this policy governs the selection of brokers and dealers and the market in which a transaction is executed consistent with the foregoing primary policy the conduct rules of the national association of securities dealers inc and other policies that the trustees may determine the adviser may consider sales of shares of the fund as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute the funds portfolio transactions to the extent consistent with the foregoing the fund will be governed in the selection of brokers and dealers and the negotiation of brokerage commission rates and dealer spreads by the reliability and quality of services including primarily the availability and value of research information and to a lesser extent statistical assistance furnished to the adviser of the fund and their value and expected contribution to the performance of the fund it is not possible to place a dollar value on information and services to be received from brokers and dealers since it is only supplementary to the research efforts of the adviser the receipt of research information is not expected to reduce significantly the expenses of the adviser the research information and statistical assistance furnished by brokers and dealers may benefit the life  company or other advisory clients of the adviser and conversely brokerage commissions and spreads paid by other advisory clients of the adviser may result in research information and statistical assistance beneficial to the fund the fund will not make commitments to allocate portfolio transactions upon any prescribed basis while the advisers officers will be primarily responsible for the allocation of the funds brokerage business the policies and practices of the adviser in this regard must be consistent with the foregoing and at all times be subject to review by the trustees for the fiscal years ended october    and  the fund paid negotiate brokerage commissions of   and  respectively as permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  the fund may pay to a broker which provides brokerage and research services to the fund an amount of disclosed commission in excess of the commission which another broker would have charged for effecting that transaction this practice is subject to a good faith determination by the trustees that such price is reasonable in light of the services provided and to such policies as the trustees may adopt from time to time during the fiscal years ended october   the fund paid  in commissions to compensate brokers for research services such as industry economic and company reviews and evaluations of securities the advisers indirect parent the life company is the indirect sole shareholder of signator investors inc a brokerdealer until january   john hancock distributors inc signator or affiliated broker pursuant to procedures determined by the trustees and consistent with the above policy of obtaining best net results the fund may execute portfolio transactions with or through the affiliated broker for the fiscal years ended october    and  the fund paid no brokerage commissions to the affiliated broker signator may act as broker for the fund on exchange transactions subject however to the general policy of the fund set forth above and the procedures adopted by the trustees pursuant to the investment company act commissions paid to an affiliated broker must be at least as favorable as those which the trustees believe to be contemporaneously charged by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold a transaction would not be placed with an affiliated broker if the fund would have to pay a commission rate less favorable than the affiliated brokers contemporaneous charges for comparable transactions for its other most favored but unaffiliated customers except for accounts for which the affiliated broker acts as clearing broker for another brokerage firm and any customers of the affiliated broker not comparable to the fund as determined by the majority of the trustees who are not interested persons as defined in the investment company act of the fund the adviser or the affiliated broker because the adviser which is affiliated with the affiliated broker has as an investment adviser to the fund the obligation to provide investment management services which include elements of research and related investment skills such research and related skills will not be used by the affiliated broker as a basis for negotiating commissions at a rate higher than that determined in accordance with the above criteria other investment advisory clients advised by the adviser may also invest in the same securities as the fund when these clients buy or sell the same securities at substantially the same time the adviser may average the transactions as to price and allocate the amount of available investments in a manner which the adviser believes to be equitable to each client including the fund because of this client accounts in a particular style may sometimes not sell or acquire securities as quickly or at the same prices as they might if each were managed and traded individually  for purchases of equity securities when a complete order is not filled a partial allocation will be made to each account pro rata based on the order size for high demand issues for example initial public offerings shares will be allocated pro rata by account size as well as on the basis of account objective account size  a small accounts allocation may be increased to provide it with a meaningful position and the accounts other holdings in addition an accounts allocation may be increased if that accounts portfolio manager was responsible for generating the investment idea or the portfolio manager intends to buy more shares in the secondary market for fixed income accounts generally securities will be allocated when appropriate among accounts based on account size except if the accounts have different objectives or if an account is too small to get a meaningful allocation for new issues when a complete order is not filled a partial allocation will be made to each account pro rata based on the order size however if a partial allocation is too small to be meaningful it may be reallocated based on such factors as account objectives duration benchmarks and credit and sector exposure in some instances this investment procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by the fund or the size of the position obtainable for it on the other hand to the extent permitted by law the adviser may aggregate securities to be sold or purchased for the fund with those to be sold or purchased for other clients managed by it in order to obtain best execution transfer agent services john

primary securities and investment practices you may find the most concise description of the funds risk profile in the prospectus a fund is permitted to utilize  within limits established by the trustees  certain other securities and investment practices that have higher risks and opportunities associated with them to the extent that the fund utilizes these securities or practices its overall performance may be affected either positively or negatively on the following pages are brief definitions of certain associated risks with them with examples of related securities and investment practices included in brackets see the investment objective and policies and investment restrictions sections of this statement of additional information for a description of this funds investment policies the fund follows certain policies that may reduce these risks as with any mutual fund there is no guarantee that the fund will earn income or show a positive return over any period of time  days months or years types of investment risk correlation risk the risk that changes in the value of a hedging instrument will not match those of the asset being hedged hedging is the use of one investment to offset the effects of another investment incomplete correlation can result in unanticipated risks eg short sales financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts credit risk the risk that the issuer of a security or the counterparty to a contract will default or otherwise become unable to honor a financial obligation eg borrowing reverse repurchase agreements repurchase agreements securities lending noninvestmentgrade securities financial futures and options securities and index options currency risk the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect an investment adverse changes in exchange rates may erode or reverse any gains produced by foreign currency denominated investments and may widen any losses eg foreign equities financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts information risk the risk that key information about a security or market is inaccurate or unavailable eg noninvestmentgrade securities foreign equities interest rate risk the risk of market losses attributable to changes in interest rates with fixedrate securities a rise in interest rates typically causes a fall in values while a fall in rates typically causes a rise in values eg noninvestmentgrade securities financial futures and options securities and index options a leverage risk associated with securities or practices such as borrowing that multiply small index or market movements into large changes in value eg borrowing reverse repurchase agreements whenissued securities and forward commitments o hedged when a derivative a security whose value is based on another security or index is used as a hedge against an opposite position that the fund also holds any loss generated by the derivative should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment and vice versa while hedging can reduce or eliminate losses it can also reduce or eliminate gains eg short sales financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts o speculative to the extent that a derivative is not used as a hedge the fund is directly exposed to the risks of that derivative gains or losses from speculative positions in a derivative may be substantially greater than the derivatives original cost eg short sales financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts o liquidity risk the risk that certain securities may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time and the price that the seller would like the seller may have to lower the price sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on fund management or performance eg noninvestmentgrand securities short sales restricted and illiquid securities financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts management risk the risk that a strategy used by a funds management may fail to produce the intended result common to all mutual funds market risk the risk that the market value of a security may move up and down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably these fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it or less than it was worth at an earlier time market risk may affect a single issuer industry sector of the economy or the market as a whole common to all stocks and bonds and the mutual funds that invest in them eg short sales shortterm trading whenissued securities and forward commitments noninvestmentgrade securities foreign equities financial futures and options securities and index options restricted and illiquid securities natural event risk the risk of losses attributable to natural disasters crop failures and similar events eg foreign equities opportunity risk the risk of missing out on an investment opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of it are tied up in less advantageous investments eg short sales whenissued securities and forward commitments financial futures and options securities and index options currency contracts a political risk the risk of losses attributable to government or political actions from changes in tax or trade statutes to governmental collapse and wareg foreign equities valuation risk the risk that a fund has valued certain of its securities at a higher price than it can sell them for eg noninvestmentgrade securities restricted and illiquid securities a appendix b description of bond ratings moodys bond ratings bonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities  bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well bonds which are rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small bonds which are rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest as described by the rating companies themselves standard  poors bond ratings aaa this is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest aa bonds rated aa also qualify as highquality debt obligations capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong and in the majority of instances they differ from aaa issues only in small degree a bonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions b bbb bonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest whereas they normally exhibit protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this category than for bonds in the a category bb debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating b debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating ccc debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ccc rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating cc the rating cc is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating b financial statements the
