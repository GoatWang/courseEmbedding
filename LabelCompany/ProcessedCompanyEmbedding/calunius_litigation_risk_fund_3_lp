society gazette the growing acceptance of litigation funding st october  the current issue of industry magazine ‘litigation funding’ features an article by calunius chairman leslie perrin and calunius head of underwriting christian stuerwald on the growing acceptance of litigation funding by corporate claimants the article describes two cases supported by the calunius fund and the way the corporate minds in each case came to the conclusion that litigation funding was the right thing to do both from a risk management perspective and to allow them to concentrate on core business activities allianz to discontinue litigation funding business – other providers rate the business highly allianz prozessfinanzierung   october  the allianz litigation funding subsidiary in germany today announced that it will discontinue its business activity the group wants to concentrate on its core activity existing litigation funding agreements will be complied with until the cases are concluded but no new cases will be funded because the average lifetime of a funded case is between  and  years this means that the company will still be active in the market for the coming years calunius‘ christian stuerwald who worked for allianz until  comments on the development as follows “the subsidiary has become the victim of its own success in my view after the humble beginnings of  the industry and the company with it grew steadily which led to greater demand for the funding of large commercial claims directed against very large corporate entities due to the fact that allianz is one of the largest insurers in the world numerous conflicts of interests ensued where the group acted as insurer of defendant companies this irresolvable systemic conflict is in my view the best reason why litigation

to “the king” it is with immense pride that calunius is able to announce that the calunius fund is funding litigation by elvis presley enterprises against the successors to rca records now part of the sony group the case alleges that the buy out agreement of february  whereby rca acquired the worldwide rights to the entire elvis presley backcatalogue was a “conspicuously disproportionate” bargain and that the court should step in and impose “equitable remuneration” on the deal particularly in the light of recent changes in german law that have extended the period of copyright protection to  years the case is proceeding in the munich regional court under german copyright law most cases that are funded by the calunius fund are confidential however in these circumstances elvis presley enterprises have agreed that publication was in the best interests of the litigation and we are delighted to have the opportunity to shine some light on the progress of our business as it becomes one

case this report in the lawyer struck us as wellbalanced and perceptive litigation funders poised to prove finances in place the lawyer   august  as you can see calunius helped the lawyer to prepare this article but that did not prevent the lawyer from getting a few things “not quite right” lord justice jackson broadly approved litigation funding in his review of civil litigation costs saying “litigation funding is beneficial and should be supported” it is public knowledge that he set out three issues to be covered in a voluntary code of conduct withdrawal by the funder the funder’s role in settlement negotiations and capital adequacy requirements to be imposed on funders all these issues are now the subject of discussions in a working party chaired by michael napier qc and working under the auspices of the civil justice council leslie perrin the chairman of calunius is a member of the working party there is no reluctance whatsoever on the part of reputable funders to face these issues in fact there is genuine enthusiasm on most funders’ part to set a high bar for the industry’s conduct especially when it comes to financial soundness in this respect observers should bear in
