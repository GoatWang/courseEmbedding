april    pm eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wireas part of its ongoing surveillance fitch ratings has affirmed seven classes of outstanding notes of carmax auto owner trust  a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release key rating drivers the rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement ce and loss performance the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and ce the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents the ratings reflect the quality of carmax business services llcs retail auto loan originations the strength of its servicing capabilities and the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x and x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation to date the transaction has exhibited stable performance with losses within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels therefore a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings due diligence usage no thirdparty due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action fitch has
