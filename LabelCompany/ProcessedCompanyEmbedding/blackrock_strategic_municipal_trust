fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category

college of the holy cross  fund overview objective the investment seeks to provide shareholders with a high level of income exempt from federal income taxes strategy under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its assets in municipal bonds municipal bonds may be obligations of a variety of issuers including governmental entities or other qualifying issuers the payments from which in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer are excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes the fund seeks to maintain an average portfolio duration of zero to ten years it may invest up to  of its net assets in noninvestment grade bonds risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although national municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from federal income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes income from these funds is usually subject to state and local income taxes generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials if available additional disclosures this description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund read the funds prospectus for more detailed information about the fund duration is a measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in interest rates duration differs from maturity in that it considers a securitys interest payments in addition to the amount of time until the security reaches maturity and also takes into account certain maturity shortening features eg demand features interest rate resets and call options when applicable securities with longer durations generally tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations a fund with a longer average duration generally can be expected to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than a fund with a shorter average duration the analysis on these pages may be based in part on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the classs actual inception of  these calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund with an inception date of  adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class when this share classs fees and expenses are higher please refer to a funds prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses these adjusted historical returns are not actual
