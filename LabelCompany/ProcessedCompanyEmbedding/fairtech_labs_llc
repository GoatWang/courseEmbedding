sampling most imported foods fall under the regulatory purview of the federal drug administration fda  established in  the fda’s detention without physical examination dwpe program automatically detains and prevents the sale of items it deems highrisk – due to a history of violations from a manufacturer the appearance that a product is violative or when information indicates future entries may be violative  in order to sell a product detained under dwpe and remove a manufacturer from automatic detention the importer must have a thirdparty laboratory like anresco sample and analyze the product for the presumed violation  if the product is deemed to be “clean” then an analytical packet is sent to the fda recommending the product be releasedanresco laboratories has offered dwpe sampling and analytical services to the import industry since   today it performs almost every analysis required by the fda and is one of the largest and most successful laboratories in the country for dwpe testing accounting for about  of the import testing market  as a result we have accrued significant experience working with every fda district each with its own requirements a reputation for honest and quality work and economies of scale to provide the lowest price possible for our customers  we honestly believe we have the finest analytical group of any private laboratory in the united
