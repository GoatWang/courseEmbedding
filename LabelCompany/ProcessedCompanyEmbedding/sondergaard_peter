who is responsible for product development  management by peter sondergaard    august       comment the only certainty in the business of technology is change and the combined forces of cloud mobility social collaboration and information—something we at gartner call the nexus—is dramatically accelerating the pace and impact of itled business transformation our research agenda which is reflected in this year’s gartner symposiumitxpo agenda httpwwwgartnercomtechnologysymposium continues to focus on each of the four forces of the nexus and how their confluence is changing the it industry the use of it in organizations and the it organization itself for example we examine how the shift to cloud computing is really about the industrialization of it turning the “guild of it” from a craft into an industrial activity we explore how mobility is driving pervasive access between people between machines and between people and machines we continue to conduct researched into how social collaboration is enabling extreme collaboration that is forever changing the way software is designed and lastly how information okay okay big data if you prefer that term although i vehemently try to avoid it – a future blog post for sure is creating an ‘information layer’ in the enterprise that is driving innovative new revenue streams these four forces—individually and in concert—are driving unprecedented change in traditional it but our research also indicates they are fundamentally and profoundly changing business itself see this segment from last years symposium keynote httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvedrrissuc one example of this change driven by the nexus is the inexorable relationship between it and product development how so well if you are a ceo ask yourself this simple question who should now be responsible for leading product development and management the answer is not as clean cut as it once was let me explain why historically in both productcentric and servicescentric businesses product development and management rarely engaged with the it organization today it couldn’t be more different i often speak to executives in servicescentric businesses such as banks where product development and management now resides with the cio we believe this will become the norm across all servicescentric businesses we are starting to see the same shift in productcentric businesses in recent conversations with clevel executives of car manufactures and consumer packaged goods businesses we have discussed this very point it is clear from my conversations that ceos are not fully engaged in what the future structure and governance model of product development and management should be this will become an increasingly urgent issue to resolve as information or data continues to be a strategic asset for organizations it will also become a highstakes competitive negotiation within the csuite for ownership of the information that is generated by products but also used within corporate it systems so what should a ceo do now first find out more from your cio and product development and management team about functional leadership collaboration and performance ask yourself and your team the uncomfortable question about who should now own the product development and management process now that the fundamental relationship with and importance of it has changed additional resources read complimentary relevant research predicts  artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is changing the way in which organizations innovate and

we start to think about the full implications of the internet of everything once your product has left the shelves that used to be the end of the story now – if you can stay connected to your product through its lifecycle – you can turn it into a service you can really understand how it is used maybe you can even deliver further value added services on top for some interesting examples take a look

your life then youre in good companyapple founder steve wozniak atari pong console designer al alcorn and gartner chief research officer peter sondergaard shared memories of the best holiday gifts they ever receivedapples steve wozniak woz designed the legendary apple  after hours from his daytime job at hewlettpackard where he worked in the calculator division when i was about  years old i got a sixtransistor radio that was probably the gadget of my life i slept with it listening to music and faraway stations for years he said when i was about  years old i got a ham radio transmitter kit and a receiver kit these were big projects to build and i had to learn a lot whats hot at techrepublic yes ipad pro is ready to be your work machinewith one baffling exception raspberry pi rival delivers a k android computer for just   ways to minimize fileless malware infections linux essentials bundle techrepublic academy such gifts set wozniak on the path to writing software making his own blue boxes and ultimately conjuring early apple computers first sold in  recent sales of remaining apple  computers approached  million as exclusive collectibles but in  the company only sold about  units total this was noteworthy in the nascent personal computer business yet statistically insignificant compared to hot tech gifts such as home pong consoles there remain two bits of apple  folklore that need correcting in the public consciousness first is the idea that wozniak handbuilt all  apple  computers he and steve jobs outsourced board assembly to multiple manufacturing companies activity at the jobs household was limited to final assembly sales and testing before delivering the finished products wozniak stopped by when there were problems but he devoted spare time to developing the apple ii in his hp cubicle not hanging around the garage second is the notion that wozniak was a socially clueless engineer who needed jobs to show him the future impact and opportunity of personal microcomputing woz already knew this as did many other engineers in the mids jobs role was not to make wozniak understand but to make him care enough to leave his solid job at hp and start their own company see apples first employee the remarkable odyssey of bill fernandez techrepublic there were several other computers that a tech hobbyist could purchase in  some were in the apple  price range but most of these defaulted to hexadecimal keypads for input and primitive led displays for output there were also some that offered standard keyboards and video displays but these cost many thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred what made the apple  unique was its hobbyistcentric price and businessclass packaging woz still loves gadgets he said his recent technology gifts include include smartwatches iphone accessories and electric cars a seismic change happened in  wozniaks own apple ii the commodore pet  and the radio shack trs model  all made the apple  and its immediate peers fairly obsolete ordinary consumers could buy a fully preassembled computer take it home plug it in and it just worked neither the apple  nor its  cousins were the first computers but their importance today is unquestioned yet none of these computers came close to being the hottest tech gifts of december  video game consoles were far more accessible to most people the coleco telstar fairchild model f magnavox odyssey and rca studio ii all debuted in  ataris video computer system later called the atari  in  was the eventual smash hitataris al alcorn my favorite gift was a full size gilbert
