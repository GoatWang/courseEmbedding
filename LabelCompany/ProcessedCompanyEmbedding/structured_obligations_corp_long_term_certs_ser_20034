securities rates of return vary and are generally paid at maturity along with the face amount of the investment subject to the credit risk of the issuer open an account reasons to consider structured products market participation access to alternative asset classes intent to hold until maturity find new issue structured products find structured productslog in required structured products from fidelity fidelity currently offers new issue structured products that are either marketlinked eg equity or currency indexes certificates of deposit which carry fdic insurance protection on the invested principal subject to fdic coverage limits  per account owner per institution or senior unsecured obligations of the issuer which are not fdicinsured how they work features  benefits risks examples types how they work as with any new issue offering prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period at issuance customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted however submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation if the offering is oversubscribed more securities were requested than available for purchase and you did not withdraw your order you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested or none at all further if the offering is undersubscribed the offering can be pulled investments in structured products that are fdicinsured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank this underlying cd provides the fdic protection on this investment nonfdicinsured structured products have no cd issuance with these investments which are unsecured debt customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer components of fidelity’s structured products the structured products offered through fidelitycom include the following components payout profile fidelity currently offers only a pointtopoint payout profile a payout profile represents how a customers cumulative return is measured the return of the structured products available on fidelitycom is measured based on two points point a initial or starting index level which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date and point b final index level which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document the product will provide its investment return based on the following formula final index level – starting index level starting index level certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a cap or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket see below participation rate the potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate if the participation rate of the structured product is less than  the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket for example if the participation rate is  the investor will receive only  of any positive return on the index or basket assuming no other limits on return potential the participation rate will vary by product and factors such as index type maturity and caps affect the rate cap a cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket in other words if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return for example if a structured product allows for  participation in an index subject to a  cap the investor cannot earn more than  on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that costs and fees placement fees structuring development and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing taxes structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes this means youll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity in addition any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details features  benefits market participation investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index but is subject to issuer credit and default risk access to alternative asset classes investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access risks credit and default risk structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer therefore the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product in summary if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy the investor may lose all or some of the investment in the case of fdicinsured marketlinked cds deposit amounts exceeding applicable fdic coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank other limitations on fdic coverage may apply structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not fdicinsured in the event of issuer default on a nonfdicinsured product repayment of principal would be subject to the issuers restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed limited fdic protection for fdicinsured marketlinked cds fdic coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not fdicinsured if you hold more than the fdicinsured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank you will not receive the benefit of fdic insurance for any balance in excess of fdic limits in this instance amounts in excess of fdicinsured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank liquidity risk structured products are intended to be held until maturity due to a limited secondary market it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity additionally should a secondary market exist investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss market or opportunity risk the potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket the return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security derivatives risk the issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives andor trading in one or more instruments such as options swaps or futures the costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market commodity price risk if the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile the performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities currency and exchange rate risk if the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket you may be subject to foreign currency risks the value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits domestic and foreign inflation rates domestic and foreign interest rates and global or regional political regulatory economic or financial events performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates examples the scenarios presented below are hypothetical actual investment performance may differ in all cases return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor scenario  the index rises assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index in this scenario the index rose  over the life of the structured product in other words it was up  between purchase date and maturity further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate given these conditions the return to the investor would be   ×  ×  so at maturity the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  index return amount for a total of  scenario  the index falls in this scenario assume return is again tied to the performance of the sp ® index but in this case the index falls  over the life of the structured product the customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product assuming it was  then regardless of how far the index fell the customer would receive a full return ie  of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term in this example the customer invested  and would receive it back at maturity scenario  a capped return in this final scenario again assume return is tied to the performance of the sp ® index assume again that the index rose  over the life of the structured product further assume an original investment of  and an  participation rate finally assume a cap of  given these conditions the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of   ×  ×  or the cap amount of   ×  so in this scenario the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal plus the  cap index return amount for a total of  these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security taxes inflation fees andor expenses were not taken into account if they had been deducted performance would have been lower past performance is not a guarantee of future results your performance will vary and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity before you start you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples types type index underlying asset principal return at

instrument offered to large financial institutions or companies that have complex financing needs that dont match with conventional financial productssince the mids structured finance has become a substantial space in the financial industry collateralized debt obligations cdos synthetic financial instruments collateralized bond obligations cbos and syndicated loans are all examples of structured finance instruments breaking down structured finance structured finance is typically indicated for borrowers – mostly extensive corporations – that have unique or highly specified needs a simple loan or other type of conventional financial instrument will not suffice to resolve such need in most cases structured finance involves one or several discretionary transactions to be completed and thus evolved and often risky instruments must be implementedexamples of structured finance productsinstrumentswhen a standard loan is not enough to cover unique transactions dictated by a corporations operational needs for example a number of different structured finance products may be implemented along with cdos and cbos instruments such as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos credit default swaps cdss and hybrid securities combining elements of debt and equity securities are often utilizedsignificance and benefitsstructured financial products are typically not offered by traditional lenders generally because structured finance is required for major capital injection into a business or organization investors are required to provide such financing structured financial products are almost always nontransferrable meaning that they cannot be transferred between various types of debt in the same way that a standard loan ismore and more structured financing and securitization are used by corporations governments and financial intermediaries in advancing evolving and complex emerging markets to manage risk develop financial markets expand business reach and design new funding instruments for these entities using structured financing transforms cash flows and reshapes the liquidity of financial portfoliossecuritizationsecuritization is the process through which a financial instrument is created by combining financial assets various tiers of these repackaged instruments are then sold off to investors securitization much like structured finance promotes liquidity and is also used to develop the structured financial products used by uniquely qualified businesses and other customersa mortgagebacked security mbs is a model example of securitization mortgages may be grouped into one large pool leaving the issuer the opportunity to divide the pool into pieces that are based on the risk of default inherent to each mortgage the smaller pieces may

cdos evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgagebacked security mbs markets like other private label securities backed by assets a cdo can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence based on the cash flow the cdo collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns the cdo is sliced into tranches which catch the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority if some loans default and the cash collected by the cdo is insufficient to pay all of its investors those in the lowest most junior tranches suffer losses first the last to lose payment from default are the safest most senior tranches consequently coupon payments and interest rates vary by tranche with the safestmost senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk as an example a cdo might issue the following tranches in order of safeness senior aaa sometimes known as super senior junior aaa aa a bbb residual separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the cdos and pay interest to investors as cdos developed some sponsors repackaged tranches

during the s the collateral of cdos was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans after  multisector cdos were developed by prudential securities but cdos remained fairly obscure until after  in  and  cdos had a setback when rating agencies were forced to downgrade hundreds of the securities but sales of cdos grew—from  billion in  to around  billion in  from  through   trillion worth of cdos were issued early cdos were diversified and might include everything from aircraft leaseequipment debt manufactured housing loans to student loans and credit card debt the diversification of borrowers in these multisector cdos was a selling point as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected another selling point was that cdos offered returns that were sometimes  percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating explanations for growthedit advantages of securitization  depository banks had incentive to securitize loans they originated—often in the form of cdo securities—because this removes the loans from their books the transfer of these loans along with related risk to securitybuying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks capital this enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees global demand for fixed income investments  from  to  worldwide fixed income investment ie investments in bonds and other conservative securities roughly doubled in size to  trillion yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgagebacked security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies low interest rates  fears of deflation the bursting of the dotcom bubble a us recession and the us trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from  to  according to economist mark zandi the low yield of the safe us treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgagebacked cdos with their relatively highyields but credit ratings as

market continued to grow subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral by  mortgagebacked securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in cdos according to the financial crisis inquiry report the cdo became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain promoting an increase in demand for mortgagebacked securities without which lenders would have had less reason to push so hard to make nonprime loans cdos not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgagebacked securities they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities between  and  wall street issued almost  billion in cdos that included mortgagebacked securities as collateral despite this loss of diversification cdo tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so uncorrelated—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default the rise of ratings arbitrage—ie pooling lowrated tranches to make cdos—helped push sales of cdos to about  billion in  with a global cdo market of over usd  trillion cdo was the fastestgrowing sector of the structured finance market between  and  the number of cdo tranches issued in   was almost twice the number of tranches issued in   cdos like mortgagebacked securities were financed with debt enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course explanations for growthedit subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgagebacked securities mbs like cdos mbss were structured into tranches but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower levellowerrated mezzanine tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from aa to bb because most traditional mortgage investors are riskaverse either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices they are interested in buying the higherrated segments of the loan stack as a result those slices are easiest to sell the more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile the way mortgage securities are structured if you cannot find buyers for the lowerrated slices the rest of the pool cannot be sold to deal with the problem investment bankers recycled the mezzanine tranches selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—cdos though the pool that made up the cdo collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches most of the tranches  to  of the cdo were rated not bbb a etc but triple a the minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other cdos concentrating the lower rated tranches still further see chart on the theory of how the financial system created aaarated assets out of subprime mortgages as one journalist gretchen morgenson put it cdos became the perfect dumping ground for the lowrated slices wall street couldnt sell on its own other factors explaining the popularity of cdos include growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued a global savings glut leading to large capital inflows from abroad helped finance the housing boom keeping down us mortgage rates even after the federal reserve bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy supply generated by hefty fees the cdo industry earned according to one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in cdos as much as  to  percent of the cash flow generated by the assets in a cdo went to pay the bankers the cdo manager the rating agencies and others who took out fees rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the cdo tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by cdo issuers—earned extraordinary profits moodys investors service one of the two biggest rating agencies could earn as much as  to rate a mortgage pool with  million in assets versus the  in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size in  revenues from moodys

terms of margins than exxon mobil or microsoft between the time moodys was spun off as a public company and february  its stock rose  trust in rating agencies cdo managers didnt always have to disclose what the securities contained because the contents of the cdo were subject to change but this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities investors werent so much buying a security they were buying a triplea rating according to business journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera financial innovations such as credit default swaps and synthetic cdo credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premiumlike payments making cdos appear to be virtually riskfree to investors synthetic cdos were cheaper and easier to create than original cash cdos synthetics referenced cash cdos replacing interest payments from mbs tranches with premiumlike payments from credit default swaps rather than providing funding for housing synthetic cdobuying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default if the cdo did not perform per contractual requirements one counterparty typically a large investment bank or hedge fund had to pay another as underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated subprime mortgages became less abundant synthetic cdos began to fill in for the original cash cdos because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically crashedit more than half of the highestrated aaa cdos were impaired losing principal or downgraded to junk status compared to a small fraction of similarly rated subprime and alta mortgagebacked securities source financial crisis inquiry report in the summer of  the caseshiller index of house prices peaked in california home prices had more than doubled since  and median house prices in los angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income to entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages down payments income documentation were often

this possible  expired mortgage payments skyrocketed refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices mezzanine tranches started to lose value in  by mid year aa tranches were worth only  cents on the dollar by october triplea tranches had started to fall regional diversification notwithstanding the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated big cdo arrangers like citigroup merrill lynch and ubs experienced some of the biggest losses as did financial guaranteers such as aig ambac mbia an early indicator of the crisis came in july  when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgagerelated securities by the end of   of cdo securities were downgraded and two highly leveraged bear stearns hedge funds

after reporting multibilliondollar losses and cdo downgrades as the global market for cdos dried up the new issue pipeline for cdos slowed significantly and what cdo issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middlemarket or leveraged bank loans rather than home mortgage abs the cdo collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger mbs market depended on cdo purchases of mezzanine tranches while nonprime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages cdos were especially hard hit more than half   billion worth—of tranches issued in   and  rated most safe—triple a  by rating agencies were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by  in comparison only small fractions of triple a tranches of alta or subprime mortgagebacked securities suffered the same fate see impaired securities chart collateralized debt obligations cdos also made up over half  billion of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from  to early  criticismedit prior to the crisis a few academics analysts and investors such as warren buffett who famously disparaged cdos and other derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction carrying dangers that while now latent are potentially lethal and the imfs former chief economist raghuram rajan warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification cdos and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widelycitation needed during and after the crisis criticism of the cdo market was more vocal according to the radio documentary giant pool of money it was the strong demand for mbs and cdo that drove down home lending standards mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted the head of banking supervision and regulation at the federal reserve patrick parkinson termed the whole concept of abs cdos an abomination in december  journalists carrick mollenkamp and serena ng wrote of a cdo called norma created by merrill lynch at the behest of illinois hedge fund magnetar it was a tailormade bet on subprime mortgages that went too far janet tavakoli a chicago consultant who specializes in cdos said norma is a tangled hairball of risk when it came to market in march  any savvy investor would have thrown thisin the trash bin according to journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera no securities became more pervasive  or did more damage than collateralized debt obligations to create the great recession gretchen morgenson described the securities as a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages that created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders cdos prolonged the mania vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like citigroup and the american international group  in the first quarter of  alone credit rating agencies announced  downgrades of cdos at least some analysts complained the agencies overrelied on computer models with imprecise inputs failed to account adequately for large risks like a nationwide collapse of housing values and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up cdos would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated and when one mortgage defaulted many did affected by the same financial events they were strongly criticized by economist joseph stiglitz among others stiglitz considered the agencies one of the key culprits of the crisis that performed that alchemy that converted the securities from frated to arated the banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies according to morgenson the agencies had pretended to transform dross into gold as usual the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of wall streets rocket scientists fitch moodys and sp paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend accommodate and impress the wall street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay  their the rating agencies failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate michael lewis also pronounced the transformation of bbb tranches into  triple a cdos as dishonest artificial and the result of fat fees paid to rating agencies by goldman sachs and other wall street firms however if the collateral had been sufficient those ratings would have been correct according to the fdic synthetic cdos were criticized in particular because of the difficulties to judge and price the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly that adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lenders incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization according to economist mark zandi as shaky mortgages were combined diluting any problems into a larger pool the incentive for responsibility was undermined zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation finance companies werent subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks taxpayers werent on the hook if they went belly up precrisis only their shareholders and other creditors were finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards concept structures varietiesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message conceptedit cdos vary in structure and underlying assets but the basic principle is the same a cdo is a type of assetbacked security to create a cdo a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors a sequence in constructing a cdo is a special purpose entity spe is designedconstructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets common underlying assets held may include mortgagebacked securities commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans the spe issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets like other abs private label securities the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches each with different risk characteristics senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches losses are first borne by the equity tranches next by the junior tranches and finally by the senior tranches a common analogy compares the cash flow from the cdos portfolio of securities say mortgage payments from mortgagebacked bonds to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches then equity tranches if a large portion of the mortgages enter default there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first the risk and return for a cdo investor depends both on how the tranches are defined and on the underlying assets in particular the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches cdos like all assetbacked securities enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors thus investors must understand how the risk for cdos is calculated the issuer of the cdo typically an investment bank earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the cdo the ability to earn substantial fees from originating cdos coupled with the absence of any residual liability skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality in some cases the assets held by one cdo consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other cdos this explains why some cdos became entirely worthless as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasnt sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages many of which defaulted to trickle down to the equity layers structuresedit cdo refers to several different types of products the primary classifications are as follows source of funds—cash flow vs market value cash flow cdos pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the cdos assets cash flow cdos focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio market value cdos attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets the cdo asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the cdos portfolio there is greater focus on the changes in market value of the cdos assets market value cdos are longerestablished but less common than cash flow cdos motivation—arbitrage vs balance sheet arbitrage transactions cash flow and market value attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds the majority  of cdos are arbitragemotivated balance sheet transactions by contrast are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital a bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheets credit risk funding—cash vs synthetic cash cdos involve a portfolio of cash assets such as loans corporate bonds assetbacked securities or mortgagebacked securities ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle issuing the cdos tranches the risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority cash cdo issuance exceeded  billion in  synthetic cdos do not own cash assets like bonds or loans instead synthetic cdos gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps a derivatives instrument under such a swap the credit protection seller the cdo receives periodic cash payments called premiums in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event like a cash cdo the risk of loss on the cdos portfolio is divided into tranches losses will first affect the equity tranche next the junior tranches and finally the senior tranche each tranche receives a periodic payment the swap premium with the junior tranches offering higher premiums a synthetic cdo tranche may be either funded or unfunded under the swap agreements the cdo could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the cdos reference portfolio some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches typically the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing until a credit event occurs the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in highquality liquid assets or placed in a gic guaranteed investment contract account that offers a return that is a few basis points below libor the return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches when a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required the required payment is made from the gic or reserve account that holds the liquid investments in contrast senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower unlike a cash cdo investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the cdo when entering into the investment instead the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the cdo in the event the portfolios losses reach the senior tranche funded synthetic issuance exceeded  billion in  from an issuance perspective synthetic cdos take less time to create cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed and the cdos tranches can be precisely structured hybrid cdos have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash cdos—and swaps that give the cdo credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic cdo a portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps the cdo receives payments from three sources the return from the cash assets the gic or reserve account investments and the cdo premiums singletranche cdos the flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct single tranche cdos bespoke tranche cdos where the entire cdo is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models residual risk is deltahedged by the dealer structured operating companies unlike cdos which are terminating structures that typically winddown or refinance at the end of their financing term structured operating companies are permanently capitalized variants of cdos with an active management team and infrastructure they often issue term notes commercial paper andor auction rate securities depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company credit derivative products companies cdpc and structured investment vehicles siv are examples with cdpc taking risk synthetically and siv with predominantly cash exposure taxationedit the issuer of a cdo—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the united states to avoid being subject to us federal income taxation on its global income these corporations must restrict their activities to avoid us tax corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the us will be subject to federal taxation foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of us stock and debt securities are not investing unlike trading or dealing is not considered to be a trade or business regardless of its volume or frequency in addition a safe harbor protects cdo issuers that do trade actively in securities even though trading in securities technically is a business provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking lending or similar businesses cdos are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of cdos which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules such as pfic and cfc reporting the pfic and cfc reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax reporting typesedit a based on the underlying asset

unit trusts investment trusts commercial banks investment banks pension fund managers private banking organizations other cdos and structured investment vehicles investors have different motivations for purchasing cdo securities depending on which tranche they select at the more senior levels of debt investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities eg corporate bonds of a similar rating in some cases investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing this is true because senior tranches pay a spread above libor despite their aaaratings investors also benefit from the diversification of the cdo portfolio the expertise of the asset manager and the credit support built into the transaction investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged nonrecourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities investors include hedge funds banks and wealthy individuals underwriteredit the underwriter of a cdo is typically an investment bank and acts as the structurer and arranger working with the asset management firm that selects the cdos portfolio the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches this includes selecting the debttoequity ratio sizing each tranche establishing coverage and collateral quality tests and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche the key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders such a determination requires estimating the afterdefault return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the cdos rated notes the excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive irrs to the equityholders other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle typically a trust incorporated in the cayman islands that will purchase the assets and issue the cdos tranches in addition the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the postclosing trading restrictions that will be included in the cdos transaction documents and other files the final step is to price the cdo ie set the coupons for each debt tranche and place the tranches with investors the priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches a bbb etc of the cdo it is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche in addition the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the cdo especially its more senior tranches according to thomson financial the top underwriters before september  were bear stearns merrill lynch wachovia citigroup deutsche bank and bank of america securities cdos are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved the underwriter is paid a fee when the cdo is issued the asset manageredit the asset manager plays a key role in each cdo transaction even after the cdo is issued an experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the cdos portfolio the manager can maintain the credit quality of a cdos portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur in theory the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below although in practice this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mids decade in addition it is now understood that the structural flaw in all assetbacked securities originators profit from loan volume not loan quality make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment the asset managers role begins in the months before a cdo is issued a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming cdo this process is called warehousing even by the issuance date the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the cdos portfolio a rampup period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the cdo is issued for this reason some senior cdo notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made when a transaction is fully ramped its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager however the asset managers role continues even after the rampup period ends albeit in a less active role during the cdos reinvestment period which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the cdo the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the cdos transaction documents the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the cdos portfolio the manager also has a role in the redemption of a cdos notes by auction call there are approximately  asset managers in the marketplace cdo asset managers as with other asset managers can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the cdo asset managers make money by virtue of the senior fee which is paid before any of the cdo investors are paid and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the cdo making cdos a lucrative business for asset managers these fees together with underwriting fees administration—approx     by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment by virtue of reduced cashflow see also list of cdo managers the trustee and collateral administratoredit the trustee holds title to the assets of the cdo for the benefit of the noteholders ie the investors in the cdo market the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator in this role the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models in contrast to the asset manager there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace the following institutions offer trustee services in the cdo marketplace bank of new york mellon note the bank of new york mellon

underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the cdos portfolio of debt securities this entails verifying certain attributes such as credit rating and couponspread of each collateral security source documents or public sources will typically be used to tieout the collateral pool information in addition the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests the firm may also perform a cash flow tieout in which the transactions waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents the yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter on each payment date an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders attorneysedit attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose

the corporate debt markets over time cdos evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgagebacked security mbs markets like other private label securities backed by assets a cdo can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence based on the cash flow the cdo collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns the cdo is sliced into tranches which catch the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority if some loans default and the cash collected by the cdo is insufficient to pay all of its investors those in the lowest most junior tranches suffer losses first the last to lose payment from default are the safest most senior tranches consequently coupon payments and interest rates vary by tranche with the safestmost senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk as an example a cdo might issue the following tranches in order of safeness senior aaa sometimes known as super senior junior aaa aa a bbb residual separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the cdos and pay interest to investors

market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed cdo collateral became dominated not by loans but by lower level bbb or a tranches recycled from other assetbacked securities whose assets

inc for the also nowdefunct imperial savings association during the s the collateral of cdos was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans after  multisector cdos were developed by prudential securities but cdos remained fairly obscure until after  in  and  cdos had a setback when rating agencies were forced to downgrade hundreds of the securities but sales of cdos grew—from  billion in  to around  billion in  from  through   trillion worth of cdos were issued early cdos were diversified and might include everything from aircraft leaseequipment debt manufactured housing loans to student loans and credit card debt the diversification of borrowers in these multisector cdos was a selling point as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected another selling point was that cdos offered returns that were sometimes  percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating explanations for growthedit advantages of securitization  depository banks had incentive to securitize loans they originated—often in the form of cdo securities—because this removes the loans from their books the transfer of these loans along with related risk to securitybuying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks capital this enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees global demand for fixed income investments  from  to  worldwide fixed income investment ie investments in bonds and other conservative securities roughly doubled in size to  trillion yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgagebacked security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies low interest rates  fears of deflation the bursting of the dotcom bubble a us recession and the us trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from  to  according to economist mark zandi the low yield of the safe us treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgagebacked cdos with their relatively highyields but credit ratings as high as the treasuries this search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase cdos though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating

than half of the collateral in cdos according to the financial crisis inquiry report the cdo became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain promoting an increase in demand for mortgagebacked securities without which lenders would have had less reason to push so hard to make nonprime loans cdos not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgagebacked securities they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities between  and  wall street issued almost  billion in cdos that included mortgagebacked securities as collateral despite this loss of diversification cdo tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so uncorrelated—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default the rise of ratings arbitrage—ie pooling lowrated tranches to make cdos—helped push sales of cdos to about  billion in  with a global cdo market of over usd  trillion cdo was the fastestgrowing sector of the structured finance market between  and  the number of cdo tranches issued in   was almost twice the number of tranches issued in   cdos like mortgagebacked securities were

like cdos mbss were structured into tranches but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower levellowerrated mezzanine tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from aa to bb because most traditional mortgage investors are riskaverse either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices they are interested in buying the higherrated segments of the loan stack as a result those slices are easiest to sell the more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile the way mortgage securities are structured if you cannot find buyers for the lowerrated slices the rest of the pool cannot be sold to deal with the problem investment bankers recycled the mezzanine tranches selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—cdos though the pool that made up the cdo collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches most of the tranches  to  of the cdo were rated not bbb a etc but triple a the minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other cdos concentrating the lower rated tranches still further see chart on the theory of how the financial system created aaarated assets out of subprime mortgages as one journalist gretchen morgenson put it cdos became the perfect dumping ground for the lowrated slices wall street couldnt sell on its own other factors explaining the popularity of cdos include growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued a global savings glut leading to large capital inflows from abroad helped finance the housing boom keeping down us mortgage rates even after the federal reserve bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy supply generated by hefty fees the cdo industry earned according to one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in cdos as much as  to  percent of the cash flow generated by the assets in a cdo went to pay the bankers the cdo manager the rating agencies and others who took out fees rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the cdo tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by cdo issuers—earned extraordinary profits moodys investors service one of the two biggest rating agencies could earn as much as  to rate a mortgage pool with  million in assets versus the  in fees generated when rating a municipal

profitable companies in existence—more profitable in terms of margins than exxon mobil or microsoft between the time moodys was spun off as a public company and february  its stock rose  trust in rating agencies cdo managers didnt always have to disclose what the securities contained because the contents of the cdo were subject to change but this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities investors werent so much buying a security they were buying a triplea rating according to business journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera financial innovations such as credit default swaps and synthetic cdo credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premiumlike payments making cdos appear to be virtually riskfree to investors synthetic cdos were cheaper and easier to create than original cash cdos synthetics referenced cash cdos replacing interest payments from mbs tranches with premiumlike payments from credit default swaps rather than providing funding for housing synthetic cdobuying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default if the cdo did not perform per contractual requirements one counterparty typically a large investment bank or hedge fund had to pay another as underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated subprime mortgages became less abundant synthetic cdos began to fill in for the original cash cdos because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically crashedit more than half of the highestrated aaa cdos were impaired losing principal or downgraded to junk status compared to a small fraction of similarly rated subprime and alta mortgagebacked securities source financial crisis inquiry report in the summer of  the caseshiller index of house prices peaked in california home prices had more than doubled since  and median house prices in los angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income to entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages down

notwithstanding the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated big cdo arrangers like citigroup merrill lynch and ubs experienced some of the biggest losses as did financial guaranteers such as aig ambac mbia an early indicator of the crisis came in july  when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgagerelated securities by the end of   of cdo securities were downgraded and two highly leveraged bear stearns hedge funds holding mbss and cdos collapsed investors were informed by bear stearns that they would get little if any of their money

for cdos slowed significantly and what cdo issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middlemarket or leveraged bank loans rather than home mortgage abs the cdo collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger mbs market depended on cdo purchases of mezzanine tranches while nonprime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by

by  in comparison only small fractions of triple a tranches of alta or subprime mortgagebacked securities suffered the same fate see impaired securities chart collateralized debt obligations cdos also made up over half  billion of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from  to early  criticismedit prior to the crisis a few academics analysts and investors such as warren buffett who famously disparaged cdos and other derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction carrying dangers that while now latent are potentially lethal and the imfs former chief economist raghuram rajan warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification cdos and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widelycitation needed during and after the crisis criticism of the cdo market was more vocal according to the radio documentary giant pool of money it was the strong demand for mbs and cdo that drove down home lending standards mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted the head of banking supervision and regulation at the federal reserve patrick parkinson termed the whole concept of abs cdos an abomination in december  journalists carrick mollenkamp and serena ng wrote of a cdo called norma created by merrill lynch at the behest of illinois hedge fund magnetar it was a tailormade bet on subprime mortgages that went too far janet tavakoli a chicago consultant who specializes in cdos said norma is a tangled hairball of risk when it came to market in march  any savvy investor would have thrown thisin the trash bin according to journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera no securities became more pervasive  or did more damage than collateralized debt obligations to create the great recession gretchen morgenson described the securities as a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages that created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders cdos prolonged the mania vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like citigroup and the american international group  in the first quarter of  alone credit rating agencies announced  downgrades of cdos at least some analysts complained the agencies overrelied on computer models with imprecise inputs failed to account adequately for large risks like a nationwide collapse of housing values and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up cdos would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated and when one mortgage defaulted many did affected by the same financial events they were strongly criticized by economist joseph stiglitz among others stiglitz considered the agencies one of the key culprits of the crisis that performed that alchemy that converted the securities from frated to arated the banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies according to morgenson the agencies had pretended to transform dross into gold as usual the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of wall streets rocket scientists fitch moodys and sp paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend accommodate and impress the wall street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay  their the rating agencies failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate michael lewis also pronounced the transformation of bbb tranches into  triple a cdos as dishonest artificial and the result of fat fees paid to rating agencies by goldman sachs and other wall street firms however if the collateral had been sufficient those ratings would have been correct according to the fdic synthetic cdos were criticized in particular because of the difficulties to judge and price the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly that adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lenders incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization according to economist mark zandi as shaky mortgages were combined diluting any problems into a larger pool the incentive for responsibility was undermined zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation finance companies werent subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks taxpayers werent on the hook if they went belly up precrisis only their shareholders and other creditors were finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards concept structures varietiesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message conceptedit cdos vary in structure and underlying assets but the basic principle is the same a cdo is a type of assetbacked security to create a cdo a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors a sequence in constructing a cdo is a special purpose entity spe is designedconstructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets common underlying assets held may include mortgagebacked securities commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans the spe issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets like other abs private label securities the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches each with different risk characteristics senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches losses are first borne by the equity tranches next by the junior tranches and finally by the senior tranches a common analogy compares the cash flow from the cdos portfolio of securities say mortgage payments from mortgagebacked bonds to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches then equity tranches if a large portion of the mortgages enter default there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first the risk and return for a cdo investor depends both on how the tranches are defined and on the underlying assets in particular the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches cdos like all assetbacked securities enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors thus investors must understand how the risk for cdos is calculated the issuer of the cdo typically an investment bank earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the cdo the ability to earn substantial fees from originating cdos coupled with the absence of any residual liability skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality in some cases the assets held by one cdo consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other cdos this explains why some cdos became entirely worthless as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasnt sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages many of which defaulted to trickle down to the equity layers structuresedit cdo refers to several different types of products the primary classifications are as follows source of funds—cash flow vs market value cash flow cdos pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the cdos assets cash flow cdos focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio market value cdos attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets the cdo asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the cdos portfolio there is greater focus on the changes in market value of the cdos assets market value cdos are longerestablished but less common than cash flow cdos motivation—arbitrage vs balance sheet arbitrage transactions cash flow and market value attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds the majority  of cdos are arbitragemotivated balance sheet transactions by contrast are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital a bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheets credit risk funding—cash vs synthetic cash cdos involve a portfolio of cash assets such as loans corporate bonds assetbacked securities or mortgagebacked securities ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle issuing the cdos tranches the risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority cash cdo issuance exceeded  billion in  synthetic cdos do not own cash assets like bonds or loans instead synthetic cdos gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps a derivatives instrument under such a swap the credit protection seller the cdo receives periodic cash payments called premiums in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event like a cash cdo the risk of loss on the cdos portfolio is divided into tranches losses will first affect the equity tranche next the junior tranches and finally the senior tranche each tranche receives a periodic payment the swap premium with the junior tranches offering higher premiums a synthetic cdo tranche may be either funded or unfunded under the swap agreements the cdo could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the cdos reference portfolio some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches typically the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing until a credit event occurs the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in highquality liquid assets or placed in a gic guaranteed investment contract account that offers a return that is a few basis points below libor the return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches when a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required the required payment is made from the gic or reserve account that holds the liquid investments in contrast senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower unlike a cash cdo investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the cdo when entering into the investment instead the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the cdo in the event the portfolios losses reach the senior tranche funded synthetic issuance exceeded  billion in  from an issuance perspective synthetic cdos take less time to create cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed and the cdos tranches can be precisely structured hybrid cdos have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash cdos—and swaps that give the cdo credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic cdo a portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps the cdo receives payments from three sources the return from the cash assets the gic or reserve account investments and the cdo premiums singletranche cdos the flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct single tranche cdos bespoke tranche cdos where the entire cdo is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models residual risk is deltahedged by the dealer structured operating companies unlike cdos which are terminating structures that typically winddown or refinance at the end of their financing term structured operating companies are permanently capitalized variants of cdos with an active management team and infrastructure they often issue term notes commercial paper andor auction rate securities depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company credit derivative products companies cdpc and structured investment vehicles siv are examples with cdpc taking risk synthetically and siv with predominantly cash exposure taxationedit the issuer of a cdo—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the united states to avoid being subject to us federal income taxation on its global income these corporations must restrict their activities to avoid us tax corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the us will be subject to federal taxation foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of us stock and debt securities are not investing unlike trading or dealing is not considered to be a trade or business regardless of its volume or frequency in addition a safe harbor protects cdo issuers that do trade actively in securities even though trading in securities technically is a business provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking lending or similar businesses cdos are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of cdos which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules such as pfic and cfc reporting the pfic and cfc reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax

companies mutual fund companies unit trusts investment trusts commercial banks investment banks pension fund managers private banking organizations other cdos and structured investment vehicles investors have different motivations for purchasing cdo securities depending on which tranche they select at the more senior levels of debt investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities eg corporate bonds of a similar rating in some cases investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing this is true because senior tranches pay a spread above libor despite their aaaratings investors also benefit from the diversification of the cdo portfolio the expertise of the asset manager and the credit support built into the transaction investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged nonrecourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities investors include hedge funds banks and wealthy individuals underwriteredit the underwriter of a cdo is typically an investment bank and acts as the structurer and arranger working with the asset management firm that selects the cdos portfolio the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches this includes selecting the debttoequity ratio sizing each tranche establishing coverage and collateral quality tests and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche the key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders such a determination requires estimating the afterdefault return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the cdos rated notes the excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive irrs to the equityholders other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle typically a trust incorporated in the cayman islands that will purchase the assets and issue the cdos tranches in addition the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the postclosing trading restrictions that will be included in the cdos transaction documents and other files the final step is to price the cdo ie set the coupons for each debt tranche and place the tranches with investors the priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches a bbb etc of the cdo it is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche in addition the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the cdo especially its more senior tranches according to thomson financial the top underwriters before september  were bear stearns merrill lynch wachovia citigroup deutsche bank and bank of america securities cdos are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved the underwriter is paid a fee when the cdo is issued the asset manageredit the asset manager plays a key role in each cdo transaction even after the cdo is issued an experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the cdos portfolio the manager can maintain the credit quality of a cdos portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur in theory the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below although in practice this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mids decade in addition it is now understood that the structural flaw in all assetbacked securities originators profit from loan volume not loan quality make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment the asset managers role begins in the months before a cdo is issued a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming cdo this process is called warehousing even by the issuance date the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the cdos portfolio a rampup period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the cdo is issued for this reason some senior cdo notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made when a transaction is fully ramped its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager however the asset managers role continues even after the rampup period ends albeit in a less active role during the cdos reinvestment period which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the cdo the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the cdos transaction documents the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the cdos portfolio the manager also has a role in the redemption of a cdos notes by auction call there are approximately  asset managers in the marketplace cdo asset managers as with other asset managers can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the cdo asset managers make money by virtue of the senior fee which is paid before any of the cdo investors are paid and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the cdo making cdos a lucrative business for asset managers these fees together with underwriting fees administration—approx     by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment by virtue of reduced cashflow see also list of cdo managers the trustee and collateral administratoredit the trustee holds title to the assets of the cdo for the benefit of the noteholders ie the investors in the cdo market the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator in this role the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models in contrast to the asset manager there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace the following institutions offer trustee services in the cdo marketplace bank of new york mellon note the bank of

the underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the cdos portfolio of debt securities this entails verifying certain attributes such as credit rating and couponspread of each collateral security source documents or public sources will typically be used to tieout the collateral pool information in addition the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests the firm may also perform a cash flow tieout in which the transactions waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents the yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter on each payment date an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders attorneysedit attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements

clearing house related areas banks and banking finance corporate personal public v t e a collateralized debt obligation cdo is a type of structured assetbacked security abs originally developed for the corporate debt markets over time cdos evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgagebacked security mbs markets like other private label securities backed by assets a cdo can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence based on the cash flow the cdo collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns the cdo is sliced into tranches which catch the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority if some loans default and the cash collected by the cdo is insufficient to pay all of its investors those in the lowest most junior tranches suffer losses first the last to lose payment from default are the safest most senior tranches consequently coupon payments and interest rates vary by tranche with the safestmost senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk as an example a cdo might issue the following tranches in order of safeness senior aaa sometimes known as super senior junior aaa aa a bbb residual separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the cdos and pay interest to investors as cdos developed some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration known as cdosquared cdos of cdos or synthetic cdos in the early s cdos were generally diversified but by –—when the cdo market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed cdo collateral became dominated not by loans but by lower level bbb or a tranches recycled from other assetbacked securities whose assets were usually subprime mortgages and are known as a synthetic cdo these cdos have been called the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain for subprime mortgages and are credited with giving

inc for the also nowdefunct imperial savings association during the s the collateral of cdos was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans after  multisector cdos were developed by prudential securities but cdos remained fairly obscure until after  in  and  cdos had a setback when rating agencies were forced to downgrade hundreds of the securities but sales of cdos grew—from  billion in  to around  billion in  from  through   trillion worth of cdos were issued early cdos were diversified and might include everything from aircraft leaseequipment debt manufactured housing loans to student loans and credit card debt the diversification of borrowers in these multisector cdos was a selling point as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected another selling point was that cdos offered returns that were sometimes  percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating explanations for growthedit advantages of securitization  depository banks had incentive to securitize loans they originated—often in the form of cdo securities—because this removes the loans from their books the transfer of these loans along with related risk to securitybuying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks capital this enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees global demand for fixed income investments  from  to  worldwide fixed income investment ie investments in bonds and other conservative securities roughly doubled in size to  trillion yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgagebacked security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies low interest rates  fears of deflation the bursting of the dotcom bubble a us recession and the us trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from  to  according to economist mark zandi the low yield of the safe us treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgagebacked cdos with their relatively highyields but credit ratings as high as the treasuries this search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase cdos though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating

mortgage hedge fund crisis around  as the cdo market continued to grow subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral by  mortgagebacked securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in cdos according to the financial crisis inquiry report the cdo became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain promoting an increase in demand for mortgagebacked securities without which lenders would have had less reason to push so hard to make nonprime loans cdos not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgagebacked securities they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities between  and  wall street issued almost  billion in cdos that included mortgagebacked securities as collateral despite this loss of diversification cdo tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so uncorrelated—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default the rise of ratings arbitrage—ie pooling lowrated tranches to make cdos—helped push sales of cdos to about  billion in  with a global cdo market of over usd  trillion cdo was the fastestgrowing sector of the structured finance market between  and  the number of cdo tranches issued in   was almost twice the number of tranches issued in   cdos like mortgagebacked securities were financed with debt enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course explanations for growthedit subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgagebacked securities mbs like cdos mbss were structured into tranches but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower levellowerrated mezzanine tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from aa to bb because most traditional mortgage investors are riskaverse either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices they are interested in buying the higherrated segments of the loan stack as a result those slices are easiest to sell the more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile the way mortgage securities are structured if you cannot find buyers for the lowerrated slices the rest of the pool cannot be sold to deal with the problem investment bankers recycled the mezzanine tranches selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—cdos though the pool that made up the cdo collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches most of the tranches  to  of the cdo were rated not bbb a etc but triple a the minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other cdos concentrating the lower rated tranches still further see chart on the theory of how the financial system created aaarated assets out of subprime mortgages as one journalist gretchen morgenson put it cdos became the perfect dumping ground for the lowrated slices wall street couldnt sell on its own other factors explaining the popularity of cdos include growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued a global savings glut leading to large capital inflows from abroad helped finance the housing boom keeping down us mortgage rates even after the federal reserve bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy supply generated by hefty fees the cdo industry earned according to one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in cdos as much as  to  percent of the cash flow generated by the assets in a cdo went to pay the bankers the cdo manager the rating agencies and others who took out fees rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the cdo tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by cdo issuers—earned extraordinary profits moodys investors service one of the two biggest rating agencies could earn as much as  to rate a mortgage pool with  million in assets versus the  in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size in  revenues from moodys structured finance division accounted for fully  of all moodys sales moodys operating margins were consistently over  making it one of the most profitable companies in existence—more profitable in terms of margins than exxon mobil or microsoft between the time moodys was spun off as a public company and february  its stock rose  trust in rating agencies cdo managers didnt always have to disclose what the securities contained because the contents of the cdo were subject to change but this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities investors werent so much buying a security they were buying a triplea rating according to business journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera financial innovations such as credit default swaps and synthetic cdo credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premiumlike payments making cdos appear to be virtually riskfree to investors synthetic cdos were cheaper and easier to create than original cash cdos synthetics referenced cash cdos replacing interest payments from mbs tranches with premiumlike payments from credit default swaps rather than providing funding for housing synthetic cdobuying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default if the cdo did not perform per contractual requirements one counterparty typically a large investment bank or hedge fund had to pay another as underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated subprime mortgages became less abundant synthetic cdos began to fill in for the original cash cdos because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically crashedit more than half of the highestrated aaa cdos were impaired losing principal or downgraded to junk status compared to a small fraction of similarly rated subprime and alta mortgagebacked securities source financial crisis inquiry report in the summer of  the caseshiller index of house prices peaked in california home prices had more than doubled since  and median house prices in los angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income to entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages down

common with those that made home purchases like this possible  expired mortgage payments skyrocketed refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices mezzanine tranches started to lose value in  by mid year aa tranches were worth only  cents on the dollar by october triplea tranches had started to fall regional diversification notwithstanding the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated big cdo arrangers like citigroup merrill lynch and ubs experienced some of the biggest losses as did financial guaranteers such as aig ambac mbia an early indicator of the crisis came in july  when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgagerelated securities by the end of   of cdo securities were downgraded and two highly leveraged bear stearns hedge funds holding mbss and cdos collapsed investors were informed by bear stearns that they would get little if any of their money back in october and november the ceos of merrill lynch and citigroup resigned after reporting multibilliondollar losses and cdo downgrades as the global market for cdos dried up the new issue pipeline for cdos slowed significantly and what cdo issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middlemarket or leveraged bank loans rather than home mortgage abs the cdo collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger mbs market depended on cdo purchases of mezzanine tranches while nonprime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages cdos were especially hard hit more than half   billion worth—of tranches issued in   and  rated most safe—triple a  by rating agencies were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by  in comparison only small fractions of triple a tranches of alta or subprime mortgagebacked securities suffered the same fate see impaired securities chart collateralized debt obligations cdos also made up over half  billion of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from  to early  criticismedit prior to the crisis a few academics analysts and investors such as warren buffett who famously disparaged cdos and other derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction carrying dangers that while now latent are potentially lethal and the imfs former chief economist raghuram rajan warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification cdos and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widelycitation needed during and after the crisis criticism of the cdo market was more vocal according to the radio documentary giant pool of money it was the strong demand for mbs and cdo that drove down home lending standards mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted the head of banking supervision and regulation at the federal reserve patrick parkinson termed the whole concept of abs cdos an abomination in december  journalists carrick mollenkamp and serena ng wrote of a cdo called norma created by merrill lynch at the behest of illinois hedge fund magnetar it was a tailormade bet on subprime mortgages that went too far janet tavakoli a chicago consultant who specializes in cdos said norma is a tangled hairball of risk when it came to market in march  any savvy investor would have thrown thisin the trash bin according to journalists bethany mclean and joe nocera no securities became more pervasive  or did more damage than collateralized debt obligations to create the great recession gretchen morgenson described the securities as a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages that created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders cdos prolonged the mania vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like citigroup and the american international group  in the first quarter of  alone credit rating agencies announced  downgrades of cdos at least some analysts complained the agencies overrelied on computer models with imprecise inputs failed to account adequately for large risks like a nationwide collapse of housing values and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up cdos would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated and when one mortgage defaulted many did affected by the same financial events they were strongly criticized by economist joseph stiglitz among others stiglitz considered the agencies one of the key culprits of the crisis that performed that alchemy that converted the securities from frated to arated the banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies according to morgenson the agencies had pretended to transform dross into gold as usual the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of wall streets rocket scientists fitch moodys and sp paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend accommodate and impress the wall street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay  their the rating agencies failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate michael lewis also pronounced the transformation of bbb tranches into  triple a cdos as dishonest artificial and the result of fat fees paid to rating agencies by goldman sachs and other wall street firms however if the collateral had been sufficient those ratings would have been correct according to the fdic synthetic cdos were criticized in particular because of the difficulties to judge and price the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly that adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lenders incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization according to economist mark zandi as shaky mortgages were combined diluting any problems into a larger pool the incentive for responsibility was undermined zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation finance companies werent subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks taxpayers werent on the hook if they went belly up precrisis only their shareholders and other creditors were finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards concept structures varietiesedit this section needs additional citations for verification

in structure and underlying assets but the basic principle is the same a cdo is a type of assetbacked security to create a cdo a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors a sequence in constructing a cdo is a special purpose entity spe is designedconstructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets common underlying assets held may include mortgagebacked securities commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans the spe issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets like other abs private label securities the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches each with different risk characteristics senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches losses are first borne by the equity tranches next by the junior tranches and finally by the senior tranches a common analogy compares the cash flow from the cdos portfolio of securities say mortgage payments from mortgagebacked bonds to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches then equity tranches if a large portion of the mortgages enter default there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first the risk and return for a cdo investor depends both on how the tranches are defined and on the underlying assets in particular the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches cdos like all assetbacked securities enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors thus investors must understand how the risk for cdos is calculated the issuer of the cdo typically an investment bank earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the cdo the ability to earn substantial fees from originating cdos coupled with the absence of any residual liability skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality in some cases the assets held by one cdo consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other cdos this explains why some cdos became entirely worthless as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasnt sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages many of which defaulted to trickle down to the equity layers structuresedit cdo refers to several different types of products the primary classifications are as follows source of funds—cash flow vs market value cash flow cdos pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the cdos assets cash flow cdos focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio market value cdos attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets the cdo asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the cdos portfolio there is greater focus on the changes in market value of the cdos assets market value cdos are longerestablished but less common than cash flow cdos motivation—arbitrage vs balance sheet arbitrage transactions cash flow and market value attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds the majority  of cdos are arbitragemotivated balance sheet transactions by contrast are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital a bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheets credit risk funding—cash vs synthetic cash cdos involve a portfolio of cash assets such as loans corporate bonds assetbacked securities or mortgagebacked securities ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle issuing the cdos tranches the risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority cash cdo issuance exceeded  billion in  synthetic cdos do not own cash assets like bonds or loans instead synthetic cdos gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps a derivatives instrument under such a swap the credit protection seller the cdo receives periodic cash payments called premiums in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event like a cash cdo the risk of loss on the cdos portfolio is divided into tranches losses will first affect the equity tranche next the junior tranches and finally the senior tranche each tranche receives a periodic payment the swap premium with the junior tranches offering higher premiums a synthetic cdo tranche may be either funded or unfunded under the swap agreements the cdo could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the cdos reference portfolio some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches typically the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing until a credit event occurs the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in highquality liquid assets or placed in a gic guaranteed investment contract account that offers a return that is a few basis points below libor the return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches when a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required the required payment is made from the gic or reserve account that holds the liquid investments in contrast senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower unlike a cash cdo investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the cdo when entering into the investment instead the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the cdo in the event the portfolios losses reach the senior tranche funded synthetic issuance exceeded  billion in  from an issuance perspective synthetic cdos take less time to create cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed and the cdos tranches can be precisely structured hybrid cdos have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash cdos—and swaps that give the cdo credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic cdo a portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps the cdo receives payments from three sources the return from the cash assets the gic or reserve account investments and the cdo premiums singletranche cdos the flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct single tranche cdos bespoke tranche cdos where the entire cdo is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models residual risk is deltahedged by the dealer structured operating companies unlike cdos which are terminating structures that typically winddown or refinance at the end of their financing term structured operating companies are permanently capitalized variants of cdos with an active management team and infrastructure they often issue term notes commercial paper andor auction rate securities depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company credit derivative products companies cdpc and structured investment vehicles siv are examples with cdpc taking risk synthetically and siv with predominantly cash exposure taxationedit the issuer of a cdo—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the united states to avoid being subject to us federal income taxation on its global income these corporations must restrict their activities to avoid us tax corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the us will be subject to federal taxation foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of us stock and debt securities are not investing unlike trading or dealing is not considered to be a trade or business regardless of its volume or frequency in addition a safe harbor protects cdo issuers that do trade actively in securities even though trading in securities technically is a business provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking lending or similar businesses cdos are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of cdos which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules such as pfic and cfc reporting the pfic and cfc reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax

companies mutual fund companies unit trusts investment trusts commercial banks investment banks pension fund managers private banking organizations other cdos and structured investment vehicles investors have different motivations for purchasing cdo securities depending on which tranche they select at the more senior levels of debt investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities eg corporate bonds of a similar rating in some cases investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing this is true because senior tranches pay a spread above libor despite their aaaratings investors also benefit from the diversification of the cdo portfolio the expertise of the asset manager and the credit support built into the transaction investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged nonrecourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities investors include hedge funds banks and wealthy individuals underwriteredit the underwriter of a cdo is typically an investment bank and acts as the structurer and arranger working with the asset management firm that selects the cdos portfolio the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches this includes selecting the debttoequity ratio sizing each tranche establishing coverage and collateral quality tests and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche the key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders such a determination requires estimating the afterdefault return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the cdos rated notes the excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive irrs to the equityholders other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle typically a trust incorporated in the cayman islands that will purchase the assets and issue the cdos tranches in addition the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the postclosing trading restrictions that will be included in the cdos transaction documents and other files the final step is to price the cdo ie set the coupons for each debt tranche and place the tranches with investors the priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches a bbb etc of the cdo it is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche in addition the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the cdo especially its more senior tranches according to thomson financial the top underwriters before september  were bear stearns merrill lynch wachovia citigroup deutsche bank and bank of america securities cdos are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved the underwriter is paid a fee when the cdo is issued the asset manageredit the asset manager plays a key role in each cdo transaction even after the cdo is issued an experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the cdos portfolio the manager can maintain the credit quality of a cdos portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur in theory the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below although in practice this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mids decade in addition it is now understood that the structural flaw in all assetbacked securities originators profit from loan volume not loan quality make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment the asset managers role begins in the months before a cdo is issued a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming cdo this process is called warehousing even by the issuance date the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the cdos portfolio a rampup period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the cdo is issued for this reason some senior cdo notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made when a transaction is
