semiconductor in klatencors backend semi packaging inspection system smt sq d aoi and metrology cybergage wafersense and reticlesense by its very nature is for the semiconductor vertical we have made great progress commercializing both of these technologies new products exciting differentiation higher speed accuracy for mrs and better yields and uptime with wafersense and reticlesense ssalong with

and inspections for things that could not be inspected by machine vision before so we are creating better yields for customers right now many of the high end smart phones and other high end consumer electronics that are being manufactured today  all of them are getting inspected with our proprietary mrs sensors and those things are enabling the quality of the products that we are already using right now sswhat about the latest developments within mrs sensor technologysk we are using digital projectors and digital cameras to enable the high accuracy and high speed what we continue to do is measure things that are smaller in feature sizes so right now the stuff that is commercial with mrs is more like  microns and above and in our lab we are beginning to do  micron type measurements and thats enabling new applications aside from mrs with the wafersense portfolio we continue to increase the number of applications so one of the products thats propelling our growth is the auto multi sensor which has leveling vibration and relative humidity measurement sensing so again we are increasing the number of applications we are coming out with thinner products so they can go into equipment where the load lock has a finer gap ssso even more benefits offered by cyberoptics so are there any applications in front end semiconductor for mrssk with next generation of mrs sensors we will be able to measure smaller features and once we are below  micron we will get into what we call the frontend inspection applications and that will open up a lot of new applications such as copper pillar tsvs interconnects and so on sshow about its potential use for coordinate measurementsk very recently we have enabled our d aoi system sq to not only do inspection but also do measurement in addition to inspection that enables our customers to do a lot more than just inspection and deciding whether its a pass or fail so certainly we are getting a lot of traction with the measurement capability its the first time any automated optical inspection aoi system at that speed can do not only inspection but measurements in addition to inspection sswhat can we expect in the futuresk we definitely expect to continue to grow the company given the technology platforms that we have both the wafersense and reticlesense platform and the mrs platform the company is doing great and our job is to accelerate the growth from where we are and service our customers with better products and better technologies ss wonderful well great news here from cyberoptics keep up the good work and all of

todays conference is being recorded at this time id like to turn the conference over to dr subodh kulkarni please go ahead subodh kulkarni thank you good afternoon and thanks for taking the time to participate in cyberoptics first quarter earnings conference call joining me is jeff bertelsen our cfo and chief operating officer who will review our operating results and some details following my overview of our recent performance we will then be available to answer your questions at the conclusion of our remarks in keeping with regulation fd we have made forwardlooking statements regarding our outlook in this afternoons earnings release these forwardlooking statements reflect our outlook for future results which is subject to a number of risks that are discussed in our form k for the year ended december   and other filings with the securities and exchange commission we urge you to review these discussions of risk factors turning now to cyberoptics recent performance our first quarter results which were consistent with our previouslyissued guidance for this period reflects the timing of orders and acceptances for our d mrsenabled systems as well as the difficult comparison with last years strong first quarter first quarter sales totaled  million compared to  million in first quarter of  revenue in last years first quarter was particularly strong driven by  million order of mx memory module inspection systems and a followon order of  million for sq d mrsenabled automated optical inspection or aoi systems and robust orders for legacy and d mrsenabled sensors we reported a net loss of  or  per share in the first quarter of  compared to earnings of  million or  per diluted share in the earlier period order activity for our portfolio of sq d aoi system products was solid in the first quarter and were particularly encouraged by our growing pipeline of opportunities of large projects involving multiple sq systems we believe some of these opportunities will generate significant revenues in the second quarter as a result were reaffirming our previous guidance calling for second quarter sales of  million to  million our growing pipeline of sq opportunities is driven by the competitive advantages of cyberoptics disruptive d mrs technology platform which is enabling the company to capitalize upon the growing demand for highprecision inspection for this reason we believe we can drive cyberoptics percentage share of the rapidly growing worldwide d aoi market into the low double digits in  the second quarter and fullyear outlook for d mrsenabled sensors is also promising sales generated by our longterm supply agreement with klatencor are expected to grow strongly as our d sensors are now becoming standard on klatencor backend semiconductor inspection systems utilizing d optical inspection were also optimistic about the second quarter outlook for our legacy d laseralign sensors for traditional oem customers although we continue to work with the consumer electronics company weve no visibility as to whether or not a new order will be forthcoming for this reason were not factored any orders from this customer into our second quarter and fullyear  for cash as previously reported weve made continued progress at advancing our mrsenabled d sensor technology features of  microns including devices with mirrorlike finishes are being measured consistently in the research lab and progress has been made toward measuring sub micron features this progress is essential for making mrsenabled d sensor technology applicable to midend semiconductor inspection within two years and frontend inspection within four years if this initiative proves to be commercially viable the available market opportunity for cyberoptics could be significant first quarter sales of semiconductor products primarily the wafersensereticlesense product line rose  yearoveryear in response to customer demand were developing additional product offerings to address other applications in semiconductor fabs and flat panel display manufacturing we anticipate strong future sales growth for our wafersensereticlesense product portfolio based upon positive feedback from customer demonstrations and evaluations in such diverse areas as d printing medical devices and cell phone components we remain confident that our recently introduced cybergage d scanning system should become an important contributor to cyberoptics’ longterm sales growth toward this end were continuing to strengthen our cybergage sales channel and demonstrate the system at key industry tradeshows consistent with previous statements that potential customers are taking longer than initially anticipated to evaluate the functionality and benefits of this general metrology inspection system no cybergage sales were recorded in the first quarter given the length of the evaluation and sales cycle were forecasting nominal cybergage sales in the second quarter and steadily increasing sales growth during the latter stages of  looking ahead the majority of our first quarterend backlog of  million is expected to ship in the second quarter and we have a promising pipeline of sales prospects for our sq d aoi products as a result were forecasting sales of  million to  million and a strong earnings rebound for the second quarter of  moreover we believe the phase momentum for our d mrsenabled systems and sensors and suite of semiconductor products should continue building momentum towards the second half for this reasons were optimistic that  should be another year of solid growth and profitability thank you now jeff bertelsen will review our first quarter operating results in greater detail jeff bertelsen thanks subodh to put a review of the sales performance of our product lines into context it should be reiterated that our first quarter revenue reflects the timing of orders and acceptances for d mrsenabled systems as well as the difficult comparison with last years strong first quarter but despite the first quarter softness that we forecasted previously we believe  will be another year of solid growth and profitability sales of inspection systems totaled  million in the first quarter down from  million in the first quarter the last year the first quarter of  included a large  million follow on order for sq d aoi systems and  million of mx revenue as subodh noted our order activity for our portfolio of d aoi system products was solid in the first quarter and we have a growing pipeline of opportunities for large projects involving multiple sq systems as a result we anticipate strongly improved system sales in this years second quarter both yearoveryear and sequentially sales of electronic assembly sensors totaled  million in the first quarter down from  million in the first quarter last year sales of both legacy and mrs sensors to our oem partners were particularly strong in the first quarter of  order activity for d sensors is strengthening and we are optimistic about the second quarter outlook for legacy d sensors given these factors we are forecasting strongly improved sensor sales in the second quarter of  on a sequential quarterly basis although modestly below the level posted in the second quarter of  sales of semiconductor products primarily the wafersensereticlesense product line totaled  million in the first quarter up  from  million in the first quarter last year the wafersensereticlesense product line is forecasted to post strongly improved second quarter sales on a sequential basis with sales at or near the level recorded in the second quarter of  finally sales of d scanners and scanning services totaled  million in the first quarter down from  million in the first quarter last year largely due to lower sales of xray systems we anticipate that second quarter  sales for d scanners and scanning services will be up significantly on a sequential basis but still down on a yearoveryear basis the second quarter of  included a large sale of xray systems to a single customer moving down to pl cyberoptics first quarter gross margin of  was up from  in the year earlier period primarily reflecting a more favorable product and geographic sales mix we believe that our gross margin percentage in the second quarter of  will be at or slightly above the first quarter level operating expenses totaled  million in the first quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter and  million in the first quarter of  higher sga expenses in the first quarter were mainly driven by cybergage sales and marketing initiatives and additional field sales engineers that were hired across our product lines to help drive sales sga expenses in the first quarter were slightly higher than originally anticipated due to the aforementioned additional hires and related recruitment fees cybergage marketing cost and higher channel commissions reflecting the mix of first quarter sale during the first quarter of  depreciation and amortization expense totaled  and stock compensation expense totaled  we believe second quarter operating expense will be at or near the first quarter level the  income tax benefit we have recorded in the first quarter of  includes a  excess tax benefits from stock option exercises excluding excess tax benefits the remaining income tax benefit in the quarter was booked at a  effective rate finally cash and marketable securities totaled  million at march   compared to  million at year end  the reduction in cash was due to payment of  accrued incentive compensation and to support additional inventory needed for forecasted second quarter revenue and future cybergage sale thank you ill now turn the call over the conference call operator who will poll you for any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from ash birla with dougherty please go ahead ash birla so decent quarter quick question can you jeff can you describe the sga  million how much of that portion is recruiting fees and audit fees in that just that is not recurring jeff bertelsen ash good question so i would say the recruiting fees were about  where audit fees in the first quarter they would be roughly in the  range as i mentioned those costs are a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated i think we started some of the hopes earlier than what we had anticipated we also spent some a little bit more money on some of the cybergage sales and marketing initiatives ash birla can you talk about cybergage pipeline one of the things is that you have talked about  customers  major customers can you update us with that pipeline subodh kulkarni sure ash as you know we are assuring the unit and more tradeshows just about every week or every other week right now so the pipeline continues to increase right now we are looking at more than  customer leads that we are generally following and what we call the hot customer leads have increased over  right now so those are the ones that are likely to purchase system in the near future so that increased with more tradeshows and so on ash birla and so obviously you havent  you said that youll not recognize revenue but can you at least provide how many cybergage units youve shipped subodh kulkarni so totally therere  units in the field right now many of them in various different tradeshows in different parts of the world some at least some at customers right now weve the ability  weve  more units been build in different stages right now so well ship them out in the next few months here and we obviously will ramp up depending on the actual orders we think different but its sufficient to do all the activities were doing right now ash birla okay and then just one last one just when you say solid growth is that  or  above gdp what is  can you just quantify that a little bit and how are you guys planning to achieve that because that would mean second half will probably grow   over first half subodh kulkarni so maybe i can take this question and jeff will chime in more shortly our fundamental reason we believe were going to have solid growth this year is because of the sq product line weve a very solid pipeline of opportunities and that ill try to quantify the opportunities for you that may give you a feel so weve about  large projects all related primarily to sq right now and the total value of the project comes to as much as about  million right now now not all of them and couple of them have started materializing already but not all of them have started yet and some of them may move out into  so its never quite clear but we believe a big fraction of that is going to materialize this year and that is going to be a primary growth driver for the company so because we had  mx revenues will come down this year as you know and maybe the ct revenues will come down but those  our negative offsets will be  there will be offset and more than that offset by sq pipeline right now which were getting at jeff bertelsen and so in addition to the sq pipeline which is the bigger driver ash as we mentioned in the release today were expecting mrs revenues to ramp up here as we become standard on the icos tool so thatll be a growth driver for us and were expecting cybergage sales to pick up in the latter half of the year so therere a number of drivers behind our second half growth in addition to wafersensereticlesense which… subodh kulkarni that will continue to grow jeff bertelsen which will continue to grow i guess the answer does the latter part of your question or maybe whats the first part of your question i mean we havent quantified our growth expectation for the full year we havent put a number on it other than just to say that we obviously do expect a strong second half and to have a good year here in  ash birla just one last one of the  million how much was the d mrs relative in revenue jeff bertelsen sure that was  million operator and well take our next question from jaeson schmidt with lake street capital markets jaeson schmidt i just want to start with opex i know it sounds like you guys continue to build out the cybergage sales channel and opex will remain relatively flat in q how should we think about any potential ramp and continued build out of that channel in the second half jeff bertelsen i mean i think in the second half we would expect us to see a little bit of opex ramp and thats really more tied to the revenue growth that were seeing and we do mainly sell through channel so therell be some third party commissions that would go with those sales we did add a few field sales engineers here in the first quarter and those mainly were added to support sales in the latter half of the year and were not talking about a big number i mean it was a small handful of people and we did spend more on cybergage marketing here in the first half in the back half of the year just the number of shows will go down so i think you know as we look in the back half i would see a little bit of increase in the opex mainly just driven by the higher revenue levels but not a big increase not a big increase in the number of headcounts or that type of thing jaeson schmidt and can you help us try figuring out where you currently are in your ramp with kla and when you think that will be fully ramped jeff bertelsen sure the equipment that they are shipping now most of the new stuff that theyre beginning to ship now is built in with our sensors today but there are older platforms that theyre trying to adapt us inside those so id say the other halfly in the ramp right now roughly speaking and the ramp will be pretty much complete we believe by the end of this year so  we expect to be on all their tools that need optical inspection jaeson schmidt okay and then last one from me and ill jump back in the queue looking at gross margin how should we think about the drivers there is it mainly just going to be revenue and mix jeff bertelsen well i think that the driver there will be the mrs products and the wafersensereticlesense products i mean those products tend to have higher gross margins and as we commented those will become a  those become a bigger percentage of our overall revenue mix we hope to see gross margins creep up here as time moves on and so were looking for a little bit of gross margin improvement here in the second quarter subodh kulkarni but its going to be a gradual move its not going to be a quick jump off jeff bertelsen exactly it will be a kind of a slow gradual increase operator operator instructions well take our next question from greg holme with greg holme capital group please go ahead greg holme i wanted to first piggyback on a previous question on the pipeline as it relates to the sq i think youve mentioned if i heard you right  large projects as much as  million anyway to sort of compare that to where we were maybe a year ago or even last quarter just kind of curious how that pipeline is you know evolved here overtime subodh kulkarni certainly compare to a year ago greg the number is a lot bigger i don’t know the exact number we were involved in at this time last year but its nowhere close to  projects and  million type number significantly smaller i would say at that time i don’t know exactly what it was three months ago but definitely smaller than what it is right now every month we are securing more wins and then that number continues to increase but its hard to know exactly there about three months ago jeff bertelsen i was just going to add and i would tag onto that i think our pipeline of opportunities is firming up to as we move forward so we are getting better visibility and that’s allowing us to quantify the opportunities better so some of the large projects that we were seeing a couple of months ago are materializing or getting better visibility greg holme and i guess sort of where i am going with it is whats  if you put a number on unless it was maybe  million or  million a year ago how much of that would you have realized overtime so i am trying to get a sense of that  million how much do you expect to realize this year versus next versus loose i mean i think you said something like a major fraction but anyway to sort of quantify whether that’s half of the  or three fourth of it jeff bertelsen sure so greg actually its not press release we have tried to  actually we have quantified a little bit and what we have said is the total d aoi market this year is going to be about  million globally and we expect to be lowdouble digit market share so that would just the math would say we would be close to  million to  million this year somewhere in that neighborhood okay now certainly if more projects materialize number will be higher and the assets will be lower but last years for reference in  we sold  million of sq so we are expecting this q more than double this year greg holme in terms of the pipeline how many of these  large projects are with new customers versus previous customers and is most of the activity still within consumer electronics or anything sort of outside that’s becoming more significant jeff bertelsen broad based there are three sets of customers if you think of it that way there is the traditional smt type customers like auto industry and just traditional electronics manufacturing an increasing number of second category is semiconductor companies we seem to be getting a lot of traction with the semiconductor companies and the third and the interesting area we seem to be getting into is companies that are interested in measuring things using d automated optical inspection substance and some of them are semiconductor somewhat smt but its almost a different kind of applications and sq because of the modest technology is really well suited to do sophisticated measurements in addition to inspections so i will say most of them are new customers there is probably two or three i am looking at the list here in front of me who have bought things almost in the past but most of them are new many of them are fortune  type companies so very good quality customers to have long term so we feel very good about the overall pipeline and numbers the size and thats why were so bullish about second half and our future greg holme one last one on systems just before we shift gears on the memories module side of things any sort of update there the one major customer last year but anything new going on in that area subodh kulkarni sure so the one customer who is nicely populated most of them nicely populated we do believe they may order a couple of more systems for maybe a  million or so sometime in the second half of this year but thats uncertain right now but the big opportunity were dealing with is one of their larger competitors but therere large companies in the memory industry we have one already with mx so were looking with another large one right now and clearly we understand that our system is far superior in performance compared to what they have today and theyre going through the internal roi justification whether to basically junk the systems that they bought three to four years ago and buy new mx mrs continue to operate being efficient systems so thats their decision obviously but were pretty confident based on the fact that theyre talking to us and they want us to do move the more devices and stuff like that that sometime in the next  months we can say itll be a  project because these things take time but sometime in the next  months we do expect another large mx customer to sign up and some large orders to follow through after that thats a big one in addition were talking of two second tier companies like kingston and pny and those kind of companies who are interested in mxtype product and one of the more interesting things weve done is weve enabled a d  mx at the end of the day uses d aoi technology and weve launched a product last year that we call qx which is also a d aoi technology so same technology as mx but it has a sensor on the top and sensor on the bottom and effectively it is a lower cost version of mx for people who dont have significant automation in their factories so its very suitable for tier  type of customers so theres a good chance that instead of buying a complicated mx system which is very good for highend automated environment they may choose multiple qxs to meet their application so it may get booked overall in the systems area it may not just show up as mx we have reported as qx but overall we feel very good about the whole memory industry opportunity and what we can do for inspection certainly with d aoi like mx or qx as i said earlier but even longterm for the d aoi and all the opportunities that memory industry brings to us greg holme just switching gears here that large consumer electronics customer who placed the pilot over last year i think it was right around this time when you received that and i know you dont have perfect visibility but assuming you do receive an order with your expectation piece that youll get one here shortly or has something maybe changed in terms of the timeline shifting where that might sort of pushed out a little bit later than maybe what was initially done last year subodh kulkarni what we do know is that theyre using our sensors that we gave them last year as part of their manufacturing processes right now and collecting more data so they like the technology they like what the sensors are capable of doing and frankly i think theyre  based on the data theyre going to make their decisions in the next two weeks or two months and its just impossible for us to be in their position and know what exactly issues theyre having in their manufacturing process and how many sensors that is going to need as far as we are concerned and thats why we chose to basically take it off  take it out of our numbers for q and the rest of the year so our guidance that we are providing does not include anything from that customer if they obviously make a large order thats all additional to that greg holme got it okay last one from me on cybergage just curious any feedback since you made the improvement in the inspection accuracy i just kind of wanted to know i guess if youre planning on making any additional changes to the hardware or software side of that or is it kind of finally at an optimal spot and now the challenge is kind of figuring out the best way to gotomarket with it and sell some of these things subodh kulkarni certainly the majority of the challenge right now is finding the right customer to the right application so its mostly sales and marketing but having said that we continue to improve the hardware and software as youve touched on earlier and we have improved the accuracy that we did about three months ago we came down from  micron accuracy that we started in october of last year to about  micron accuracy right now but since then we have done some software changes and we introduced some soothing functions which make the images and the scans look visibly better it doesnt quite change the measurement numbers but it does make the image very visually appealing by suppressing some of the noisy data points so were doing some minor improvements as time goes along based on customer feedback and what we think is the right thing are the right things to do so we continue to improve but the majority of the challenge is sales and marketing right now operator and well take our next question from miles jennings ph please go ahead unidentified analyst my question is regarding your apsrq and i realize that this was introduced some time ago but i cant thing to visualize what the trend in activity there is with these very large companies that would use in their lithographic scanning machine could you give us sort of the potential market there and where you stand as far as starting to capture some of that subodh kulkarni ill do my best here it is tough to call and you look at the size of the semi industry all the numbers are very large as were familiar miles so there are  to  active fabs worldwide right now and on an average i would say each fab has  to  lithographic stations if you will so you can multiply and then that would be the size and each lithographic station could use one apsrq and one amsrq that kind of stuff so you can multiply those numbers and average selling price for apsrq and amsrq is roughly  so they add up fairly quickly in terms of market size having said that i mean lithographic area is extremely sensitive to try and put it any foreigner object in that environment so we obviously have been selling apsrq and now amsrq frankly amsrq seems to be getting traction than apsrq from what we have seen so far primarily because humidity is something humidity measurement is something the lithographic customers seem to want to do particles they definitely look at but the systems are so clean that its almost like an insurance check that they are looking in particle whereas humidity they actually want to measure so within that amsrq fixed were getting better attraction than apsrq but both numbers are relative small compared to wafersense wafersense dominates our current numbers right now and this shows lithographic people may be more reluctant to inject new foreign things in their systems that expensive system normally a lithographic system cost anywhere from s million to the latest ub systems cost of  million and  million of fees i can only understand why lithographic engineers are really very reluctant to change anything or inject new foreign object in their system does that help unidentified analyst yes it does thanks i had just one further question sometime ago you introduced a new version of the sq which was i think call the ultra it basically is the same as sq but perhaps it was really more accurate and i just wondered in these large projects is some of that ultra or is it all mostly the original sq subodh kulkarni no there is both i mean some of the large projects are definitely related to the ultra so its just we select  we quantify a regular sq that resolution is what we call substance micron its actually  micron and ultra high resolution the resolution is  micron so it’s almost a  improvement over the regular sq to reresolution in d as you can imagine and definitely some of the large projects that we touched on earlier the  or so projects are because of the ultra high resolution system that we have available now but majority is still the regular sq unidentified analyst excellent i find it very interesting that how you expressed your answer in terms of percentage going down from  micron truly that’s pretty amazing thanks very much operator and we will take our next question from indiscernible with western international securities unidentified analyst i was curious any  customers in the quarter jeff bertelsen just hang on for a sec  there were  yes there was  customer in the quarter unidentified analyst and approximately what percent was that jeff bertelsen that percent roughly would be above   unidentified analyst a little bit clarity on the cybergage you previously mentioned that there were  units of leads that were being shown around and another  that were in under construction in the k it was mentioned that i think only two units were sold last year and presently the press release there were zero units sold in the most previous quarter are those just demonstration units or they actually built for customers jeff bertelsen the  units those are really demonstration units so they are used at tradeshows they are used at customer sites theyre rotate around and they will spend time at different customer sites but mainly for demonstration and evaluation right now there they certainly could be sold if the customer has won and wants to keep but we will sell that as well unidentified analyst and of the backlog of the  million backlog or is any of that related to the cybergage jeff bertelsen no not right now unidentified analyst and how much of the backlog youd mention that strong order activity for the sq during the quarter how much of the backlog is related to the sq jeff bertelsen so the sq backlog is roughly about a  million operator and it appears there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the conference back over to dr kulkarni for any additional or closing remarks subodh kulkarni so thank you for your questions and interest in cyberoptics we look forward to updating you with our q results in july thank you operator
