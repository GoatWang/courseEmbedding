requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii services have been rendered iii the fee is fixed or is determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria iii and iv are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the services delivered and the collectability of those amounts the company’s agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided as such the agreements are accounted for as service contracts revenues from the services rendered are recognized in proportion to the services delivered any amount receivable or received but unrecognized for revenue recognition purpose is recorded as deferred revenues sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities where applicable are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the statements of operations stockbased compensation   asc  compensation – stock compensation prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all sharebased payment transactions in which employee services are acquired transactions include incurring liabilities or issuing or offering to issue shares options and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  equity – based payments to nonemployees  measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued  the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date  sharebased expense totaled  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that the company would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in a timely transaction with an independent counterparty in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the investment or liability  a threetier hierarchy is established to distinguish between  inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and  inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs and establishes a classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes    the hierarchy is summarized in the three broad levels listed below     level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   level   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities interest rates credit risk etc   level   significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities    table of contents in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  the company’s debt derivative liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are level  measurements in the threetier fair value hierarchy    there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the periods ended march   and  fair value of financial instruments the companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash accounts payable and accrued expenses and debt  the carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the shortterm maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments   the following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at march   and december   measured at fair value on a recurring basis    march   level    level    level    total   assets                 none                         liabilities                                 derivative liabilities                                                           december   level    level    level    total   assets                                 none                         liabilities                                 derivative liabilities                         convertible notes convertible notes are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability component and an equity component the component parts of compound instruments are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement at the date of issue the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar nonconvertible instrument this amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date the equity component is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole this is recognized as additional paidin capital and included in equity net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured after initial measurement they are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method   derivative financial instruments the fair value of an embedded conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price protection reset provision features are deemed to be “downround protection” and therefore do not meet the scope exception for treatment as a derivative under asc   “derivatives and hedging” since “downround protection” is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion option and warrants and cannot be considered “indexed to the company’s own stock” which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under asc    the accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date any change in fair value is recorded as nonoperating noncash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date the company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date if the classification changes as a result of events during the period the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification the blackscholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the conversion options the model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates the expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time of other comparative securities equal to the weighted average life of the options   conversion options are recorded as debt discount and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument   recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued asu  “ revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing ” which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance the effective date for asu  is the same as the effective date of asu  as   amended by asu   for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those years the company has not yet determined the impact of asu  on its condensed consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued asu no  “compensation – stock compensation or asu no ” the areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows for public entities the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized minimum statutory withholding requirements forfeitures and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively an entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu no  on our condensed consolidated financial statements    table of contents in march  the fasb issued asu  “ revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent asu  clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services the effective date for asu  is the same as the effective date of asu  as   amended by asu   for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those years the company has not yet determined the impact of asu  on its condensed consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu no  “leases topic ” to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements topic  affects any entity that enters into a lease with some specified scope exemptions the guidance in this update supersedes topic  leases the core principle of topic  is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for public companies the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu no  on our condensed consolidated financial statements in january  the fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires among other things that entities measure equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings under the standard entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive income for equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated however subject to certain exceptions entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment and plus or minus adjustments for observable price changes with all such changes recognized in earnings this new standard does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans the standard is effective for us on july   the third quarter of our  fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements   note  property and equipment       property and equipment

associated risks related to these policies are discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported or expected financial results   in the ordinary course of business we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   the material estimates for our company are that of the stockbased compensation recorded for options and warrants issue and the fair of embedded conversion options that are convertible into a variable amount of shares and the income tax valuation allowance recorded for deferred tax assets the fair values of options warrants and embedded conversion options are determined using the blackscholes option pricing model we have no historical data on the accuracy of these estimates the estimated sensitivity to change is related to the various variables of the blackscholes option pricing model stated below the specific quantitative variables are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the estimated fair value of options is recognized as expense on the straightline basis over the options’ vesting periods the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model with the expected life dividend yield expected volatility and riskfree interest rate weightedaverage assumptions used for options and warrants granted expected volatility for  and  was estimated using the average historical volatility of three public companies offering services similar to ours the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date the expected life of options is based on the life of the instrument on grant date   basis of accounting and going concern   our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with gaap in addition the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business we generated accumulated losses of approximately  million through march   and have insufficient working capital and cash flows to support operations these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty   revenue and expense recognition   we recognize revenue when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or readily determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  “revenue recognition” determination of criteria iii and iv are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the services delivered and the collectability of those amounts the company’s agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided as such the agreements are accounted for as service contracts   revenues from the services rendered are recognized in proportion to the services delivered    table of contents any amount receivable or received but unrecognized for revenue recognition purpose is recorded as deferred revenues sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities where applicable are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the statements of operations stockbased compensation   asc  compensation – stock compensation prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all sharebased payment transactions in which employee services are acquired transactions include incurring liabilities or issuing or offering to issue shares options and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  equity – based payments to nonemployees  measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued  the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date  sharebased expense totaled  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively   convertible notes convertible notes are regarded as compound instruments  consisting of a liability component and an equity component the component parts of compound instruments are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement at the date of issue the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar nonconvertible instrument this amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date the equity component is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole this is recognized as additional paidin capital and included in equity net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured after initial measurement they are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method   derivative financial instruments   the fair value of an embedded conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price protection reset provision features are deemed to be “downround protection” and therefore do not meet the scope exception for treatment as a derivative under asc   “derivatives and hedging” since “downround protection” is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion option and warrants and cannot be considered “indexed to the company’s own stock” which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under asc  the accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date any change in fair value is recorded as nonoperating noncash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date the company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date if the classification changes as a result of events during the period the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification the blackscholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the conversion options the model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates the expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time of other comparative securities equal to the weighted average life of the options conversion options are recorded as debt discount and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument also refer note   significant accounting policies and note  – derivative liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that are included in this report   recent accounting pronouncements for discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements please see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein    table of contents item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   as a “smaller reporting company” we are not required to provide the information under item  item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as required by rule ab under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered by this report march   this evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer arend d verweij the certifying officer based upon that evaluation our certifying officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report march   our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in timely alerting management to material information relating to us and required to be included in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission the “commission”   our certifying officers further concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and are also ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow time for decisions regarding required disclosure based on the evaluation described above our certifying officers have concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because we did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient complement of accounting personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and there was an inadequate segregation of duties we expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in us gaap there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs due to the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there were no changes in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the three months ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably
