stock information investors faqs request information our focus unprecedented viral protection at chimerix we’re on a mission to discover develop and commercialize muchneeded medicines that improve outcomes for immunocompromised patients for people with weakened immune systems and patients undergoing bone marrow transplants common viruses can quickly become lifethreatening more than  hematopoietic cell transplants hct or bone marrow transplants are performed each year worldwide most frequently to treat patients with certain cancers of the blood and bone marrow or to address genetic diseases due to chemotherapy and the immune suppression associated with hct patients are highly susceptible to viral bacterial and fungal infections these complications are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the months following the transplant and too often the high risk of infection in the first year after transplant results in patients and their families deciding against having a potentially curative transplant our goal is to develop safe and effective therapies to protect these patients from the dangers of lifethreatening infections so they can remain on the path to recovery expand the links below to see more detail about the viruses that we are currently targeting expand all collapse all cytomegalovirus cmv cytomegalovirus cmv is a member of the herpesvirus family and remains a significant cause of viral infections in transplant recipients a majority of adults in the us have evidence of a prior infection with cmv which establishes a dormant or latent infection that cannot be cleared most individuals have an immune system that is able to prevent cmv from reactivating and causing disease in individuals with weakened immune systems—such as transplant recipients—cmv commonly reactivates during the first weeks following the transplant this leads to infection of the lungs or other organ systems and can increase the risk of other viral bacterial and fungal infections currently no therapies are approved for the prevention of cmv in hematopoietic cell transplant hct recipients because of known toxicities associated with available cmv antivirals including bone marrow suppression and renal impairment adenovirus adenovirus causes upper respiratory infections including the common cold in individuals with a functional immune system however in people with a weakened immune system such as patients who have undergone a transplant adenovirus can lead to lifethreatening infections including pneumonia and hepatitis disseminated adenovirus disease can be associated with a mortality rate of up to  in patients who are undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant hct also called bone marrow transplant currently no therapies are approved for the treatment of adenovirus smallpox smallpox is estimated to have killed more than one billion people worldwide prior to its eradication declared by the world health organization in  following a global vaccination campaign smallpox stocks remain for research purposes in the us and russia however undeclared stocks are suspected to exist routine smallpox vaccination programs were discontinued after the global eradication and with no antiviral agent approved for the treatment of smallpox the us population may be susceptible to a bioterror attack chimerix is working with the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda to develop a medical countermeasure to treat potential smallpox outbreaks in the event of bioterror attacks or accidental release technology that inspires drug development the ability to prevent lifethreatening viruses like cytomegalovirus cmv in vulnerable hematopoietic cell transplant hct recipients may be possible our proprietary technology has led us to two products currently showing great potential brincidofovir cmx and cmx brincidofovir a clinicalstage lipid conjugate nucleotide analog  has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against all five families of dna viruses that affect humans including cmv adenovirus bk virus and herpes simplex viruses in an orally administered dosing regimen cmx a novel lipid acyclic nucleoside phosphonate is active against hepatitis b virus hbv and more than fold more potent in vitro versus tenofovir against all major hiv subtypes resistant to current therapies through work to date we see
