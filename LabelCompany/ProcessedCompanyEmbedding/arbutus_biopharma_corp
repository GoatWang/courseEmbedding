profilesummaryrnpv is a method that materializes the value of a biopharma when it lies in its rd projectssumming up the rnpv and cash abus is undervaluedthe stock is highly volatile and still far from a stable investing perspectiveabout the rnpv model the value of a biotech can be laid on two main factors current marketed products and its pipeline the former can be easily measured in terms of cash generation capacity and valuated using simple ratios such as evtoebitda ratios or market cap over annual peak sales for the latter you only need market projections that may be made following a bottomup approach treatable population x estimated market penetration x annual cost per patient or top down total current market x estimated market penetration but what happens when there are no drugs currently sold in the market and all company’s value if any is obtained from its rd assets we need a model to assess clinicaltrialstage projects that considers not only the projected market but also success rates of clinical trials cost and time to market among others but why is this method superior than a traditional discounted cash flow because picking a discount rate when the risk drivers are not correctly identified makes it unreliable introducing clinicaltrial success rates as a payoff probability incorporates the main risk driver which enhances the valuation for further explanation of this methodology biotech valuations for the st century and putting a price to biotechnology from jeffrey j stewart is encouraged in this article i will be introducing and explaining the four general

to be delivered to the appropriate target cells abus has developed a proprietary delivery platform called lipid nanoparticle or lnp which is licensing to other companies partner programs alliances licensing agreements and research collaborations alnylam pharmaceuticals inc or alnylam has a license to use lnp technology to develop and commercialize products arbutus is entitled to lowtomid singledigit royalty based on sales performance top line data from the apollo clinical trial are expected in mid assuming a positive outcome new drug application nda filing for this program and marketing authorization application maa are expected by the end of  marqibo from spectrum pharmaceuticals is another partnered program that is giving abus mid singledigit royalty payments alexion pharma signed an agreement in which it would pay  million upfront and payments of up to m for an achievement of development as well as singledigit royalties for using lnp technology nowadays the main value of arbutus biopharma lies in its pipeline shown above moreover its three main clinical agents arb arb andab arbutus has been suffering a termination in many of its partnered programs as shown in its decline in revenue from m in  to m in  pipeline arb comprises three rnai triggers that target all four hbv transcripts and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce all viral antigen levels as well as ccdna and hbv dna arb is currently in phase ii management said that patients showed a consistent reduction in the hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag the multiple dose results from cohort  showed a significant reduction in hbsag in both cohort  and cohort  an additive reduction in hbsag was observed in each dose after  monthly doses of mgkg in cohort  was greater than that seen at  mgkg in cohort  demonstrating a doseresponse seen with repeat dosing the company is planning a fourth dose cohort for the year phase ii is expected to be finished by april  arb employs the same lnp formulation as arb with a different set of three rnai triggers that target all four hbv transcripts the arb phase ii multidosing study began dosing hbv patients early this year and data will be available in the second half of  it was significantly more potent than arb in preclinical studies and has the potential to be more effective at lower clinical doses than arb suppressing multiple elements of hbv including hbsag hbeag dna core antigen and all rnas including the hbx transcript management said in the earnings call that after the multidose study they will be informed to choose between these two candidates for further clinical development for the evidence shown i am only including arb in the model as background arbutus titled an oral presentation “exploring combination therapy for curing hbv preclinical studies with capsid inhibitor ab and a sirna agent arb” finally ab is a capsid inhibitor that blocks viral replication in the liver ab began a single and multiple dose study in healthy volunteers with single ascending dose cohorts followed by multiple ascending dose cohorts in the first quarter of this year it is expected to be included in studies with rnai in  as described in the last q “our product pipeline like our business is focused on finding a cure for chronic hbv infection with the objective of developing a combination of products that intervene at different points in the viral life cycle and reactivating the host immune system initially these combinations will include a single product from our pipeline combined with approved agents” therefore in our model we are assuming that only one final product is developed as a combination of ab and ab payoff probabilities for the readers that are following the formula shown in any of the two reports mentioned above is this ci is the cash flow at time i r is the current likelihood of reaching the final cash flow ri is the likelihood at time i of reaching the final cash flow rr is the current likelihood ie at time  of realizing the cash flow of time i and wacc is the discount rate when the author says “clinical drug development should be regarded as a series of highrisk wagers where success in the first wager eg a phase  trial allows a company to make additional wagers eg a phase  trial allows a company to make additional wagers eg phase  and  trials before reaching the ultimate payoff” it seems clear that each payoff of each trial should be preceded by the previous probability of success in the previous trial nonetheless the author uses a fraction to describe that probability why is that because he is using compound probabilities average success rates of reaching the market in every phase therefore the probability of passing every trial with the numbers provided assuming independence is obtained through these equations for example if we are currently in phase ii the likelihood of having a cash flow in phase iii is if it’s preferred to use probabilities of success in every phase instead of the numbers provided by jeffrey j stewart you can go to the data from clinical development success rates  the dataset includes probabilities classified by type of drugs other biologics such as rnai have these probabilities phase i to phase ii  phase ii to phase iii  phase iii to bla  bla to approval  costs jeffrey j stewart provides in his papers some inputs to deal with costs such as supporting animal studies number of clinical trial subjects per subject cost and filing costs in the fda he argues that “the cost of drug development can be estimated using industry standards and any deviations from these standards must be justified” however since abus is using its lnp technology costs are not easily comparable therefore the approach that i have followed selects from the total operating expenses the research development collaborations and contract expenses they “consist primarily of clinical and preclinical trial expenses personnel expenses consulting and third party expenses consumables and materials as well as a portion of stockbased compensation and general overhead costs” discarding the ga depreciation acquisition costs impairment of intangible assets and goodwill that i don’t think are incremental flows i believe this data is stable as the management says “setting aside intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges in q  q  and q  and acquisition costs in q  there has been a steady underlying increase in our expenses for the past eight quarters” finally i will interpolate a function using excel for the periods remaining i have assumed that arb will finish phase ii this year ab in the first half of  two and a half years of the recombined product and filing with the fda in  once the model gets the approval of the fda i will assume a  margin until the end of the patent eight years after  projected market since there is an unmet medical need for hbv there are several companies focusing on delivering therapeutics for treating this disease the company includes gilead sciences nasdaqgild johnson  johnson nysejnj assembly biosciences nasdaqasmb roche otcqxrhhby replicor spring bank nasdaqsbph alnylam nasdaqalny arrowhead nasdaqarwr contravir nasdaqctrv dicerna nasdaqdrna intellia nasdaqntla cocrystal otcqbcocp and enanta nasdaqenta here there is a complete list from hepatitis b foundation the most advanced phase for all of them is phase ii the same as arbutus in phase ii and pointed out by the above list of arbutus we find contravir replicor gilead roche and spring bank since we don’t have an extensive study available about safety effectiveness ease with which the products can be administered and so on and so forth i will assume a  market penetration each who estimates that in  there were  million people living with chronic hbv infection according to gbi research the market value for hbv will be  billion by  using our rough estimates the slice corresponding to arbutus would be  million chardan capital markets in a note to clients in april  estimated peak riskadjusted  sales at  million because “no other hbv drug class has demonstrated log hbsag suppression across multiple assets” while in july  estimated  million due to “new clinical competition from alnylam” peak riskadjusted sales are calculated by multiplying the market value times the final market share times the likelihood of having the drug marketed potential revenue numbers are usually provided by specialist biotech market intelligence companies whose reports are not usually affordable for the individual investor even a company with resources that can access a highquality information can suffer a great variability on its estimates  in the above numbers given the changes in the competitive landscape if we use  million and multiply by the payoff probability  we get  million which are far below the previous analysis guessing that i don’t have the best information i will use a middle range number  million cost of capital in “putting a price to technology” jeffrey j stewart assesses that “we assume here that the discount rate is equivalent to the  internal rate of return generally expected by the primary sources of capital available to biotechnology companies—venture capitalists and large pharmaceuticals companies” i am using this discount rate if the readers are interested in a further explanation i recommend reading this article complete evaluation the rnpv is somewhat above its current market cap  mm if we add its cash shortterm investments restricted investments and the royalty for a possible approval for partisan we get to a market cap of  representing a  potential return arbutus gross burn rate from the three months ending in  vs three months ending in  has been  month at march   the company had an aggregate of  million in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments as compared to an aggregate of  million in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments at december    after receiving the payment of  million from alexion and progress from the existing lnp license orders from alnylam and alexion it’s feasible that the company will extend its runway cash almost for a year and a half the downside although from a riskneutral perspective it seems to be a rational investment we need to remember that the rnpv model relies on uncertainty and subjective assumptions thus the procedure may become really arbitrary and consequently lead to totally wrong valuations moreover this is not the only possible valuation there are many others like real options the ultimate success of arbutus biopharma depends on taking its pipeline into the market rather than other licensing activities and arbutus has a bad track of failed assets the company used to trade at  finally many of its competitors have much greater financial technical and human resources than arbutus has at every stage of the discovery development manufacture and commercialization process independently of the success of arbutus i hope that at least one of these companies should be able to market a product that could improve the life of these  million people living with hbv disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article

nasdaqtkmr today announced plans to change its corporate name to arbutus biopharma corporation arbutus ticker symbol abus an industryleading therapeutic solutions company focused on developing a cure for chronic hepatitis b virus infection hbv to be effective on or before august   the name change affirms the successful integration of oncore biopharma and tekmira pharmaceuticals into a combined company with the singular goal of delivering a cure for chronic hbv the combined entity currently fields the largest portfolio of hbv product candidates in the industry and is led by an experienced and proven leadership team shown below with notable prior experience mark j murray phd president and ceo formerly of protiva zymogentics and xcyte therapeutics patrick t higgins chief business officer cofounder of oncore biopharma formerly of pharmasset and roche bruce cousins chief financial officer formerly of aspreva and johnson  johnson michael j sofia phd chief scientific officer cofounder of

pharmasset clinical development of sofosbuvir for hepatitis c and glaxosmithkline mark kowalski md chief medical officer formerly of gilead sciences ym biosciences and viventia biotechnologies peter lutwyche phd chief technology officer formerly of protiva qlt and inex pharmaceuticals we are very excited about the prospects for our integrated new company which has undergone a transformation to a complete hbv solutions company the company possesses exceptionally strong and proven clinical development scientific and commercial leadership teams and is very well resourced to execute against our goal of delivering a cure for chronic hbv we believe that the market opportunity for a curative regimen for hbv is very significant likely eclipsing the hcv market and presents a meaningful opportunity for shareholders said dr mark j murray president and ceo of tekmira we remain very confident in our potential to create value from our industryleading strategy team and pipeline dedicated to developing therapeutic solutions to cure hbv strategy for hbv development we believe the solution to hbv lies in combination therapies the development strategy of tekmira is to first establish safety and activity of individual product candidates followed by rapid progression to small cohort combination studies with multiple products to identify the most promising regimens a key feature of this strategy is the planned speed of evaluation of different combinations doses and treatment durations – a strategy previously used by this leadership team at pharmasset in developing sofosbuvir for hcv tekmiras broad pipeline of hbv product candidates which will be further expanded through business development activity will enable the company to rapidly advance the best product candidates and combination regimens and discontinue product development investment where it is no longer justified unique to our company is a commitment to a broad strategy and not to any individual product candidates our hbv pipeline currently consists of the product candidates shown in the chart that can be viewed by clicking the following link httpmediaglobenewswirecomcachefilepdf emerging science and advancing pipeline tekmira maintains a high level of activity in business development to evaluate additional assets that could be added to the companys pipeline as the understanding of chronic hbv evolves new targets and technologies are emerging as potentially promising approaches to treating hbv one example of this dynamic is a hypothesis that inhibition of plk could have utility in treating hbv as a result tekmira is planning to modify the clinical program for tkmplk to study the effect of plk on viral parameters in chronic hbv patients enrolled in the hcc trial tekmira is committed to having at least four hbv product candidates advancing in clinical development in h tekmira expects to file inds for three additional hbv product candidates in  a cccdna formation inhibitor a core protein inhibitor also known as capsid assembly inhibitor and a surface antigen secretion inhibitor new business unit for nonhbv assets and technology tekmira is also announcing the formation of a discrete business unit to manage develop and maximize the value of tekmiras nonhbv assets the division includes preclinical rnai product candidates ip and related know how of the lipid nanoparticle lnp delivery technology platform and multiple strategic partnerships exploiting the lnp technology the business unit will be independently financed and has a dedicated management team led by dr michael abrams managing director who was formerly ceo of anormed the development activities related to tkmebola will be suspended and a joint reevaluation of the development contract with the us department of defense is underway the management team of the new business unit will evaluate strategic alternatives for this asset nasdaq bell ringing and q financial results arbutus management will

officer awarded international society of antiviral research gertrude elion award vancouver british columbia and warminster pa may   globe newswire  arbutus biopharma corporation nasdaqabus an industryleading hepatitis b virus hbv therapeutic solutions company today presented results from preclinical studies of hbv drugs in three presentations at the th international conference on antiviral research icar held on may   in atlanta ga these presentations feature preclinical data from multiple arbutus pipeline programs that highlight the potential of arbutus therapeutic candidates to impair hbv viral functions and demonstrate additive to synergistic activity when combining arbutus assets with approved hbv therapies arbutus icar presentations “systematic in vitro evaluation of current and experimental hepatitis b therapeutics potential utility for combinations exploiting multiple and diverse mechanisms of action” by andrea cuconati director of virology in preclinical studies multiple clinical and preclinical arbutus direct acting antiviral agents tested in combination with nucleosidenucleotide analogues nas or interferon αa ifn standard of care therapeutics resulted in either additive or synergistic effects suppressing multiple elements of hbv including hbsag hbeag and hbv dna the results confirm the utility of arbutus’ agents in clinical combinations with standard of care  arbutus rnai agents arb and arb are currently in phase ii clinical testing in chronic hbv patients and ab a capsid assembly inhibitor is in phase i “activation of sting mediates antiviral effects in a mouse model of chronic hepatitis b” by emily thi principal scientist in vivo pharmacology and macromolecular discovery  in preclinical studies sting activation results in control of hbv repeated sting activation yielded cumulative reductions in hbv dna and hbcag across a day course of study type i ifn and cytokine induction may activate innate immune cells and t cell priming to potentially break hbv immune tolerance these findings provide proof of concept that targeting sting in chronic hbv infection may contribute to viral control and complement the immune modulatory programs underway at arbutus “viral hepatitis – the search for a cure” by dr mike sofia chief scientific officer               an introduction to the hbv landscape and an overview of the potential new therapies that may overcome the challenge of persistent chronic hbv infection and achieve a functional cure highlights from the studies presented our clinical assets arb ab and preclinical assets arb arb and arb when used in combination with the na and ifn’ standard of care demonstrate at least additive and in some cases synergistic antihbv activity preclinical capsid assembly inhibitors arb arb and arb show potent and highly selective inhibition of hbv replication arbutus expects to nominate a nd generation capsid assembly development candidate this year  these results continue to support

conjunction with icar dr michael j sofia arbutus’ chief scientific officer has been awarded the international society of antiviral research isar gertrude elion award for his outstanding contributions to the antiviral field through his development of a landmark hepatitis c virus hcv treatment “it is a great honor to receive the isar gertrude elion award for my work that led to the discovery of sofosbuvir which is the backbone of the curative standard of care for hcv arbutus is following a similar pathway by developing multiple therapeutic agents to achieve a cure for chronic hbv” said dr sofia “we are pleased to be presenting more encouraging data from our preclinical drug combination studies that support the utility of our proprietary hbv candidates in combination with the current standard of care we continue to employ a range of hbv models to examine the potential use and mechanistic complementarity of our hbv agents in these combination regimens arbutus has built a robust

momentumlinkedin profilesummaryrnpv is a method that materializes the value of a biopharma when it lies in its rd projectssumming up the rnpv and cash abus is undervaluedthe stock is highly volatile and still far from a stable investing perspectiveabout the rnpv model the value of a biotech can be laid on two main factors current marketed products and its pipeline the former can be easily measured in terms of cash generation capacity and valuated using simple ratios such as evtoebitda ratios or market cap over annual peak sales for the latter you only need market projections that may be made following a bottomup approach treatable population x estimated market penetration x annual cost per patient or top down total current market x estimated market penetration but what happens when there are no drugs currently sold in the market and all company’s value if any is obtained from its rd assets we need a model to assess clinicaltrialstage projects that considers not only the projected market but also success rates of clinical trials cost and time to market among others but why is this method superior than a traditional discounted cash flow because picking a discount rate when the risk drivers are not correctly identified makes it unreliable introducing clinicaltrial success rates as a payoff probability incorporates the main risk driver which enhances the valuation for further explanation of this methodology biotech valuations for the st century and putting a price to biotechnology from jeffrey j stewart is encouraged in this article i will be introducing and explaining the four general parameters that must be known to value clinical stage biotech stocks clinical success rates projected costs projected market and discount rate applying them to the concrete case of arbutus biopharma corp quick overview of arbutus biopharma corp and its pipeline abus is dedicated to discover develop and commercialize a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis b infection globally for achieving that it is developing a pipeline of drugs licensing its lnp technology and creating partnerships the company is using multiple hbvspecific technologies to cure the hb and targeting three pillars uncontrolled hbv replication within the body suppression of the host immune response and the inhibition of viral cccdna formation and elimination of the stable reservoir of viral ccdna its drug discovery and development plan is focused in rna interference rnai a mechanism that reduces the overproduction of specific proteins in order for rnai drugs to be applicable in the body they need to be delivered to the appropriate target cells abus has developed a proprietary delivery platform called lipid nanoparticle or lnp which is licensing to other companies partner programs alliances licensing agreements and research collaborations alnylam pharmaceuticals inc or alnylam has a license to use lnp technology to develop and commercialize products arbutus is entitled to lowtomid singledigit royalty based on sales performance top line data from the apollo clinical trial are expected in mid assuming a positive outcome new drug application nda filing for this program and marketing authorization application maa are expected by the end of  marqibo from spectrum pharmaceuticals is another partnered program that is giving abus mid singledigit royalty payments alexion pharma signed an agreement in which it would pay  million upfront and payments of up to m for an achievement of development as well as singledigit royalties for using lnp technology nowadays the main value of arbutus biopharma lies in its pipeline shown above moreover its three main clinical agents arb arb andab arbutus has been suffering a termination in many of its partnered programs as shown in its decline in revenue from m in  to m in  pipeline arb comprises three rnai triggers that target all four hbv transcripts and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce all viral antigen levels as well as ccdna and hbv dna arb is currently in phase ii management said that patients showed a consistent reduction in the hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag the multiple dose results from cohort  showed a significant reduction in hbsag in both cohort  and cohort  an additive reduction in hbsag was observed in each dose after  monthly doses of mgkg in cohort  was greater than that seen at  mgkg in cohort  demonstrating a doseresponse seen with repeat dosing the company is planning a fourth dose cohort for the year phase ii is expected to be finished by april  arb employs the same lnp formulation as arb with a different set of three rnai triggers that target all four hbv transcripts the arb phase ii multidosing study began dosing hbv patients early this year and data will be available in the second half of  it was significantly more potent than arb in preclinical studies and has the potential to be more effective at lower clinical doses than arb suppressing multiple elements of hbv including hbsag hbeag dna core antigen and all rnas including the hbx transcript management said in the earnings call that after the multidose study they will be informed to choose between these two candidates for further clinical development for the evidence shown i am only including arb in the model as background arbutus titled an oral presentation “exploring combination therapy for curing hbv preclinical studies with capsid inhibitor ab and a sirna agent arb” finally ab is a capsid inhibitor that blocks viral replication in the liver ab began a single and multiple dose study in healthy volunteers with single ascending dose cohorts followed by multiple ascending dose cohorts in the first quarter of this year it is expected to be included in studies with rnai in  as described in the last q “our product pipeline like our business is focused on finding a cure for chronic hbv infection with the objective of developing a combination of products that intervene at different points in the viral life cycle and reactivating the host immune system initially these combinations will include a single product from our pipeline combined with approved agents” therefore in our model we are assuming that only one final product is developed as a combination of ab and ab payoff probabilities for the readers that are following the formula shown in any of the two reports mentioned above is this ci is the cash flow at time i r is the current likelihood of reaching the final cash flow ri is the likelihood at time i of reaching the final cash flow rr is the current likelihood ie at time  of realizing the cash flow of time i and wacc is the discount rate when the author says “clinical drug development should be regarded as a series of highrisk wagers where success in the first wager eg a phase  trial allows a company to make additional wagers eg a phase  trial allows a company to make additional wagers eg phase  and  trials before reaching the ultimate payoff” it seems clear that each payoff of each trial should be preceded by the previous probability of success in the previous trial nonetheless the author uses a fraction to describe that probability why is that because he is using compound probabilities average success rates of reaching the market in every phase therefore the probability of passing every trial with the numbers provided assuming independence is obtained through these equations for example if we are currently in phase ii the likelihood of having a cash flow in phase iii is if it’s preferred to use probabilities of success in every phase instead of the numbers provided by jeffrey j stewart you can go to the data from clinical development success rates  the dataset includes probabilities classified by type of drugs other biologics such as rnai have these probabilities phase i to phase ii  phase ii to phase iii  phase iii to bla  bla to approval  costs jeffrey j stewart provides in his papers some inputs to deal with costs such as supporting animal studies number of clinical trial subjects per subject cost and filing costs in the fda he argues that “the cost of drug development can be estimated using industry standards and any deviations from these standards must be justified” however since abus is using its lnp technology costs are not easily comparable therefore the approach that i have followed selects from the total operating expenses the research development collaborations and contract expenses they “consist primarily of clinical and preclinical trial expenses personnel expenses consulting and third party expenses consumables and materials as well as a portion of stockbased compensation and general overhead costs” discarding the ga depreciation acquisition costs impairment of intangible assets and goodwill that i don’t think are incremental flows i believe this data is stable as the management says “setting aside intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges in q  q  and q  and acquisition costs in q  there has been a steady underlying increase in our expenses for the past eight quarters” finally i will interpolate a function using excel for the periods remaining i have assumed that arb will finish phase ii this year ab in the first half of  two and a half years of the recombined product and filing with the fda in  once the model gets the approval of the fda i will assume a  margin until the end of the patent eight years after  projected market since there is an unmet medical need for hbv there are several companies focusing on delivering therapeutics for treating this disease the company includes gilead sciences nasdaqgild johnson  johnson nysejnj assembly biosciences nasdaqasmb roche otcqxrhhby replicor spring bank nasdaqsbph alnylam nasdaqalny arrowhead nasdaqarwr contravir nasdaqctrv dicerna nasdaqdrna intellia nasdaqntla cocrystal otcqbcocp and enanta nasdaqenta here there is a complete list from hepatitis b foundation the most advanced phase for all of them is phase ii the same as arbutus in phase ii and pointed out by the above list of arbutus we find contravir replicor gilead roche and spring bank since we don’t have an extensive study available about safety effectiveness ease with which the products can be administered and so on and so forth i will assume a  market penetration each who estimates that in  there were  million people living with chronic hbv infection according to gbi research the market value for hbv will be  billion by  using our rough estimates the slice corresponding to arbutus would be  million chardan capital markets in a note to clients in april  estimated peak riskadjusted  sales at  million because “no other hbv drug class has demonstrated log hbsag suppression across multiple assets” while in july  estimated  million due to “new clinical competition from alnylam” peak riskadjusted sales are calculated by multiplying the market value times the final market share times the likelihood of having the drug marketed potential revenue numbers are usually provided by specialist biotech market intelligence companies whose reports are not usually affordable for the individual investor even a company with resources that can access a highquality information can suffer a great variability on its estimates  in the above numbers given the changes in the competitive landscape if we use  million and multiply by the payoff probability  we get  million which are far below the previous analysis guessing that i don’t have the best information i will use a middle range number  million cost of capital in “putting a price to technology” jeffrey j stewart assesses that “we assume here that the discount rate is equivalent to the  internal rate of return generally expected by the primary sources of capital available to biotechnology companies—venture capitalists and large pharmaceuticals companies” i am using this discount rate if the readers are interested in a further explanation i recommend reading this article complete evaluation the rnpv is somewhat above its current market cap  mm if we add its cash shortterm investments restricted investments and the royalty for a possible approval for partisan we get to a market cap of  representing a  potential return arbutus gross burn rate from the three months ending in  vs three months ending in  has been  month at march   the company had an aggregate of  million in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments as compared to an aggregate of  million in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted investments at december    after receiving the payment of  million from alexion and progress from the existing lnp license orders from alnylam and alexion it’s feasible that the company will extend its runway cash almost for a year and a half the downside although from a riskneutral perspective it seems to be a rational investment we need to remember that the rnpv model relies on uncertainty and subjective assumptions thus the procedure may become really arbitrary and consequently lead to totally wrong valuations moreover this is not the only possible valuation there are many others like real options the ultimate success of arbutus biopharma depends on taking its pipeline into the market rather than other licensing activities and arbutus has a bad track of failed assets the company used to trade at  finally many of its competitors have much greater financial technical and human resources than arbutus has at every stage of the discovery development manufacture and commercialization process independently of the success of arbutus i hope that at least one of these companies should be able to market a product that could improve the life of these  million people living with hbv disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article
