why invest in frontier markets the case for equity investing in frontier markets draws from multiple factors strong historical precedent the power of economic globalization the compelling diversification benefits demonstrated by frontier investments and the unbridled optimism and entrepreneurial spirit of the people who live and work in these countries why invest in frontier markets here are just a few reasons frontier markets are young the demographics of frontier market populations are tilted more toward the workforce than the retirement home as seen in developed and emerging markets these characteristics point to potential for productivity growth and expanding consumer classes  the stuff investment returns are made of frontier markets act differently stock market return patterns in frontier markets dont parallel those of the rest of the world in fact return patterns from country to country on the frontier show low correlation to each other providing investors excellent potential to diversify any portfolio economic development has proven a powerful return engine the ability of economic development to generate investment return has proven efficacious in the worlds emerging markets from the rapid growth of the asian tiger economies of the s to the advances in chile israel and brazil in the s to the ascent of china and india in more recent years frontier markets tread this same path to development life is getting better faster for people in frontier markets and this positive change is fueling optimism people in developed markets do not necessarily believe life will be better for themselves and their children in the future people in frontier markets have little doubt that their quality of life will improve and they are motivated to work hard to augment the change a flatter shrinking world is rapidly delivering benefits and opportunities to frontier markets many business owners workers and consumers in frontier markets will never know a landline phone or fax machine leapfrogging technology is bringing incredible depth of information and power to the shirt pockets and fingertips of emerging entrepreneurs on the frontier frontier

markets goes from improved productivity to economic growth to a higher standard of living and back to more improving productivity investors who provide patient capital to the cycle through disciplined approaches may achieve desirable outcomes in terms of both risk and reward unconstrained and disciplined investment opportunity in frontier markets may occur in any of five regions africa asia caribbeanlatin america eastern europe and the middle east and in more than 6 different markets transaction costs can run high liquidity conditions can be complex and business practices are anything but standard the ratio of participation between local and outside investors varies widely from country to country as a result the characteristics of individual markets and stocks are colored by marketspecific human behavior and trading nuances we add value through country analysis security analysis and portfolio construction we focus on businesses that are integrated to the development of frontier market consumers investment candidates must offer quality products and service and also have good growth prospects solid management and transparent accounting practices in this pursuit there is no substitute for direct contact with company managements field research and handson confirmation there is no standard form of analysis sometimes the greatest opportunities lie in places that are far from comfort but have the potential for sweeping change our passports bear stamps documenting frequent travel to some of the worlds least developed but most interesting locations likewise our research dossiers bulge with customized financial analyses interview notes and qualitative reporting source material all of this is essential to an investment strategy that seeks the best opportunities not the emulation of a benchmark our strictly opportunistic style means we wont drift into emerging or developed market stocks when more challenging conditions arise with more than  years of experience in researching and analyzing the global marketplace and identifying growth trends and market opportunities as well as more than a decade of exclusive frontier markets focus we

dutifully follow core tenets and apply rigorous disciplines we believe value provides protection and profit in frontier stock markets value must be complemented by sound businesses  we look for
