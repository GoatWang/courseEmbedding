opportunities said dr scott rickert ceo of pen inc dr richard fink president of applied nanotech noted our team has over  years of experience and knowhow in the field including our us patent no  that describes the application of graphene in the form of carbon flakesthe companys graphene stripper foils can overcome critical limitations of alternative materials due to their exceptional physical properties such as mechanical strength uniformity and high thermal conductivity tests performed on an accelerator at michigan state university show that the lifetime of these foils are two to four times longer than those of currently available amorphous carbon foils the graphene foils can be made as large as  cm about  inches in diameter and can be easily cut into smaller sections to meet the requirements of various types of equipment used to manufacture imaging biomarkersafter using applied nanotechs foils in our cyclotron for the last several months we are impressed with their

number of pages  shelf life cartridge type genuine or oem original cartridges remanufactured cartridges compatible cartridges description oem stands for original equipment manufacturer meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use after use the cartridge is recycled acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process during the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality its then carefully refilled tested again and brought back to life buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill a compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer its like buying the generic version of the genuine brand most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges despite any structural difference you may notice the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield just like the original brand price factors many printer manufacturers follow the razorandblades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink its far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new oem from scratch compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand compatible suppliers dont have to worry about the additional costs that hinder oems like new printers or firmware which lets them keep prices low quality original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer high quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original but not all remanufactured ink is created equal make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results high quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original but not all compatible ink is created equal make sure you buy from a reputable

number of pages  shelf life cartridge type genuine or oem original cartridges remanufactured cartridges compatible cartridges description oem stands for original equipment manufacturer meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use after use the cartridge is recycled acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process during the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality its then carefully refilled tested again and brought back to life buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill a compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer its like buying the generic version of the genuine brand most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges despite any structural difference you may notice the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield just like the original brand price factors many printer manufacturers follow the razorandblades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink its far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new oem from scratch compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand compatible suppliers dont have to worry about the additional costs that hinder oems like new printers or firmware which lets them keep prices low quality original cartridges work extremely well and are covered
