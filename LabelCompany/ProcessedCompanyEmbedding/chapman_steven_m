become the forefront of christian music as an industry nearly every artist has left his or her mark on it over the years contributing to a rich tapestry of musical expression all aimed at directly praising god—either as individuals or as a corporate body but it’s a genre steven curtis chapman who has earned more awards than any single recording artist in christian music history has never contributed to—until now worship and believe marks the first worship album by the time dove awardwinning artist who has sold nearly eleven million albums in his three decadelong career of creating music the  studio tracks and six live tracks recorded at oak hills church in san antonio texas form a theologically thoughtful collection designed for verticallyfocused praise and worship lyrically worship and believe presents ten core truths from scripture as “proclamations of truth that we can declare together” chapman says coproduced with chapman’s longtime producer and friend brent milligan worship and believe is chapman’s rd career album and serves as a musical worship companion to the believe curriculum a week church curriculum written by one of oak hills’ pastors senior ministerrandy frazee as a followup to the  bestselling project the story believe is a resource designed to help churches engage the bible while on tour with the story frazee began to share with chapman about the believe curriculum and believed chapman was the perfect fit to oversee the musical backdrop as randy talked about how important it is for us as the church to know what we believe and why i began to get excited thinking ‘i want to write those songs create those musical declarations that we as the church can sing together” he enlisted the cowriting help of several established worship artists and songwriters like matt maher matt redman and chris tomlin whom chapman refers to tongueincheek as the “real worship professionals” while chapman had never felt the impetus to record a worship album until now he recognized his unique vantage point when writing “i thought maybe i could be a guy who is not in a particular worship camp community” he says “i’m not a passion artist or bethel artist or gateway i thought ‘what if i were to bring all those different communities together musically in a way to create this project” worship and believe combines these influences and those from years past from artists like rich mullins and wes king to create a classic collection that appeals to the diverse audience of church bodies today “for me some of the greatest worship music maybe wasn’t even called worship music at the time” he says “rich mullins’ ‘step by step’ is probably the song i sung before i even knew what those songs were called i would do it in concert just because i love singing that song and so many of his like ‘awesome god’ if i’m going to make this kind of music i want it to draw on some of the influences that have most inspired me scripture and worship music have been lifelines for chapman during the past several years as his family has grieved the loss of his youngest daughter maria in an accident on may   what sustained him was proclaiming truth “really out of desperation what came to my heart and my lips was ‘blessed be the name of the lord you give and take away’ and i just kept saying it i kept singing it and whispering it i’d go where nobody could hear me and i screamed it until i didn’t have a voice left and every time i did it was like i would feel something pull me back a little bit from that abyss and i’d have a little more oxygen in my lungs to say it again it was like the only clarity i had would come when i would say ‘god i’m going to bless your name you give and youtake away i’m going to trust you “blessed be the name of the lord” written by his friend matt redman was sung as redman led worship at the fiveyearold’s funeral the song continues to be prominent with the chapman family in the loss and in the celebration of their daughter’s life and for the following two years any time chapman took the stage he began with that song “i would just drive a stake in the ground and say ‘god this is what’s most true the pain is true the questions are real the grief is real the anger is real but what’s most real and what’s most true is that you are god you’re faithful’” it’s from that place of suffering and surrender chapman began to write songs to illuminate promises of god and declare truths from scripture from the anthemic “we believe” to the tender “hallelujah you are good” to the triumphant “king of love” and hopeful “god of forever” these songs mark a new season for chapman — creating more vertically focused worship songs spurred on by a soul awakening to worship music he experienced as he held fast to songs of the church through a season of loss “these songs have come out of my own journey particularly of the last seven years of learning the lifegiving power of hearing my own voice and the voice of other believers around me declare what is most true and most real” he says “what god says is true — even when pain doubt grief and confusion are very real as well there’s an incredible power in agreeing with each other and especially with god” worship and believe is both a call to and celebration of unity as christians rally around who and what we worship and believe declaring it together as
