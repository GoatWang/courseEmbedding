currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make quarterly distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries that will enable the carlyle group lp to pay a quarterly distribution of  per common unit for each of the first three quarters of each year and for the fourth quarter of each year to pay a distribution of at least  per common unit that taken together with the prior quarterly distributions in respect of that year represents its share net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement of our distributable earnings in excess of the amount determined by our general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business to make        appropriate investments in our business and our funds or to comply with applicable law or any of our financing agreements we anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for most years will be less than our distributable earnings for that year due to these funding requirements for a more complete discussion see cash distribution policy     notwithstanding the foregoing the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner which may change our distribution policy at any time our general partner will take into account general economic and business conditions our strategic plans and

tax and regulatory restrictions other constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant     the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units in carlyle holdings held through whollyowned subsidiaries we intend to cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp in order to fund any distributions we may declare on the common units if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings because carlyle holdings i gp inc must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by the carlyle group lp to common unitholders are expected to be less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units     in addition the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships provide for cash distributions which we refer to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if our whollyowned subsidiaries that are the general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income the carlyle holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent        distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities the carlyle group lp is not required to distribute to its common unitholders any of the cash that its whollyowned subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions by the carlyle holdings partnerships for additional information including limitations on our ability to make distributions see cash distribution policy   exchange rights of holders of carlyle holdings partnership units we have entered into an exchange agreement with the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships including certain of our directors and executive officers so that these holders subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships may on a quarterly basis subject to the terms of the exchange agreement exchange their carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units on a oneforone basis subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits unit distributions and reclassifications in addition subject to certain requirements mubadala has been generally permitted to exchange carlyle holdings partnerships units for common units following the first anniversary of the closing of the ipo a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit as the number of carlyle holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships declines the number of votes to which tcg carlyle global partners llc is entitled as a result of its ownership of the special voting unit will be correspondingly reduced   tax receivable agreement exchanges of carlyle holdings partnership units for our common units that are executed by the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships and dispositions of carlyle holdings partnership units by such limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships to us or our whollyowned subsidiaries such as those to be effected in connection with this offering as described in use of proceeds result in transfers of and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business these transfers and increases in tax basis will increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that certain of our subsidiaries including carlyle holdings i gp inc which we refer to as the corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships whereby the corporate taxpayers have agreed to pay to such holders  of the amount of cash tax savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or foreign or franchise tax that they realize as a result of these increases        in tax basis and in limited cases transfers or prior increases in tax basis the corporate taxpayers expect to benefit from the remaining  of cash tax savings if any in income tax they realize payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine the corporate taxpayers will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if a tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the internal revenue service the corporate taxpayers have the right to terminate the tax receivable agreement by making payments to such holders calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that such holders would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement using certain valuation assumptions including that that the corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and that any carlyle holdings partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination     we expect to record a deferred tax asset of approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units for the estimated income tax effects based on certain assumptions and enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the transaction of the increase in the tax basis that we anticipate will result from our use of the portion of the net proceeds of this offering to purchase outstanding carlyle holdings partnership units from the holders thereof to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset based on an analysis of expected future earnings we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance we will record  of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as an increase to the liability due to such selling holders of carlyle holdings partnership units including certain of our directors and executive officers under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining  of the estimated realizable tax benefit will initially be recorded as an increase to partners capital see note  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in the annual report which is

approximately  million and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units we estimate the net proceeds to us will be approximately  million we intend to use the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of  common units approximately  million for general corporate purposes investments in our funds as well as including investment capital for acquisitions of new fund platforms and strategies or other growth initiatives to drive innovation across the broader carlyle platform we intend to use the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of  common units approximately  million or  common units approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units to purchase from certain holders including certain of our directors and executive officers an equivalent number of outstanding carlyle holdings partnership units the issuance of common units described in this paragraph will not have an impact on the number of outstanding common units on a fullyexchanged basis ie the number of common units that would be outstanding if all vested and unvested carlyle holdings partnership units other than those held by the carlyle group lp andor its whollyowned subsidiaries were exchanged for newlyissued common units on a oneforone basis of the approximately  million of net proceeds of this offering that will ultimately be paid to selling holders of carlyle holdings partnership units we expect that approximately  million will be paid to william e conway jr a founder and cochief executive officer and member of the board of directors of our general partner for  carlyle holdings partnership units or  million for  carlyle holdings partnership units if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units approximately  million will be paid to daniel a daniello a

the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units following this offering messrs conway and daniello together with david m rubenstein a founder and cochief executive officer will continue to be the largest individual owners of our firm immediately following this offering mr conway will continue to own  carlyle holdings partnership units representing a  ownership interest in our company and more than  of the carlyle holdings partnership units he originally received at the time of our ipo or  carlyle holdings partnership units representing a  ownership interest in our company and more than  of his original holdings if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units and mr daniello and his personal planning vehicles will continue to own  carlyle holdings partnership units representing a  ownership interest in our company and more than  of the carlyle holdings partnership units he originally received at the time of our ipo or  carlyle holdings partnership units representing a  ownership interest in our company and more than  of his original holdings if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase

commitments to our investment funds totaling  million as of the end of  or more than five times the proceeds that they will collectively indirectly receive in connection with this offering or more than four times the proceeds if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units as of the end of  the other professionals who are selling carlyle holdings partnership units to us or our whollyowned subsidiaries in connection with this offering had unfunded commitments to our investment funds totaling  million or more than  times the proceeds that such persons will collectively indirectly receive in connection with this offering or two times the proceeds if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units price range of common units the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per unit of our common units for the periods indicated        high      low          second quarter                 third quarter                 fourth quarter                        first quarter                 second quarter                 third quarter                 fourth quarter                        first quarter                    represents the high and low sales price for the period from may   the date our common units began trading through june    represents the high and low sales price for the period from january   through march      cash distribution policy we currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make quarterly distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries that will enable the carlyle group lp to pay a quarterly distribution of  per common unit for each of the first three quarters of each year and for the fourth quarter of each year to pay a distribution of at least  per common unit that taken together with the prior quarterly distributions in respect of that year represents its share net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement of carlyles distributable earnings in excess of the amount determined by carlyles general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of carlyles business to make appropriate investments in its business and its funds or to comply with applicable law or any of its financing agreements we anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for most years will be less than our distributable earnings for that year due to these funding requirements notwithstanding the foregoing the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner which may change our distribution policy at any time our general partner will take into account general economic and business conditions our strategic plans and prospects our business and investment opportunities our financial condition and operating results working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs contractual restrictions and obligations legal tax and regulatory restrictions other constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant because the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units in carlyle holdings held through whollyowned subsidiaries we will fund distributions by the carlyle group lp if any in three steps        first we will cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings        second we will cause the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries to distribute to the carlyle group lp their share of such distributions net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement by such whollyowned subsidiaries and        third the carlyle group lp will distribute its net share of such distributions to our common unitholders on a pro rata basis because our whollyowned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by us to our common unitholders are expected to be less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the other limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units in addition the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships will provide for cash distributions which we refer to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp which are the general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income the carlyle holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities the carlyle group lp is not required to distribute to its common unitholders any of the cash that its whollyowned subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions by the carlyle holdings partnerships    under the delaware limited partnership act we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of our assets if we were to make such an impermissible distribution any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years in addition the terms of our credit facility provide certain limits on our ability to make distributions please see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationliquidity and capital resources appearing in the annual report which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus for additional information regarding distributions to our common unitholders and the limited partners of carlyle holdings    conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities conflicts of interest conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between our general partner or its affiliates including each partys respective owners on the one hand and our partnership its subsidiaries or our limited partners on the other hand whenever a potential conflict arises between our general partner or its affiliates or associates on the one hand and us our subsidiaries or any other partner on the other hand our general partner will resolve that conflict our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to our common unitholders and the partnership at law or in equity accordingly our general partner is only subject to the contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement and to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing our partnership agreement also limits the liability of our general partner and restricts the remedies available to common unitholders for actions taken that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duties under our partnership agreement our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our common unitholders if the resolution of the conflict is        approved by the conflicts committee although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval        approved by the vote of a majority of the voting power of our voting units excluding any voting units owned by our general partner and any of its affiliates although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval or        approved by our general partner in good faith as determined under the partnership agreement our general partner may but is not required to seek the approval of such resolution from the conflicts committee or the holders of our voting units if our general partner does not seek approval from the conflicts committee or the holders of our voting units any resolution or course of action taken by it with respect to the conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed approved by us and our partners and not a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty including any fiduciary duties unless our general partner subjectively believes that the resolution or course of action is opposed to the best interests of the partnership in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us or any other person bound by the partnership agreement the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of providing that the general partner subjectively believed that such resolution or course of action was opposed to the best interests of the partnership unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our partnership agreement our general partner or the conflicts committee may consider any factors it determines in good faith to consider when resolving a conflict the three bullet points above establish the procedures by which conflict of interest situations are to be resolved pursuant to our partnership agreement these procedures benefit our general partner by providing our general partner with significant flexibility with respect to its ability to make decisions and pursue actions involving conflicts of interest given the significant flexibility afforded our general partner to resolve conflicts of interestincluding that our general partner has the right to determine not to seek the approval of the common unitholders with respect to the resolution of such conflictsthe general partner may resolve conflicts of interest pursuant to the partnership agreement in a manner that common unitholders may not believe to be in their or in our best interests neither our common unitholders nor we will have any recourse against our general partner if our general partner satisfies one of the standards described in the three bullet points above in addition to the provisions relating to conflicts of interest our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or other applicable law for example our partnership agreement provides that    when our general partner in its capacity as our general partner is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or discretion or pursuant to any provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of good faith then our general partner will not be subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any limited partners and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership agreement or otherwise existing at law in equity or otherwise these modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by delaware law hence we and our common unitholders will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our general partner if our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement unless our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement we and our common unitholders will not have any recourse against our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties furthermore even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our partnership agreement our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct these modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duty potential conflicts conflicts of interest could arise in the situations described below among others actions taken by our general partner may affect the amount of cash flow from operations to our common unitholders the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our common unitholders is affected by decisions of our general partner regarding such matters as        the amount and timing of cash expenditures including those relating to compensation        the amount and timing of investments and dispositions        levels of indebtedness        tax matters        levels of reserves and        issuances of additional partnership securities in addition borrowings by our partnership and our affiliates do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner to our common unitholders our partnership agreement provides that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds from our general partner and its affiliates on terms agreed to by our general partner in good faith under our partnership agreement those borrowings conclusively will be deemed to be in good faith and not a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty of the general partner if  they are approved by the conflicts committee of our general partner or by the vote of a majority of the voting power of our voting units excluding any voting units held by our general partner or any of its affiliates in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement or  they are otherwise approved by our general partner in good faith as determined under the partnership agreement account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved including other transactions that may be or have been particularly favorable or advantageous to us we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for expenses we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the expenses that are allocable to us    our general partner has historically limited  and intends to continue to limit its liability regarding our obligations our general partner has historically limited and intends to continue to limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the other party has recourse only to our assets and not against our general partner its assets or its owners our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability or our liability is not a breach of our general partners fiduciary duties even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability the limitation on our general partners liability does not constitute a waiver of compliance with us federal securities laws that would be void under section  of the securities act our common unitholders have no right to enforce obligations of our general partner and its affiliates under agreements with us any agreements between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other will not grant to the common unitholders separate and apart from us the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner and its affiliates in our favor contracts between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other will not be the result of armslength negotiations our partnership agreement allows our general partner to determine in its sole discretion any amounts to reimburse itself or its affiliates for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with our activities our general partner may also enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our behalf neither the partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements contracts and arrangements between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other are or will be the result of armslength negotiations our general partner will determine the terms of any of these transactions entered into on terms that it agrees to in good faith as determined under our partnership agreement our general partner and its affiliates will have no obligation to permit us to use any facilities or assets of our general partner and its affiliates except as may be provided in contracts entered into specifically dealing with that use there will not be any obligation of our general partner and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind our common units are subject to our general partners limited call right our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units as provided in our partnership agreement or assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us our general partner may use its own discretion free of fiduciary duty restrictions in determining whether to exercise this right as a result a common unitholder may have his common units purchased from him at an undesirable time or price see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership agreementlimited call right we may choose not to retain separate counsel for ourselves or for the holders of common units attorneys independent accountants and others who will perform services for us are selected by our general partner or the conflicts committee and may perform services for our general partner and its affiliates we are not required to retain separate counsel for ourselves or the holders of our common units in the event of a conflict of interest between our general partner and its affiliates on the one hand and us or the holders of our common units on the other our general partners affiliates may compete with us the partnership agreement provides that our general partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us the partnership agreement does not prohibit affiliates of the general partner including its owners from engaging in other business or activities including those that might compete directly with us    certain of our subsidiaries have obligations to investors in our investment funds and may have obligations to other third parties that may conflict with your interests our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our investment funds have certain duties and obligations to those funds and their investors and some of our subsidiaries may have contractual duties to other third parties as a result we expect to regularly take actions with respect to the allocation of investments among our investment funds including funds that have different fee structures the purchase or sale of investments in our investment funds the structuring of investment transactions for those funds the advice we provide or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations in addition directors and officers of our general partner our senior carlyle professionals operating executives and other professionals have made personal investments in and alongside a variety of our investment funds which may result in conflicts of interest among investors in our funds or our common unitholders regarding investment decisions for these funds some of these actions might at the same time adversely affect our nearterm results of operations or cash flow us federal income tax considerations of our partners may conflict with your interests because our partners hold their carlyle holdings partnership units directly or through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation and the carlyle group lp holds carlyle holdings partnership units through whollyowned subsidiaries at least one of which is subject to taxation as a corporation in the united states conflicts may arise between our partners and the carlyle group lp relating to the selection and structuring of investments or other matters our limited partners will be deemed to expressly acknowledge that our general partner is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of our limited partners including among other things the tax consequences to limited partners in deciding whether to cause us to take or decline to take any actions fiduciary duties duties owed to common unitholders by our general partner are prescribed by law and our partnership agreement the delaware limited partnership act provides that delaware limited partnerships may in their partnership agreements expand restrict or eliminate the duties including fiduciary duties otherwise owed by a general partner to limited partners and the partnership our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to our common unitholders and the partnership at law or in equity accordingly our general partner is only subject to the contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement and to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing we have adopted these modifications to allow our general partner and its affiliates to engage in transactions with us that might otherwise be prohibited by statelaw fiduciary duty standards and to take into account the interests of other parties in addition to our interests and the interests of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest without these modifications the general partners ability to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be restricted these modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including a fiduciary duty as described below and they permit our general partner to take into account its own interests and the interests of third parties in addition to our interests and the interests of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest    the following is a summary of the duties owed by our general partner to the limited partners under our partnership agreement as compared to the default fiduciary duty standards that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to the limited partners at law or in equity   state law fiduciary duty standards      fiduciary duties are generally considered to include an obligation to act in good faith and with due care and loyalty in the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise the duty of care would generally require a general partner to inform itself prior to making a business decision of all material information reasonably available to it in the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise the duty of loyalty would generally prohibit a general partner of a delaware limited partnership from taking any action or engaging in any transaction that is not fair to and in the best interests of the partnership where a conflict of interest is present partnership agreement modified standards      general  our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive duties of or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law for example our partnership agreement provides that when our general partner in its capacity as our general partner is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or pursuant to any provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of good faith then our general partner will not be subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any factors affecting us or any limited partners including our common unitholders and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership agreement or otherwise existing of law in equity or otherwise in addition when our general partner is acting in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner it may act without any fiduciary obligation to us or the common unitholders whatsoever these standards reduce the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be held      in addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the obligations of our general partner our partnership agreement further provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us our limited partners including our common unitholders or assignees for errors of

registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and is referred to in this prospectus as our partnership agreement the following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto general partner our general partner carlyle group management llc manages all of our operations and activities our general partner is authorized in general to perform all acts that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out our purposes and to conduct our business our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties of our general partner and limit remedies available to common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty see conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities carlyle group management llc is whollyowned by our senior carlyle professionals our common unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore have limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business the voting rights of our common unitholders are limited as set forth in our partnership agreement and in the delaware limited partnership act for example our general partner may generally make amendments to our partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership without the approval of any common unitholder as set forth under amendment of the partnership agreementno limited partner approval organization we were formed on july   and will continue until cancellation of our certificate of limited partnership as provided in the delaware limited partnership act purpose under our partnership agreement we are be permitted to engage directly or indirectly in any business activity that is approved by our general partner in

partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership in each case in accordance with our partnership agreement capital contributions our common unitholders are not obligated to make additional capital contributions except as described below under limited liability our general partner is not obligated to make any capital contributions limited liability assuming that a limited partner does not participate in the control of our business within the meaning of the delaware limited partnership act and that he she or it otherwise acts in conformity with the provisions of our partnership agreement his her or its liability under the delaware limited partnership act will be limited subject    to possible exceptions to the amount of capital he she or it is obligated to contribute to us for his her or its common units plus his her or its share of any undistributed profits and assets plus his her or its obligation to make other payments that is provided for in our partnership agreement if it were determined however that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group        to elect the directors of our general partner in limited circumstances        to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or        to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business for the purposes of the delaware limited partnership act then our limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of delaware to the same extent as our general partner this liability would extend to persons who transact business with us who reasonably believe that the limited partner is a general partner neither our partnership agreement nor the delaware limited partnership act specifically provides for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general partner while this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse we know of no precedent for this type of a claim in delaware case law the limitation on our general partners liability does not constitute a waiver of compliance with us federal securities laws that would be void under section  of the securities act under the delaware limited partnership act a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all liabilities of the limited partnership other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited partnership for the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited partnership the delaware limited partnership act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited will be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability the delaware limited partnership act provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution under the delaware limited partnership act a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of his assignor to make contributions to the partnership except that such person is not obligated for liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the partnership agreement moreover if it were determined that we were conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute or that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group to elect the directors of our general partner to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the law of that jurisdiction to the same extent as our general partner under the circumstances we intend to operate in a manner that our general partner considers reasonable and necessary or appropriate to preserve the limited liability of the limited partners issuance of additional securities our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and options rights warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our general partner

must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the common units beneficially owned by the nonvoting common unitholders however unaffiliated third party transferees of common units from a nonvoting common unitholder will have the same voting rights with respect to such common units as other holders of common units status as limited partner by transfer of common units in accordance with our partnership agreement each transferee of common units will be admitted as a limited partner with respect to the common units transferred when such transfer and admission is reflected in our books and records the common units will be fully paid and nonassessable except as such nonassessability may be affected by section  as described under limited liability above pursuant to section

time of such distribution that it was in violation of this provision or as set forth in the partnership agreement noncitizen assignees redemption if the partnership or any subsidiary is or becomes subject to federal state or local laws or regulations that in the determination of our general partner in its sole discretion create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property in

partner at their current market price to avoid any cancellation or forfeiture our general partner may require each limited partner to furnish information about his her or its nationality citizenship or related status if a limited partner fails to furnish information about his nationality citizenship or other related status within  days after receipt of a request for the information or our general partner determines with the advice of counsel after receipt of the information that the limited partner is not an eligible citizen the limited partner may be treated as a noncitizen assignee a

purposes our year ends on december  as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each fiscal year we will furnish to each partner tax information including a schedule k which describes on a us dollar basis such partners share of our income gain loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year although we currently intend to distribute schedule ks on or around  days after the end of our fiscal year it may require longer than  days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lowertier entities so that schedule ks may be prepared for our partnership consequently holders of common units who are us taxpayers should anticipate that they may need to file annually with the us internal revenue service irs and certain states a request for an extension

with third parties to keep confidential in addition our partnership agreement provides for certain restrictions on the rights of a limited partner to receive information from us for the purpose of determining whether to pursue litigation or assist in pending litigation against us    material us federal tax considerations this summary discusses the material us federal income tax considerations related to the purchase ownership and disposition of our common units as of the date hereof for purposes of this discussion references to carlyle we our and us mean only the carlyle group lp and not its subsidiaries except as otherwise indicated this summary is based on provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended on the regulations promulgated thereunder and on published administrative rulings and pronouncements of the irs and judicial decisions all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time possibly with retroactive effect this discussion is necessarily general and may not apply to all categories of investors some of which such as banks or other financial institutions real estate investment trusts investors who are deemed to own  or more of our common units persons holding common units as part of a hedging integrated or conversion transaction or straddle traders in securities that elect to use a marktomarket method of accounting for their securities holdings charitable remainder unit trusts common trust funds insurance companies persons liable for the alternative minimum tax dealers and other investors that do not own their common units as capital assets may be subject to special rules taxexempt organizations and mutual funds are discussed separately below in addition except to the extent provided below this discussion does not address any aspect of state local or nonus tax law the actual tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of common units will vary depending on your circumstances this discussion to the extent that it states matters of us federal tax law or legal conclusions and subject to the qualifications herein represents the opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp such opinion is based in part on facts described in this prospectus and on various other factual assumptions representations and determinations any alteration or incorrectness of such facts assumptions representations or determinations could adversely affect such opinion however opinions of counsel are not binding upon the irs or any court and the irs may challenge the conclusions herein and a court may sustain such a challenge for purposes of this discussion a us holder is a beneficial holder of a common unit that is for us federal income tax purposes  an individual citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia  an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or  a trust which either a is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the united states and one or more united states persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person a nonus holder is a holder other than a partnership that is not a us holder if a partnership holds common units the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership if you are a partner of a partnership holding our common units you should consult your tax advisors this discussion does not constitute tax advice and is not intended to be a substitute for tax planning prospective holders of common units should consult their own tax advisors concerning the us federal state and local income tax and estate tax consequences in their particular situations of the purchase ownership and disposition of a common unit as well as any consequences under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships subject to the discussion set forth in the next paragraph an entity that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no us federal income tax liability instead each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income gain loss and deduction of the partnership in computing its us federal income tax liability regardless of whether or not cash distributions are then made investors in our common units will become limited partners of the carlyle group lp distributions of cash by a partnership to a partner are generally not taxable unless the amount of cash distributed to a partner is in excess of the partners adjusted basis in its partnership interest    an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a publicly traded partnership unless an exception applies an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if i interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or ii interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof we are publicly traded however an exception to taxation as a corporation referred to as the qualifying income exception exists if at least  of such partnerships gross income for every taxable year consists of qualifying income and the partnership is not required to register under the  act qualifying income includes certain interest income dividends real property rents gains from the sale or other disposition of real property and any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income qualifying income does not generally include fees paid in respect of services we expect that allocations of carried interest from investments in stock and securities of corporations will typically consist of qualifying income because such allocations will generally consist of gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset interest and dividends income in respect of management advisory and incentive fees as well as income allocations from our interest in investments in businesses conducted in noncorporate form such as partnerships or llcs will typically not constitute qualifying income we generally hold investments that generate nonqualifying income separately from our investments that generate qualifying income which include allocations of carried interest from investments in stock and securities of corporations we generally hold investments that earn nonqualifying fee income such as management fees incentive fees and advisory fees through entities classified as corporations for us federal income tax purposes including carlyle holdings i gp inc and carlyle holdings iii gp lp distributions received from such corporations will generally constitute qualifying income our general partner has adopted a set of investment policies and procedures that govern the types of investments we can make and income we can earn including structuring certain investments through entities classified as corporations for us federal income tax purposes to ensure that we will meet the qualifying income exception in each taxable year it is the opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp that we will be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on certain assumptions and factual statements and representations made by us including statements and representations as to the manner in which we intend to manage our affairs the composition of our income and that our general partner will ensure that we comply with the investment policies and procedures put in place to ensure that we meet the qualifying income exception in each taxable year however this opinion is based solely on current law and does not take into account any proposed or potential changes in law which may be enacted with retroactive effect moreover opinions of counsel are not binding upon the irs or any court and the irs may challenge this conclusion and a court may sustain such a challenge if we fail to meet the qualifying income exception other than a failure that is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery or if we are required to register under the  act we will be treated as if we had transferred all of our assets subject to liabilities to a newly formed corporation on the first day of the year in which we fail to meet the qualifying income exception in return for stock in that corporation and then distributed the stock to the holders of common units in liquidation of their interests in us this deemed contribution and liquidation should generally be taxfree to holders so long as we do not have liabilities in excess of the tax basis of our assets at that time thereafter we would be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes if we were treated as a corporation in any taxable year either as a result of a failure to meet the qualifying income exception or otherwise our items of income gain loss and deduction would be reflected only on our tax return rather than being passed through to holders of common units and we would be subject to us corporate income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates thereby materially reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our common units distributions made to holders of our common units would be treated as either taxable dividend income which may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation to the    extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits or in the absence of earnings and profits as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the holders tax basis in the common units or as taxable capital gain after the holders basis is reduced to zero in addition in the case of nonus holders income that we receive with respect to investments may be subject to a higher rate of us withholding tax accordingly treatment as a corporation could materially reduce a holders aftertax return and thus could result in a substantial reduction of the value of the common units if at the end of any taxable year we fail to meet the qualifying income exception we may still qualify as a partnership if we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code for an inadvertent termination of partnership status this relief will be available if i the failure is cured within a reasonable time after discovery ii the failure is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and iii we agree to make such adjustments including adjustments with respect to our partners or to pay such amounts as are required by the irs it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to this relief in any or all circumstances it also is not clear under the internal revenue code whether this relief is available for our first taxable year as a publicly traded partnership if this relief provision is inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances involving us we will not qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes even if this relief provision applies and we retain our partnership status we or the holders of our common units during the failure period will be required to pay such amounts as are determined by the irs the remainder of this section assumes that we and the carlyle holdings partnerships will be treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes taxation of carlyle holdings i gp inc carlyle holdings i gp inc is taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and therefore as the holder of carlyle holdings i gp incs common stock we will not be taxed directly on earnings of entities we hold through carlyle holdings i gp inc distributions of cash or other property that carlyle holdings i gp inc pays to us will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles if the amount of a distribution by carlyle holdings i gp inc exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits such excess will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of our tax basis in carlyle holdings i gp incs common stock and thereafter will be treated as a capital gain we hold certain of our entities that are expected to generate income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception through carlyle holdings i gp inc which is a corporation for us federal income tax purposes so that income in respect of such investments will be paid to us as distributions from carlyle holdings i gp inc that will constitute qualifying income carlyle holdings i gp inc will incur us federal income taxes on its proportionate share of any net taxable income of carlyle holdings i lp in accordance with its partnership agreement we will cause carlyle holdings i lp to distribute cash on a pro rata basis to holders of its units that is carlyle holdings i gp inc and the limited partners of carlyle holdings i lp in an amount at least equal to the maximum tax liabilities arising from their ownership of such units if any taxation of carlyle holdings ii gp llc as a single member limited liability company that has not elected to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes carlyle holdings ii gp llc will be treated as an entity disregarded as a separate entity from us accordingly all the assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of carlyle holdings ii gp llc will be treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit carlyle holdings ii gp llc invests directly or indirectly in a variety of assets and otherwise engages in activities and derives income that is consistent with the qualifying income exception discussed above    taxation of carlyle holdings iii gp lp carlyle holdings iii gp lp is a whollyowned société en commandite organized in québec carlyle holdings iii gp lp is taxable as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes distributions of cash or other property that carlyle holdings iii gp lp pays to us will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles if the amount of a distribution by carlyle holdings iii gp lp exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits such excess will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of our tax basis in carlyle holdings iii gp lps common stock and thereafter will be treated as a capital gain income realized by carlyle holdings iii gp lp will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent it has a foreign source and is not treated as eci carlyle holdings iii gp lp is expected to be operated so as not to produce eci its assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit will not be treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit we expect to hold certain of our entities that are expected to generate income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception through carlyle holdings iii gp lp which is a corporation for us federal income tax purposes so that income in respect of such entities will be paid to us as distributions from carlyle holdings iii gp lp that will constitute qualifying income personal holding companies carlyle holdings i gp inc could be subject to additional us federal income tax on a portion of its income if it is determined to be a personal holding company or phc for us federal income tax purposes subject to certain exceptions a us corporation generally will be classified as a phc for us federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if i at any time during the last half of such taxable year five or fewer individuals without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain taxexempt organizations and pension funds own or are deemed to own pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules more than  of the stock of the corporation by value and ii at least  of the corporations adjusted ordinary gross income as determined for us federal income tax purposes for such taxable year consists of phc income which includes among other things dividends interest royalties annuities and under certain circumstances rents the phc rules do not apply to nonus corporations due to applicable attribution rules it is likely that five or fewer individuals or taxexempt organizations will be treated as owning actually or constructively more than  of the value of units in carlyle holdings i gp inc consequently carlyle holdings i gp inc could be or become a phc depending on whether it fails the phc gross income test if as a factual matter the income of carlyle holdings i gp inc fails the phc gross income test it will be a phc certain aspects of the gross income test cannot be predicted with certainty thus no assurance can be given that carlyle holdings i gp inc is not or will not in the future become a phc if carlyle holdings i gp inc is or were to become a phc in a given taxable year it would be subject to an additional  phc tax on its undistributed phc income which generally includes the companys taxable income subject to certain adjustments if carlyle holdings i gp inc were to become a phc and had significant amounts of undistributed phc income the amount of phc tax could be material in that event distribution of such income would generally reduce the phc income subject to tax certain state local and nonus tax matters we and our subsidiaries may be subject to state local or nonus taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business own property or reside for example we and our subsidiaries may be subject to new york city andor district of columbia unincorporated business tax we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions the state local or nonus tax treatment of us and our common unitholders may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed herein we will pay nonus taxes and dispositions of foreign property or operations involving or investments in foreign    property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liability in amounts that could be substantial any nonus taxes incurred by us may not pass through to common unitholders as a credit against their us federal income tax liability consequences to us holders of common units the following is a summary of the material us federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a us holder of common units for us federal income tax purposes your allocable share of our recognized items of income gain loss deduction or credit and our allocable share of those items of carlyle holdings will be determined by the limited partnership agreements for our partnership and carlyle holdings if such allocations have substantial economic effect or are determined to be in accordance with your interest in our partnership we believe that for us federal income tax purposes such allocations will be given effect as being in accordance with your interest in the carlyle group lp and our general partner intends to prepare tax returns based on such allocations if the irs successfully challenges the allocations made pursuant to the limited partnership agreements the resulting allocations for us federal income tax purposes might be less favorable than the allocations set forth in the limited partnership agreements with respect to us holders who are individuals certain dividends paid by a corporation including certain qualified foreign corporations to us may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of specified income tax treaties with the united states in addition a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states we do not expect that carlyle holdings iii gp lp will be a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of the reduced rates of taxation on dividends among other exceptions a us holder who is an individual will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividend if the payer is a pfic as defined below in the taxable year in which such dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year or on any income required to be reported by the us holder as a result of a qef election as defined below that is attributable to a dividend received by an entity that is a pfic and in which the fund holds a direct or indirect interest prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances we may derive taxable income from an investment that is not matched by a corresponding distribution of cash this could occur for example if we used cash to make an investment or to reduce debt instead of distributing profits in addition special provisions of the internal revenue code may be applicable to certain of our investments and may affect the timing of our income requiring us and consequently you to recognize taxable income before we or you receive cash attributable to such income accordingly it is possible that your us federal income tax liability with respect to your allocable share of our income for a particular taxable year could exceed any cash distribution you receive for the year thus giving rise to an outofpocket tax liability for you us holders that are individuals estates or trusts are subject to a medicare tax of  on net investment income or undistributed net investment income in the case of estates and trusts for each taxable year with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such persons adjusted gross income with certain adjustments over a specified amount net investment income includes net income from interest dividends annuities royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of investment property it is anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in our common units will be included in a us holders net investment income subject to this medicare tax basis you will have an initial tax basis for your common unit equal to the amount you paid for the common unit plus your share under the partnership tax rules of our liabilities if any that basis will be increased by your share of our income and by increases in your share of our liabilities if any that basis will be decreased but not below zero by distributions from us by your share of our losses and by any decrease in your share of our liabilities    holders who purchase common units in separate transactions must combine the basis of those units and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all those units upon a sale or other disposition of less than all of the common units a portion of that tax basis must be allocated to the common units sold limits on deductions for losses and expenses your deduction of your share of our losses will be limited to your tax basis in your common units and if you are an individual or a corporate holder that is subject to the at risk rules to the amount for which you are considered to be at risk with respect to our activities if that is less than your tax basis in general you will be at risk to the extent of your tax basis in your common units reduced by  the portion of that basis attributable to your share of our liabilities for which you will not be personally liable and  any amount of money you borrow to acquire or hold your common units if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us is related to you or can look only to the common units for repayment your at risk amount generally will increase by your allocable share of our income and gain and decrease by cash distributions to you and your allocable share of losses and deductions you must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions cause your at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year losses disallowed or recaptured as a result of these limitations will carry forward and will be allowable to the extent that your tax basis or at risk amount whichever is the limiting factor subsequently increases any excess loss above that gain previously suspended by the at risk or basis limitations may no longer be used we do not expect to generate income or losses from passive activities for purposes of section  of the internal revenue code accordingly income allocated to you by us may not be offset by your section  passive losses and losses allocated to you generally may not be used to offset your section  passive income in addition other provisions of the internal revenue code may limit or disallow any deduction for losses by you or deductions associated with certain assets of the partnership in certain cases including potentially section  of the internal revenue code you should consult with your tax advisors regarding their limitations on the deductibility of losses under applicable sections of the internal revenue code limitations on deductibility of organizational expenses and syndication fees in general neither we nor any us holder may deduct organizational or syndication expenses an election may be made by our partnership to amortize organizational expenses over a year period syndication fees which would include any sales or placement fees or commissions or underwriting discount payable to third parties must be capitalized and cannot be amortized or otherwise deducted limitations on interest deductions your share of our interest expense is likely to be treated as investment interest expense if you are a noncorporate us holder the deductibility of investment interest expense is generally limited to the amount of your net investment income your share of our dividend and interest income will be treated as investment income although qualified dividend income subject to reduced rates of tax in the hands of an individual will only be treated as investment income if you elect to treat such dividend as ordinary income not subject to reduced rates of tax in addition state and local tax laws may disallow deductions for your share of our interest expense the computation of your investment interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other loan incurred to purchase a common unit net investment income includes gross income from property held for investment and amounts treated as portfolio income such as dividends and interest under the passive loss rules less deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income but generally does not include gains attributable to the disposition of property held for investment for this purpose any longterm capital gain or qualifying dividend income that is taxable at longterm capital gain rates is excluded from net investment income unless the us holder elects to pay tax on such gain or dividend income at ordinary income rates    deductibility of partnership investment expenditures by individual partners and by trusts and estates subject to certain exceptions all miscellaneous itemized deductions of an individual taxpayer and certain of such deductions of an estate or trust are deductible only to the extent that such deductions exceed  of the taxpayers adjusted gross income moreover the otherwise allowable itemized deductions of individuals whose gross income exceeds an applicable threshold amount are subject to reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of   of the excess of the individuals adjusted gross income over the threshold amount or   of the amount of the itemized deductions the operating expenses of carlyle holdings including the management fee and management fees paid with respect to private funds advised by carlyle to the extent these private funds are treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes may be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the foregoing rule alternatively it is possible that we will be required to capitalize the management fees accordingly if you are a noncorporate us holder you should consult your tax advisors with respect to the application of these limitations treatment of distributions distributions of cash by us will not be taxable to you to the extent of your adjusted tax basis described above in your common units any cash distributions in excess of your adjusted tax basis will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of common units described below under current laws such gain would be treated as capital gain and would be longterm capital gain if your holding period for your common units exceeds one year subject to certain exceptions described below a reduction in your allocable share of our liabilities and certain distributions of marketable securities by us are treated similar to cash distributions for us federal income tax purposes sale or exchange of common units you will recognize gain or loss on a sale of common units equal to the difference if any between the amount realized and your tax basis in the common units sold your amount realized will be measured by the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property received plus your share under the partnership tax rules of our liabilities if any your adjusted tax basis will be adjusted for this purpose by your allocable share of our income or loss for the year of such sale or other disposition gain or loss recognized by you on the sale or exchange of a common unit generally will be taxable as capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if all of the common units you hold were held for more than one year on the date of such sale or exchange assuming we have not made an election referred to as a qef election to treat our interest in a passive foreign investment company or pfic as a qualified electing fund or qef gain attributable to such investment in a pfic would be taxable as ordinary income and would be subject to an interest charge see passive foreign investment companies in addition certain gain attributable to our investment in a controlled foreign corporation or cfc may be characterized as ordinary income and certain gain attributable to unrealized receivables or inventory items would be characterized as ordinary income rather than capital gain for example if we hold debt acquired at a market discount accrued market discount on such debt would be treated as unrealized receivables the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations holders who purchase units at different times and intend to sell all or a portion of the units within a year of their most recent purchase are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of certain split holding period rules to them and the treatment of any gain or loss as longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss foreign tax credit limitations you generally will be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to your allocable share of creditable foreign taxes paid on our income and gains complex rules may depending on your particular circumstances    limit the availability or use of foreign tax credits gains from the sale of our investments may be treated as us source gains consequently you may not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any foreign taxes imposed on such gains unless such credit can be applied subject to applicable limitations against tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources certain losses that we incur may be treated as foreign source losses which could reduce the amount of foreign tax credits otherwise available section  election we have not made and currently do not intend to make the election permitted by section  of the internal revenue code with respect to us or carlyle holdings ii lp carlyle holdings i lp and carlyle holdings iii lp have made such an election the election is irrevocable without the consent of the irs and generally requires the electing partnership to adjust the tax basis in its assets or inside basis attributable to a transferee of interests in the electing partnership under section b of the internal revenue code to reflect the purchase price of such interests paid by the transferee as a result of carlyle holdings i lp and carlyle holdings iii lp having made the section  election carlyle holdings i gp inc and carlyle holdings iii gp lp respectively are required to adjust the basis in their assets attributable to interests in carlyle holding i lp acquired by carlyle holdings i gp inc and interests in carlyle holdings iii lp acquired by carlyle holdings iii gp lp from the limited partners of carlyle holdings i lp and carlyle holdings iii lp pursuant to the exchange agreement described under certain relationships and related person transactionsexchange agreement if as intended we do not make the section  election with respect to us no similar adjustment to basis in assets owned directly or indirectly by us attributable to common units acquired by transferees would be made because we own our interests in carlyle holdings i lp indirectly through carlyle holdings i gp inc a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and our interests in carlyle holdings iii lp indirectly though carlyle holdings iii gp lp a corporation for us federal income tax purposes there is no adjustment to the inside basis for a transferee of common units in respect of carlyle holdings i lp or carlyle holdings iii lp regardless of whether a section  election is made in respect of us or those partnerships if no section  election is made by us and carlyle holdings ii lp there will be no adjustment for the transferee of common units even if the purchase price of those common units is higher than the common units share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets or the assets of carlyle holdings ii lp immediately prior to the transfer in that case on a sale of any such asset gain allocable to the transferee would include builtin gain allocable to the transferee at the time of the transfer which builtin gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if we and carlyle holdings ii lp had made a section  election even assuming no section  election is made if common units are transferred at a time when we had a substantial builtin loss inherent in our assets we would be obligated to reduce the tax basis in the portion of such assets attributable to such common units the calculations under section  of the internal revenue code are complex we will make them on the basis of assumptions as to the value of our assets and other matters uniformity of common units because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we have adopted depreciation amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our common unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our common unitholders tax returns    foreign currency gain or loss our functional currency is the us dollar and our income or loss is calculated in us dollars it is likely that we will recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to transactions involving nonus dollar currencies in general foreign currency gain or loss is treated as ordinary income or loss you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the tax treatment of foreign currency gain or loss passive foreign investment companies you may be subject to special rules applicable to indirect investments in foreign corporations including an investment in a pfic carlyle holdings i gp inc will be subject to rules similar to those described below with respect to any pfics owned directly or indirectly by it a pfic is defined as any foreign corporation with respect to which either   or more of the gross income for a taxable year is passive income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated thereunder or   or more of its assets in any taxable year generally based on the quarterly average of the value of its assets produce passive income there are no minimum stock ownership requirements for pfics once a corporation qualifies as a pfic it is subject to certain exceptions always treated as a pfic regardless of whether it satisfies either of the qualification tests in subsequent years any gain on disposition of stock of a pfic as well as income realized on certain excess distributions by the pfic is treated as though realized ratably over the shorter of your holding period of common units or our holding period for the pfic such gain or income is taxable as ordinary income and as discussed above dividends paid by a pfic to an individual will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation that are available for certain qualifying dividends in addition an interest charge would be imposed on you based on the tax deferred from prior years although it may not always be possible we expect to make a qef election where possible with respect to each entity treated as a pfic to treat such nonus entity as a qef in the first year we hold shares in such entity however we expect that in many circumstances we may not have access to information necessary to make a qef election because for example one of our investment funds may hold minority interests directly or indirectly in an entity over which we have no control a qef election is effective for our taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs if we make a qef election under the internal revenue code with respect to our interest in a pfic in lieu of the foregoing treatment we would be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qef called qef inclusions even if not distributed to us thus holders may be required to report taxable income as a result of qef inclusions without corresponding receipts of cash however a holder may elect to defer until the occurrence of certain events payment of the us federal income tax attributable to qef inclusions for which no current distributions are received but will be required to pay interest on the deferred tax computed by using the statutory rate of interest applicable to an extension of time for payment of tax however net losses if any of a nonus entity owned through carlyle holdings ii gp llc that is treated as a pfic will not pass through to us or to holders and may not be carried back or forward in computing such pfics ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years consequently holders may over time be taxed on amounts that as an economic matter exceed our net profits our tax basis in the shares of such nonus entities and a holders basis in our common units will be increased to reflect qef inclusions no portion of the qef inclusion attributable to ordinary income will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income of individual us holders amounts included as qef inclusions with respect to direct and indirect investments generally will not be taxed again when distributed you should consult your tax advisors as to the manner in which qef inclusions affect your allocable share of our income and your basis in your common units alternatively in the case of a pfic that is a publiclytraded foreign portfolio company we may make an election to mark to market the stock of such foreign portfolio company on an annual basis pursuant to such an election you would include in each year as ordinary income the excess if any of the fair market value of such    stock over its adjusted basis at the end of the taxable year you may treat as ordinary loss any excess of the adjusted basis of the stock over its fair market value at the end of the year but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the election in prior years when making investment or other decisions we will consider whether an investment will be a pfic and the tax consequences related thereto we may make certain investments including for instance investments in specialized investment funds or investments in funds of funds through nonus corporate subsidiaries of the carlyle holdings partnerships or through other nonus corporations such entities may be a pfics for us federal income tax purposes in addition certain of our investments could be in pfics thus we can make no assurance that some of our investments will not be treated as held through a pfic or as interests in pfics or that such pfics will be eligible for the mark to market election or that as to any such pfics we will be able to make qef elections if we do not make a qef election with respect to a pfic section  of the internal revenue code will treat all gain on a disposition by us of shares of such entity gain on the disposition of common units by a holder at a time when we own shares of such entity as well as certain other defined excess distributions as if the gain or excess distribution were ordinary income earned ratably over the shorter of the period during which the holder held its common units or the period during which we held our shares in such entity for gain and excess distributions allocated to prior years i the tax rate will be the highest in effect for that taxable year and ii the tax will be payable generally without regard to offsets from deductions losses and expenses holders will also be subject to an interest charge for any deferred tax no portion of this ordinary income will be eligible for the favorable tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for individual us persons controlled foreign corporations a nonus entity will be treated as a cfc if it is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and if more than  of i the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the nonus entity entitled to vote or ii the total value of the stock of the nonus entity is owned by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such nonus entity for purposes of this discussion a us shareholder with respect to a nonus entity means a us person that owns  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the nonus entity entitled to vote when making investment or other decisions we will consider whether an investment will be a cfc and the consequences related thereto if we are a us shareholder in a nonus entity that is treated as a cfc each common unitholder may be required to include in income its allocable share of the cfcs subpart f income reported by us subpart f income generally includes dividends interest net gain from the sale or disposition of securities nonactively managed rents fees for services provided to certain related persons and certain other generally passive types of income the aggregate subpart f income inclusions in any taxable year relating to a particular cfc are limited to such entitys current earnings and profits these inclusions are treated as ordinary income whether or not such inclusions are attributable to net capital gains thus an investor may be required to report as ordinary income its allocable share of the cfcs subpart f income reported by us without corresponding receipts of cash and may not benefit from capital gain treatment with respect to the portion of our earnings if any attributable to net capital gains of the cfc the tax basis of our shares of such nonus entity and a holders tax basis in our common units will be increased to reflect any required subpart f income inclusions such income will be treated as income from sources within the united states for certain foreign tax credit purposes to the extent derived by the cfc from us sources such income will not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax applicable to qualified dividend income for individual us persons see consequences to us holders of common units amounts included as such income with respect to direct and indirect investments generally will not be taxable again when distributed regardless of whether any cfc has subpart f income any gain allocated to you from our disposition of stock in a cfc will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of your allocable share of the current andor    accumulated earnings and profits of the cfc in this regard earnings would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the cfc rules however net losses if any of a nonus entity owned by us that is treated as a cfc will not pass through to you moreover a portion of your gain from the sale or exchange of your common units may be treated as ordinary income any portion of any gain from the sale or exchange of a common unit that is attributable to a cfc may be treated as an unrealized receivable taxable as ordinary income see sale or exchange of common units if a nonus entity held by us is classified as both a cfc and a pfic during the time we are a us shareholder of such nonus entity a holder will be required to include amounts in income with respect to such nonus entity pursuant to this subheading and the consequences described under the subheading passive foreign investment companies above will not apply if our ownership percentage in a nonus entity changes such that we are not a us shareholder with respect to such nonus entity then common unitholders may be subject to the pfic rules the interaction of these rules is complex and prospective holders are urged to consult their tax advisors in this regard it is expected that carlyle holdings iii gp lp will be a cfc subject to the above rules and as such each common unitholder that is a us person will be required to include in income its allocable share of carlyle holdings iii gp lps subpart f income reported by us investment structure to manage our affairs so as to meet the qualifying income exception for the publicly traded partnership rules discussed above and comply with certain requirements in our limited partnership agreement we may need to structure certain investments through an entity classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes however because our common unitholders will be located in numerous taxing jurisdictions no assurances can be given that any such investment structure will be beneficial to all our common unitholders to the same extent and may even impose additional tax burdens on some of our common unitholders as discussed above if the entity were a nonus corporation it may be considered a cfc or a pfic if the entity were a us corporation it would be subject to us federal income tax on its operating income including any gain recognized on its disposal of its investments in addition if the investment involves us real estate gain recognized on disposition would generally be subject to such tax whether the corporation is a us or a nonus corporation taxes in other state local and nonus jurisdictions in addition to us federal income tax consequences you may be subject to potential us state and local taxes because of an investment in us in the us state or locality in which you are a resident for tax purposes or in which we have investments or activities you may also be subject to tax return filing obligations and income franchise or other taxes including withholding taxes in state local or nonus jurisdictions in which we invest or in which entities in which we own interests conduct activities or derive income income or gains from investments held by us may be subject to withholding or other taxes in jurisdictions outside the united states subject to the possibility of reduction under applicable income tax treaties if you wish to claim the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty you may be required to submit information to tax authorities in such jurisdictions you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the us state local and nonus tax consequences of an investment in us transferortransferee allocations in general our taxable income and losses will be determined and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law as a result if you transfer your common units you may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer similarly a transferee may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferees acquisition of our common units    although section  of the internal revenue code generally provides guidelines for allocations of items of partnership income and deductions between transferors and transferees of partnership interests it is not clear that our allocation method complies with its requirements if our convention were not permitted the irs might contend that our taxable income or losses must be reallocated among the investors if such a contention were sustained your respective tax liabilities would be adjusted to your possible detriment our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees as well as among investors whose interests otherwise vary during a taxable period us federal estate taxes if common units are included in the gross estate of a us citizen or resident for us federal estate tax purposes then a us federal estate tax might be payable in connection with the death of such person prospective individual us holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the potential us federal estate tax consequences with respect to our common units us taxation of taxexempt us holders of common units a holder of common units that is a taxexempt entity for us federal income tax purposes including an individual retirement account or k plan participant and therefore generally exempt from us federal income taxation may nevertheless be subject to tax on any unrelated business taxable income or ubti to the extent if any that its allocable share of our income consists of ubti a taxexempt partner of a partnership that regularly engages in a trade or business which is unrelated to the exempt function of the taxexempt partner must include in computing its ubti its pro rata share whether or not distributed of such partnerships gross income derived from such unrelated trade or business moreover a taxexempt partner of a partnership could be treated as earning ubti to the extent that such partnership derives income from debtfinanced property or if the partnership interest itself is debt financed debtfinanced property means property held to produce income with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness that is indebtedness incurred in acquiring or holding property while we do not expect to generate significant amounts of ubti for taxexempt us holders of our common units as a result of direct investments in operating businesses certain of our investments may be treated as debtfinanced investments which may give rise to debtfinanced ubti accordingly no assurance can be given that we will not generate ubti currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerationstaxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize ubti taxexempt us holders of common units should consult with their own tax advisors regarding all aspects of ubti investments by us mutual funds us mutual funds that are treated as regulated investment companies or rics for us federal income tax purposes are required among other things to meet an annual  gross income and a quarterly  asset value test under section b of the internal revenue code to maintain their favorable us federal income tax status the treatment of an investment by a ric in common units for purposes of these tests will depend on whether we are treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership if our partnership is so treated then the common units themselves are the relevant assets for purposes of the  asset value test and the net income from the common units is the relevant gross income for purposes of the  gross income test rics may not invest greater than  of their assets in one or more qualifying publicly traded partnerships all income derived from a qualifying publicly traded partnership is considered qualifying income for purposes of the ric  gross income test above however if we are not treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership for purposes of the ric rules then the relevant assets for the ric asset test will be the rics allocable share of the underlying assets held by us and the relevant gross income for the ric income test will be the rics allocable share of the underlying gross income earned by us whether we will qualify as a qualifying publicly traded partnership    depends on the exact nature of our future investments but it is likely that we will not be treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership in addition as discussed above under consequences to us holders of common units we may derive taxable income from an investment that is not matched by a corresponding cash distribution accordingly a ric investing in our common units may recognize income for us federal income tax purposes without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements under sections  and  of the internal revenue code for avoiding income and excise taxes rics should consult their own tax advisors about the us tax consequences of an investment in common units consequences to nonus holders of common units us income tax consequences in light of our intended investment activities we generally do not expect to be treated as engaged in a us trade or business or to generate significant amounts of eci for nonus holders of our common units however there can be no assurance that we will not generate eci currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerationstaxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize eci moreover there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a us trade or business such that some portion of our income is properly treated as eci if a nonus holder were treated as being engaged in a us trade or business in any year because of an investment in our common units in such year such nonus holder generally would be  subject to withholding by us on any actual distributions  required to file a us federal income tax return for such year reporting its allocable share if any of income or loss effectively connected with such trade or business including certain income from us sources not related to the carlyle group lp and  required to pay us federal income tax at regular us federal income tax rates on any such income moreover a corporate nonus holder might be subject to a us branch profits tax on its allocable share of our eci any amount so withheld would be creditable against such nonus holders us federal income tax liability and such nonus holder could claim a refund to the extent that the amount withheld exceeded such nonus holders us federal income tax liability for the taxable year finally if we were treated as being engaged in a us trade or business a portion of any gain recognized by a holder who is a nonus holder on the sale or exchange of its common units could be treated for us federal income tax purposes as eci and hence such nonus holder could be subject to us federal income tax on the sale or exchange of our common units generally under the foreign investment in real property tax act of  firpta provisions of the internal revenue code nonus persons are subject to us federal income tax in the same manner as us persons on any gain realized on the disposition of an interest other than an interest solely as a creditor in us real property an interest in us real property includes stock in a us corporation except for certain stock of publicly traded us corporations if interests in us real property constitute  or more by value of the sum of the corporations assets used in a trade or business its us real property interests and its interests in real property located outside the united states a united states real property holding corporation or usrphc the firpta tax applies if a nonus person is a holder of an interest in a partnership that realizes gain in respect of an interest in us real property or an interest in a usrphc we may from time to time make certain investments other than direct investments in us real property for example through one of our investment funds held by carlyle holdings ii gp llc that could constitute investments in us real property or usrphcs if we make such investments each nonus holder will be subject to us federal income tax under firpta on such holders allocable share of any gain we realize on the disposition of a firpta interest and will be subject to the tax return filing requirements regarding eci discussed above although each nonus holder is required to provide an irs form w we may not be able to provide complete information related to the tax status of our investors to carlyle holdings for purposes of obtaining reduced rates of withholding on behalf of our investors accordingly to the extent we receive dividends from a us corporation through carlyle holdings and its investment vehicles your allocable share of distributions of such dividend income will be subject to us withholding tax at a  rate unless relevant tax status information    is provided distributions to you may also be subject to withholding to the extent they are attributable to the sale of a us real property interest or if the distribution is otherwise considered fixed or determinable annual or periodic income under the internal revenue code provided that an exemption from or a reduced rate of such withholding may apply if certain tax status information is provided if such information is not provided and you would not be subject to us tax based on your tax status or are eligible for a reduced rate of us withholding you may need to take additional steps to receive a credit or refund of any excess withholding tax paid on your account which may include the filing of a nonresident us income tax return with the irs among other limitations if you reside in a treaty jurisdiction which does not treat our partnership as a passthrough entity you may not be eligible to receive a refund or credit of excess us withholding taxes paid on your account you should consult your tax advisors regarding the treatment of us withholding taxes special rules may apply in the case of a nonus holder that  has an office or fixed place of business in the us  is present in the us for  days or more in a taxable year or  is a former citizen of the us a foreign insurance company that is treated as holding a partnership interests in us in connection with their us business a pfic or a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid us federal income tax you should consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these special rules us federal estate tax consequences the us federal estate tax treatment of our common units with regards to the estate of a noncitizen who is not a resident of the united states is not entirely clear if our common units are includable in the us gross estate of such person then a us federal estate tax might be payable in connection with the death of such person prospective individual nonus holders who are noncitizens and not residents of the united states should consult their own tax advisors concerning the potential us federal estate tax consequences with regard to our units administrative matters taxable year we currently use the calendar year as our taxable year for us federal income tax purposes under certain circumstances which we currently believe are unlikely to apply a taxable year other than the calendar year may be required for such purposes tax matters partner our general partner acts as our tax matters partner as the tax matters partner the general partner has the authority subject to certain restrictions to act on our behalf in connection with any administrative or judicial review of our items of income gain loss deduction or credit information returns we have agreed to furnish to you as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of each calendar year tax information including schedule k which describes on a us dollar basis your share of our income gain loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year although we currently intend to distribute schedule ks on or around  days after the end of our fiscal year it may require longer than  days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lowertier entities so that ks may be prepared for us consequently holders of common units who are us taxpayers should anticipate that they may need to file annually with the irs and certain states a request for an extension past april  or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year in addition each partner will be required to report for all tax purposes consistently with the information provided by us for the taxable year    in preparing this information we will use various accounting and reporting conventions some of which have been mentioned in the previous discussion to determine your share of income gain loss and deduction the irs may successfully contend that certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible which could result in an adjustment to your income or loss we may be audited by the irs adjustments resulting from an irs audit may require you to adjust a prior years tax liability and possibly may result in an audit of your own tax return any audit of your tax return could result in adjustments not related to our tax returns as well as those related to our tax returns tax shelter regulations if we were to engage in a reportable transaction we and possibly you and others would be required to make a detailed disclosure of the transaction to the irs in accordance with recently issued regulations governing tax shelters and other potentially taxmotivated transactions a transaction may be a reportable transaction based upon any of several factors including the fact that it is a type of tax avoidance transaction publicly identified by the irs as a listed transaction or that it produces certain kinds of losses in excess of  million an investment in us may be considered a reportable transaction if for example we recognize certain significant losses in the future in certain circumstances a common unitholder who disposes of an interest in a transaction resulting in the recognition by such holder of significant losses in excess of certain threshold amounts may be obligated to disclose its participation in such transaction our participation in a reportable transaction also could increase the likelihood that our us federal income tax information return and possibly your tax return would be audited by the irs certain of these rules are currently unclear and it is possible that they may be applicable in situations other than significant loss transactions moreover if we were to participate in a reportable transaction with a significant purpose to avoid or evade tax or in any listed transaction you may be subject to i significant accuracyrelated penalties with a broad scope ii for those persons otherwise entitled to deduct interest on federal tax deficiencies nondeductibility of interest on any resulting tax liability and iii in the case of a listed transaction an extended statute of limitations common unitholders should consult their tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation under the regulations governing tax shelters with respect to the dispositions of their interests in us constructive termination subject to the electing large partnership rules described below we will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a month period our termination would result in the close of our taxable year for all holders of common units in the case of a holder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending on our yearend the closing of our taxable year may result in more than  months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the holders taxable income for the year of termination we would be required to make new tax elections after a termination including a new tax election under section  of the internal revenue code if applicable a termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred moreover a termination might either accelerate the application of or subject us to any tax legislation enacted before the termination elective procedures for large partnerships the internal revenue code allows large partnerships to elect streamlined procedures for income tax reporting this election would reduce the number of items that must be separately stated on the schedules k that are issued to the common unitholders and such schedules k would have to be provided to common    unitholders on or before the first march  following the close of each taxable year in addition this election would prevent us from suffering a technical termination which would close our taxable year if within a month period there is a sale or exchange of  percent or more of our total interests it is possible we might make such an election if eligible if we make such election irs audit adjustments will flow through to holders of the common units for the year in which the adjustments take effect rather than the holders of common units in the year to which the adjustment relates in addition we rather than the holders of the common units individually generally will be liable for any interest and penalties that result from an audit adjustment treatment of amounts withheld if we are required to withhold any us tax on distributions made to any common unitholder we may pay such withheld amount to the irs that payment if made will be treated as a distribution of cash to the common unitholder with respect to whom the payment was made and will reduce the amount of cash to which such common unitholder would otherwise be entitled withholding and backup withholding for each calendar year we will report to you and the irs the amount of distributions we made to you and the amount of us federal income tax if any that we withheld on those distributions the proper application to us of rules for withholding under section  of the internal revenue code applicable to certain dividends interest and similar items is unclear because the documentation we receive may not properly reflect the identities of partners at any particular time in light of possible sales of common units we may overwithhold or underwithhold with respect to a particular holder of common units for example we may impose withholding remit that amount to the irs and thus reduce the amount of a distribution paid to a nonus holder it may turn out however the corresponding amount of our income was not properly allocable to such holder and the withholding should have been less than the actual withholding such holder would be entitled to a credit against the holders us tax liability for all withholding including any such excess withholding but if the withholding exceeded the holders us tax liability the holder would have to apply for a refund to obtain the benefit of the excess withholding similarly we may fail to withhold on a distribution and it may turn out the corresponding income was properly allocable to a nonus holder and withholding should have been imposed in that event we intend to pay the underwithheld amount to the irs and we may treat such underwithholding as an expense that will be borne by all partners on a pro rata basis since we may be unable to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the relevant nonus holder under the backup withholding rules you may be subject to backup withholding tax at the rate of  with respect to distributions paid unless  you are a corporation or come within another exempt category and demonstrate this fact when required or  you provide a taxpayer identification number certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules if you are an exempt holder you should indicate your exempt status on a properly completed irs form w a nonus holder may qualify as an exempt recipient by submitting a properly completed irs form wben backup withholding is not an additional tax the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to you will be allowed as a credit against your us federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund if you do not timely provide us or the clearing agent or other intermediary as appropriate with irs form w or w as applicable or such form is not properly completed we may become subject to us backup withholding taxes in excess of what would have been imposed had we received certifications from all investors such excess us backup withholding taxes may be treated by us as an expense that will be borne by all investors on a pro rata basis since we may be unable to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the holders that failed to timely provide the proper us tax certifications    additional withholding requirements under legislation enacted in  as well as final regulations and other administrative guidance the relevant withholding agent may be required to withhold  of any interest dividends and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains profits and income from sources within the united states paid after june   or gross proceeds from the sale of any property of a type which can produce interest or dividends from sources within the united states occurring after december   paid to i a foreign financial institution for which purposes includes foreign brokerdealers clearing
