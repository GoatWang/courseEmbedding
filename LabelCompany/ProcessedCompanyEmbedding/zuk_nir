alto networks’ nir zuk says using cisco could soon get you fired keith griffithdecember   pm ptafter quitting juniper in  — leaving behind millions in unvested stock options — nir zuk cofounded the fast growing network security firm palo alto networks earlier this month zuk sat down with us in manhattan to discuss security virtualization cloud security and why chief information security officers cisos might soon rethink their dedication to cisco palo alto has been expanding its product line from hardware firewalls to softwareonly virtual firewalls what are the limitations with a virtualized firewall related articles top players in the container ecosystem you should knowwhat does cisco’s intentbased networking actually dosdxcentral weekly news roundup — july   does aws plan to battle google using kubernetes sponsored zuk in my opinion — by the way if you talk to vmware they’ll have the same opinion — protecting northtosouth traffic is going to continue to be physicalfirewall based we’re talking about tens of gigabits per second the most costeffective way of doing that is with physical firewalls now easttowest traffic is a different thing the most efficient way you can see traffic running easttowest in the data center is using virtualized firewalls the challenge with that traditionally has been performance the more modern firewalls and the other security devices they deal with content to deal with content efficiently you need hardware usually so that’s been my challenge how fast can the best virtual firewall get today zuk with all our functionality turned on running on appropriate number of intel cpu cores we can achieve about  gbs which is good by the way if you take a hardware device from one of our competitors — without mentioning any names the one that that’s based in israel — and you take a third rack device it’s called the  fully populated it’s probably  to  million and if you turn on all the functionality on it it will run at  mbs so our virtual firewalls are faster than some of our competitors’ physical firewalls that still doesn’t help the customer if they need more than a gigabit or two which is relatively rare usually if you look at easttowest traffic coming out of a single vm it’s usually not in a gbs level are those speed limitations a problem as enterprises shift to the cloud zuk most enterprises haven’t shifted to cloud not even internally meaning not even to a private cloud today everyone that builds a virtual data center calls it a private cloud it’s not a cloud for me a cloud a private cloud or a public cloud is a virtualized data center where each cpu each core can run any software at any time and it’s the controller that decides what one wears and all the cores and all the memory and all the storage is available at any given time to run anything most enterprises are not there most enterprises that i talk to are still mostly because of security running their data centers in a way where hardware is still dedicated for different functions it’s running in vms but still oracle will always run on the same physical servers the web servers will always run on the same server and their sap will always run on the same server you released the new vmseries firewall for amazon web services in october though so you must see that shift to public cloud coming is that a threat or opportunity for your market share zuk when you secure a public cloud you need to do the same thing you need to look at your easttowest traffic in the public cloud you need to look at your northtosouth traffic in the public cloud i think the only difference between the public cloud and private cloud is going to be the north to south traffic has to be done in in virtual firewalls or virtual security devices as well because amazon and others are not going to let you deploy a physical device but the way we price things we don’t care that much if you buy a physical firewall for your private cloud or a bunch of virtual firewalls for your public northtosouth you still need them how is demand so far for the aws firewall zuk the aws has been released very very recently so i don’t think we can talk about trends there i know that other vendors that have been trying to sell on aws for a long time haven’t been doing well is that because they have junky products or because the market’s not there zuk we don’t know yet we’ll see it’s either because of the product or maybe because most customers on aws are still not the large enterprises that are willing to spend money on security time will tell we are seeing a good demand for our virtual firewall running on vmware nsx in private cloud deployment about that vmware partnership — they have put a lot of focus on microsegmentation which seems like it does some of the things that palo alto would normally do are you almost in competition with their microsegmentation zuk no vmware’s microsegmentation is based mostly on network segmentation and very rudimentary access control our solution is segmenting things at the security level when i say network segmentation what i mean is that a cannot talk to b or a can talk to b you do this using vlans right you put different vms on different vlans and if they’re on the same vlan they can talk to each other if they’re not on the same vlan there’s access control at least vmware has been doing it forever and i think what they heard from their customers is that their customers wanted much more what they wanted to do is segment things using a security device meaning not just segment them on whether a can talk to b or a cannot talk to b but more about when a talks to b what’s okay for a and b to be talking about so a more granular level of control zuk more granular control and also looking at the content and making sure that the content is not harmful that’s not something that vmware solutions were doing which is why they partnered with us and why they’re selling our our virtual firewall to their customers as part of nsx the pa is your new highperformance hardware firewall is that something that can handle these hyperscale data centers the googles and facebooks zuk that product is not aimed at that market not because of scale but because of functionality if you look at what internetfacing data centers require they usually require very very basic security at the network level if you are a google or you are a facebook or you are much smaller company with internet presence what you really want to do is to allow outside clients to access your web servers and only your web servers you don’t need a sophisticated firewall to do that and they don’t buy sophisticated firewalls to do that the  and our other products are aimed more at the corporate data center which is by the way a much bigger market than those mega data centers because almost every company has a corporate data center — whether internally or some of them now may be moving to the cloud but you still have a corporate data center you’ve quit two jobs at check point and juniper to go your own way and start your own company what’s been the biggest surprising frustration of having your own company zuk i think we’re doing well we just announced a  million billing quarter growing  yearoveryear check point is at what  million or so so do the math when you went public in  was there any feeling of giving up control feeling like the pension fund managers are your bosses now zuk not yet i think that as long as the company’s doing well and it’s growing and the financials are good then they’re happy we went public at  we did a secondary at  i think and we’re at a hundred and … i don’t know i didn’t check this morning it’s not open yet here you have to wait on the east coast the stock was at  late monday so the shareholders are happy — i would hope so what are the biggest changes you think we’ll see in the security field next year zuk i think  is going to be probably the year when the rubber hits the road in the sense that we’re going to find out what works and what doesn’t work in terms of products i am finding myself more and more involved in conversations with security professionals or maybe “professionals” with quotes who insist on sticking to their existing security solutions that they’ve had for  years without any real rationale behind it i think that worked okay in  you cannot get fired for using cisco i think in  you’ll be fired for using cisco if you get hacked i don’t think that’s going to work that’s what i mean when i say that i think that the rubber is going to hit the road i think that it security organizations will have to start securing their networks not just make it appear as if they are securing their networks about keith griffithkeith
