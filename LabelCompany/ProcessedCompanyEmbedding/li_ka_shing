board form concrete curtain wall terracotta rain screen stainless metal shingles aluminum sunshades and includes multiple green roofs on three different levels many of these finishes contributed points towards leed and in combination with the high efficiency mep systems allowed the project to achieve leed gold certification beyond the finishes and building systems li kashing is situated at the main entry point for all pedestrian and vehicular traffic entering the campus from the downtown berkeley area which required extensive coordination between mccarthy uc berkeley and the city of berkeley for the duration of the construction process mccarthy led an integrated project team approach to develop a plan that allowed construction to start immediately without having the entire project funded or the interior designed there were many challenges during this phased approach including  clashes which were detected and resolved a construction area locked in on three sides by underground buildings and surrounded at the mouth of campus by thousands of students and a very complex exterior skin system the team used d capabilities of bim and virtual coordination to solve issues and streamline communication despite the challenges the team worked hard to keep everyone safe control costs and to deliver a highquality product ahead of schedule mr li kashing and our
