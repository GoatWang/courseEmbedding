larry swedroe moneywatch october    am why to be wary of managed futures funds comment share tweet stumble email moneywatch a recent bloomberg news article on a managed futures fund managed by morgan stanley caught the attention of my colleague kevin grogan the article describes how several managed futures funds offered through a limited partnership structure charged fees that were so high that they wiped out any gain for the investor managed futures are alternative investments that performed well in  when equities and most other alternative strategies did poorly unfortunately this good past performance made investors ripe for pitches for complicated opaque highfee managed futures funds here is a summary of the highlights or lowlights of these strategies cited in the article the morgan stanley smith barney spectrum technical lp fund made  million in trading gains and income from  to  however these profits did not accrue to the investors who bore all the risks instead morgan stanley and the fund managers made  million in commissions expenses and fees according to the sec  percent of the  billion of gains in  managed futures funds went to fees commissions and expenses from  to  brokers who sell these products have an incentive to keep clients in managed futures funds because they receive commissions annually of up to  percent of assets invested investors pay as much as  percent in total fees each year the prospectus of some of these funds allow their managers to make side bets by trading ahead or opposite the funds trades  a clear conflict of interest and a red flag if ever there was one ken steben the manager of a managed futures fund marketed by wells fargo and ameriprise made a shocking admission most individual investors dont understand what were doing in many cases the financial advisers dont completely understand it three important takeaways for investors fees matter clearly managed futures strategies delivered on their promise  gross of fees unfortunately the only returns investors can spend are net of fees and expenses including taxes beware of conflicts of interest the brokers who sold these strategies were heavily incented to do so also the fact that fund managers are allowed to frontrun or trade opposite their own funds trades is a huge red flag warren buffet once advised to never invest in a business you cant understand this

result in substantial losses to the partnership through its direct investments and investment in secor master fund while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of  the partnerships investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets other than the risks inherent in commodity futures forward options swaps and other derivatives trading and us treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities the partnership knows of no trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity

on trading and by expenses interest income redemptions of units and distributions of profit if any for the three months ended march   partnership capital decreased  from  to  this decrease was attributable to redemptions of  limited partner units totaling  coupled with a net loss of  future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods other than as discussed above there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period the general partner believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates the partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the financial statements the partnership and secor master fund record all investments at fair value in their financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains

trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and option markets aspect trades the allocated portion of the partnerships assets in accordance with its diversified program a proprietary systematic trading system the diversified program is a proprietary systematic global futures trading program its goal is the generation of significant longterm capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns this program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial currency and commodity markets searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months aspect has designed the diversified program to have broad market diversification subject to liquidity constraints aspects quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets aspects diversified program trades in over  markets in the seven major sectors currencies energy metals stock indices bonds agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its rewardrisk ratio and capacity aspect has no market or sector preferences believing that allowing for liquidity effects equal profitability can be achieved in the longterm in all markets the key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity correlations are analyzed at the sector subsector economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified campbell trades the allocated portion of the partnerships assets in accordance with its financial metal energy large portfolio a proprietary systematic trading program campbells trading models are designed to detect and exploit mediumterm to longterm price changes while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles campbell believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded every trading model may not trade every market it is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market it is campbells intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading but if the signals are not simultaneous both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable in retrospect one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary it is campbells policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models secors investment objectives are to generate high riskadjusted returns by fort trades the allocated portion of the partnerships assets in accordance with its global contrarian program a systematic technical trendanticipating trading program global contrarians investment objective is to achieve attractive absolute returns and reduced volatility of returns primarily through trading a broad spectrum of futures contracts including contracts on shortterm interest rates bonds currencies stock indices energy and metals global contrarian generally seeks to anticipate and capitalize on shorttointermediateterm trends two to six weeks unlike a trendfollowing program which would attempt to identify existing trends global contrarian attempts to anticipate trends before they occur global contrarian takes positions while the market is moving against the signal as a result its performance can be much more volatile than traditional trendfollowing models but the potential for diversification is much greater in an attempt to reduce the volatility of returns the allocation of capital is geographically diversified across asia europe australia and north america fort exercises little or no discretion over the rulebased and computerized trading signals generated by global contrarian global contrarian uses bayesian learning techniques to systematically adjust model parameters markets and sectors the learning process favors both winners and losers for allocations for example markets that underperform recently but perform well over the longterm are candidates for allocation

in accordance with its diversified program a proprietary systematic trading system the diversified program trades approximately  futures and forward contracts on us and nonus exchanges and markets winton employed a fully systematic computerized technical trendfollowing trading system developed by its principals this system tracks the daily price movements from these markets around the world and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be in an attempt to maximize profit within a certain range of risk if rising prices in a particular market are anticipated a long position will be established in that market if prices in a particular market are expected to fall a short position in that market will be established the following chart sets

   the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three months ended march   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership and secor

surged as data from the energy information agency showed us crude oil production continued to decline additional losses were recorded during august from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied amid speculation that crude producers would revive talks to stabilize prices at informal opec discussions in september within the global stock index sector losses were incurred during june from long positions in pacific rim equity index futures as prices declined on mounting uncertainties following the uks decision to leave the european union additional losses were incurred during january from long positions in european equity index futures as prices declined amid investor concerns about declining oil prices and a chinaled slowdown in global growth within the

income futures as prices advanced after weakness in chinese economic data revived concern about the stability of the global economy additional gains were experienced during june from long positions in european fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the uks vote in late june to leave the european union increased demand for the

exchangerate cap which maintained a minimum exchangerate for the swiss franc against the euro within the global interest rate sector losses were incurred primarily during february from long positions
