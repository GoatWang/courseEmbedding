“the world’s most creative ceo” how many chief executives sketch out product designs as a form of relaxation and engagement how many meet with street artists and collect their work not simply for personal pleasure but to evolve their understanding of our global cultureparker and i had dinner after my first generation flux feature and he encouraged me to continue the thread of coverage so i reached out to him when i embarked on the second installmentbusiness at the speed of swoosh“things are accelerating” parker says “but it’s not as if we’re in a speedup slowdown world it’s a highvelocity world we’re digitally connected everything is changing”this type of climate he contends fits into nike’s longtime culture “our management approach hasn’t come from studying and reading business books it’s more intuitive from the culture of sports we’re constantly looking for ways to improve how do you adapt to your environment and really focus on your potential to really go after that you have to embrace the reality that it is not going to slow down and you have to look at that as half full not half empty”“companies and people look at the pace of change as a challenge an obstacle a hurdle” parker notes “we like to look at it as opportunity get on the offense”advertisementhow to be goliath in a david marketi asked parker if being a big organization was a disadvantage in an era of rapid change “i don’t think it’s true that size by definition limits adaptability flexibility” he says “we’re a big global brand we have great resources we break the business into definable subsets based on different consumer cultures and go deep to be meaningful and relevant to them”but he acknowledges that size can have complications “at a big company often size turns into constipation it fogs the lens about what’s really happening sometimes with size and success comes the notion that since we’ve done things to be successful we have the formula and can institutionalize it that can be death”“you have to challenge what’s worked” parker observes “if we said okay we have the formula for design and manufacturing footwear–that’s a myopic and shortterm view” they would never have then pursued flyknit a new nike technology that allows shoes to be sewn from thread instead of cut from sections of fabric “one of the challenges of innovation is challenging a set model a traditional way to manufacture footwear existed for hundreds of years now we have a whole new way”aren’t there people within an organization that resist changing “it’s natural for people to be comfortable the way things are” parker says “my job our job is to not close the mind with flyknit i was very involved you look at the potential–it could be game changing–you encourage it it creates momentum”topdown vs bottomupat nike parker says “it’s a mix traditional hierarchic topdown is archaic it’s just not real on the other side everything is not bubbleup that ratio topdown to bubbleup will shift based on situations i’m a big believer that there’s no one single approach”“sometimes you need to go hard and fast” he allows “and from the top we can make that happen ideas may come from the bottom up but the direction and support can go topdown” parker looks for bottomup ideas by walking the halls at nike “i’ll see something on corner of someone’s desk and ask ‘what’s that’ all of a sudden a new thing is on the priority list”advertisement“you have to be open to ideas from different parts of the company from different parts of the world the biggest sources of opportunity are collaboration and partnership and today with digital communication there is more of that everywhere we need to expose ourselves to that as a matter of doing business”making choices from infinite possibilities“that’s one of the greatest challenges” parker admits “we are an idearich organization never have i seen more opportunity how do you pick you don’t always pick the right things you have to edit out”parker has a term he uses to describe the requirement edit and amplify “the ability to edit and amplify is so critical it is consuming for me the choices we need to make in every part of our business” earlier this year parker noted that nike’s rd group had  ideas being explored he recognized that the number was too high “we had too many projects some are clearly more important than others” so he pushed the group to make some hard choices he got personally involved–not specifically selecting projects but working with the rd team to set up criteria to evaluate “what are the things we want to accomplish how do these rate against those criteria” they cut the idea list down to “there’s a real discipline to this” parker says “it’s going to sound bureaucratic but it’s not there’s a difference between discipline and bureaucracy”“you can’t always predict the winners” he continues “i end up asking a lot of questions so the team thinks things through i don’t say ‘do this do that’ i’m not a micromanager i don’t believe in that my father when i was growing up would say to me when i had to make a decision ‘well what do you think’ and i’d say ‘well i think this’ and he’d say ‘that seems like a good idea’ and over time i started picking for myself i didn’t need to go to him at nike we have incredibly strong people they know what to do”how to model a modern leadership team“you don’t need to be here four or five years to have great ideas heard i go out and seek ideas from lower parts of company maybe a new designer fresh out of school sometimes its good to see raw ideas at a basic level i like to pull that out put it in the spotlight celebrate that ideas come from everywhere there’s real value to show everyone in the company that you can make a difference in many cases things that happened off the grid have become a massive success” parker’s own career was elevated by what he calls “a little side project” the idea of “visible air” or nike air as you likely know it which drove massive value for nike for many years a more recent example he notes is nike’s line of free footwear which also came out of a side project “now it’s a billiondollar franchise” parker notesadvertisementparker recognizes that perfection is not possible in a world of flux “we’re not always right” he says with a laugh but as long as they go with change instead of fighting it parker says the company moves in the right direction “we try to help accelerate the change ourselves” he explains “if you get that it’s an opportunity you’ll want to” he repeats his early exhortation “play offense”advertisementrelated storiesleadershipfour worklife questions to ponder on vacation this summerleadershipwhy telling john mccain to beat cancer feeds a dangerous gop narrativeleadershipkicking

teenage marathoner he routinely modified his own running shoes in search of better performance now the designs he once called his “delicate creations” are so deeply embedded in the success of the company that he’s lost track of the number of patents he holds one is for visible air technology which he created as a side project it helped catapult nike out of the doldrums in the mid’s john mcenroe kobe bryant olympic athletes and your highschool’s crosscountry star — he’s shod them all bryant fresh from the lakers’ playoff victory and his mvp award in june describes meeting parker then nike copresident in  and watching him whip out his notebook to sketch while they talked “i knew right from that that we were on the same page” bryant says “he’s not doing things just for innovation’s sake he truly wants to optimize my performance”parker isn’t an attentionseeking sort of ceo so until now it has been hard to get a sense of him but the imprint he is making as ceo is turning out to be as meaningful as his design work putting his stamp on nike as forcefully as the much splashier cofounder phil knight did parker has reorganized the company into units based on particular sports “a conscious decision to sharpen each piece of the business so we’re not some big fat dumb company” he says reshuffled its regions to put new emphasis on china and japan streamlined the reporting process

what we learn from them is who we are” he says mark parker collector ceo cobbler to the godsparker is sitting in on a product meeting in nike’s secretive innovation kitchen a think tank for designers where athletic ambition art and a bit of mad science are cooked into the stuff that has made nike the dominant player in sport shoes and apparel the kitchen is a freerange creative playpen with every type of tool material machine toy instrument software game and inspirational image at the ready nike free the training shoe that mimics the benefits of running barefoot was born here so was flywire the ultralight thread system inspired by a suspension bridge that has changed the way shoes are constructed the kitchen is so secure that most employees aren’t allowed in the kitchen and its earlier rd iterations are also where parker spent most of his time before he became ceo “i think his heart is still here” says michael donaghu director of footwear innovation “he still likes to just pop in and start talking to people about stuff that’s on their desks particularly their side projects he can’t help himself”on the table in front of parker is an abundant display of shoes sandals gear and what might be a digital etch a sketch that you stand on at the head of the room under a drape waits a shiny prototype of a new imagetransfer gizmo that will allow the swift customization of shoes at retailers and special events unveiled it lurches to life after a few false starts a mildly acrid smell fills the room as the machine’s mother shyly explains the process and affixes some art to a sneaker “it looks like the fortuneteller machine from big” someone jokes it does parker and the team applaud goodnaturedly when the demo actually works although the alarm on his watch prompts him to leave after an hour parker continues to listen raptly to each presenter asking questions and studying their wares afterward as i continue the kitchen tour i spot him now very late perched on the desk of a designer chatting happily and poking through a pile of midsoles and uppers “i told you” says donaghuthough parker later tells us that not everything he saw at the meeting will get a green light he’s careful not to shut people down at meetings “i prefer to let people share what they’re working on and i don’t like to embarrass anyone” he repeats a mantra i hear early and often edit and amplify “i’m trying to amplify the innovation agenda further and shortlist the things that will make the biggest difference that’s an art and a science”back in  phil knight passed over parker for the top spot bringing in an outsider william perez from sc johnson it was a move that was widely misread as a snub “it didn’t upset me” says parker who was part of the team that vetted ceo candidates “it wouldn’t be honest to say that i didn’t think about it though i trust and respect phil so i decided to learn from it” knight explains that he thought it was time for an outside look “i’d been ceo for almost  years the company worked around my idiosyncracies so much that they didn’t know that they were idiosyncracies anymore” but nike’s unique culture chewed up perez in less than  months sandy bodecker now vp of nike global design was so unhappy on parker’s behalf that he says he “made a vow never to actually meet the guy” they once presented on the same stage — perez exiting left as bodecker entered right they even stood shoulder to shoulder at the urinals in the men’s room “i chose not to introduce myself” bodecker smirks ultimately knight says “yeah it was a mistake we’re not for everyone”parker came by nike honestly the way that all the early employees got there as a “running puke” — “even more extreme than a running geek” he says — lured by the siren song of an unlimited supply of revolutionary shoes in the mid’s he was a champion runner for penn state part of what was then one of the most scientifically managed trackandfield programs in the country at foot parker brushed the scales at  pounds “i looked like a praying mantis” he says he customized his own shoes by cutting the soles and experimenting with foam and homemade sock liners he turned ironically to sheets of nikemade wafflesole material that he got from local shoesupply shops “i might run in an asics tiger shoe and put a waffle bottom on it” he says “the cushioning was so much better” he sounds wistful as he recalls his first pair of nikes he got them by mail order “waffle trainers red with the white swoosh i put them on and …” he trails offadvertisementthe fourth of seven kids parker grew up in a busy household in stamford connecticut his father was a lifelong ibm engineer his mother a psychiatric nurse “i was a pretty independent kid” he says but not particularly artistic “i thought maybe i’d be a veterinarian or an environmental lawyer” after he graduated from penn state in  — he majored in political science because “i had to pick something” — he was hired by jeff johnson nike employee no  and “took what was basically an avocation design and turned it into my life” he worked in the company’s dusty rd facility in exeter new hampshire testing products and enjoying the brotherhood of athletes cum shoe dogs trying to figure out what they and nike were going to be when they all grew up bodecker the now legendary codesigner of flywire was a broke ski racer in  looking to get his hands on cuttingedge training shoes when he agreed to try the only pair available twoandahalf sizes too small to get into parker’s testing program “i had no idea the shoes didn’t fit” says parker former pole vaulter tinker hatfield was working as an architect at nike when parker spied some sketches of shoes on his desk and pointed him toward rd hatfield is now the father of some of the most iconic shoes ever made including the air jordanparker’s own success at nike has had much to do with his philosophical alignment with the company’s other cofounder bill bowerman the very first cobbler to the gods in  years as track coach at the university of oregon in eugene bowerman had only one losing season and trained  olympic athletes subjecting his athletes to rigorous study in the service of making the perfect sneaker he famously cooked up shoe soles using his wife’s waffle iron his sketches brought to japanese manufacturers by his new partner and former student phil “buck” knight became the first nikes his quirky bespoke creations were worn by nike’s first famous elite athlete steve prefontaine the explosive three miler who broke all existing records before he broke hearts with his early death in bowerman was famous for brutalizing young designers bearing prototypes whipping out a scale and mocking the weight or construction he greeted interlopers from nike’s east coast outpost with rugged bluntness russia has siberia nike has exeter read a sign over his desk parker largely escaped bowerman’s wrath partly because he was an actual athlete but mostly because he was that good” i witnessed more of the brutality than felt it” says parker “there was no filter from his brain to his mouth i found it really refreshing to know what he was thinking” parker’s unusual ability to remain calm in the face of passionate exchanges has helped him thrive in an environment filled with highly competitive people driven to succeed but bowerman’s coaching technique — he created personalized training programs for each athlete unusual back then — informs parker’s management style to this day “i spend a good deal of time coaching executives now” he says “each person needs something different to succeed it’s a bowerman approach” he also mentions margaret wheatley author of leadership and the new science a meaty exploration of newtonian physics chaos theory and business “her premise is that the energy in an organization is a product of the relationships between people” — not creating an org chart and then putting people into the boxes which “i think is exactly backward”the ’s were a mixed bag for nike parker describes the early ’s as a frantic time with the company going through “some choppy water within a general industry malaise” knight puts it more starkly with net income down  year over year in  “reebok had just gone by us in a fairly big way” he says “it was serious we didn’t like that” and nike wasn’t the hightech rd emporium it is now when parker arrived from exeter’s siberia in  it was more of a shoe shop donaghu then a college runner interned for nike in  he remembers joining a small team that relied on mimeograph machines and still telexed handwritten instructions to the factories in asia “i finally brought my little apple that i used in college just for documents” he says “it was the first computer in the design part of nike”with reebok breathing down the the company’s neck darwinian battles were waged for resources and support while the company cast about for ideas parker hatfield bodecker and a few others hunkered down to skunkwork a new generation of shoes their nickname inside nike was the “speed group” but parker recalls “we also called ourselves the swat team” working under spartan conditions parker pulled off a miracle — a technology called visible air the concept was simple on paper take the cushioning element embedded in nike’s existing air series and cut a window in the sole so that people could actually understand the effect the trouble is the window kept popping “i was working on it as a side project” says parker along with developing a crosstraining shoe with hatfieldby  parker had a prototype ready and knight let him show it to the board in  a suite of shoes called air max — running and basketball models and parker and hatfield’s crosstraining shoe — debuted at a trade show to tremendous buzz “parker made a terrific product” knight says that same year nike teamed with ad agency wiedenkennedy to make a splashy ad called “revolution” set to the original beatles song the choppy fastcut blackandwhite commercial mixed images of everyday people and nike athletes and outraged beatles purists “but it really made a complete campaign” says knight “nike air relaunched the whole brand it was a huge moment for the company and for parker too”advertisementat the same time an unexpected audience for nike was developing hiphop artists djs designers and other influentials were using the shoes that parker and his team were creating to compete for nothing else than style points the air force one which arrived in  turned the heads of uptown scenesters “it looked different from any other basketball shoe white on white” says dan cherry currently the managing partner and director of brand strategy for the marketing firm anomaly while at wiedenkennedy cherry worked on the th anniversary of the iconic air force one then came the air jordan series in  the shoes were such a colorful deviation from the basketball norm that michael jordan was fined  by the nba for wearing them a cult following was born expertly stoked through marketing in  mars blackmon director spike lee’s alter ego started appearing in a funny series of ads starring michael jordan and directed by lee the next year lee referenced the fierce earnestness of sneaker culture in do the right thing when a character melts down after his spotless air jordan cement ivs are defiled by a clumsy celtics fan by the time jordan dazzled on the  olympic dream team the world wanted to be like mikethere was no one better poised to amplify the sneaker’s aesthetic appeal than parker “that was part of mark’s genius” says cherry parker found a natural source of inspiration in his artist network including graffiti artists stash and futura  artist and toy designer kaws and even rapper kanye west the company began churning out artist retakes of classic nike shoes all highly collectible deftly creating scarcity by meting out limited supply to small specialty stores and ultrahip fashion retailers parker’s own topshelf designs for htm a collaboration with hatfield and japanese designer hiroshi fujiwara can sell to collectors for as much as  a pair as the rich famous and fashionable began to sport colorful nikes clothing designers began to retool their collections to accommodate the sneakerhead lifestyle fashion designer alexander mcqueen owned  pairsthe relationships with artists that parker has built as a collector and fan have had an added benefit for the better part of this decade nike had been trying to make inroads into action sports particularly the highly insular skate market “our reps especially kept hearing from people that we couldn’t be relevant here” admits parker acquisitions — hurley for surfing in  and savier for skateboarding in  — were not enough “the momandpop specialty shops in particular had a tough time believing a big corporation had any business there and we struggled and it embarrassed me we weren’t authentic”to build credibility with skaters bodecker and parker tapped artists such as the los angeles graffitiandtattoodesign star known as mr cartoon to design limitededition shoes logos and apparel “i used to fly to japan in the ’s to buy the air forces and jordans you couldn’t get here” says ‘toon who has inked eminem  cent and christina aguilera “and now i make them” nike has allowed him to create a platform holding specialty events in the united states that advocate design and selfdiscovery to latino youth “we did  last year alone” he says os gêmeos twin brazilian street artists painted huge murals in europe for the  world cup for nike and created limited runs of shoes their work appeals to the very crowd nike is trying to impress no overpriced marketing grunt could pull off this kind of authenticity “it’s not the kind of thing where you say ‘get me something cool to debut for the tattoo community in the third quarter’ ” says cherry “mark gets the irreverent beauty of real artists and real subcultures”parker refuses to take credit for nike’s hipster appeal “i think it goes back to hayward field” he says referring to the early days when bowerman’s home track at the university was the best rd lab nike had “we used to make the wildestlooking shoes that you couldn’t buy” he recalls and people would crowd around the athletes as they queued up for a race to ask about their shoes to this day he says athletes understand the psychological advantage of the aesthetics of what they wear “it’s what people wanted then — to feel like they were special and that’s grown into a whole global culture”for all the hushhush design thinking and fashion lust its products generate nike has had some notsosecret problems among them disgraceful working conditions including child labor in the asian factories that produce the goods add on energy use and carbon inefficiency and the need for innovation is clear parker ticks off a laundry list of opportunities all related to design “materials componentry construction methods manufacturing methods the whole digital revolution knitting technology that allows you to make completely sustainable design and footwear without any cutting and stitching without any archaic manufacturing processes we’re embedding all that thinking into the product” but never at the expense of performance “the entire process becomes sustainable it’s not just a ‘green’ footwear line”advertisementhannah jones nike’s vice president of corporate responsibility is parker’s frontline commander sitting a few doors away and reporting directly to him her first audit discovered some  million a year in wasted materials working with parker and product designers jones and her team — which now numbers some  — examined all processes for efficiency toxicity energy impact and safety what has emerged is an evolving series of metrics the considered index that helps determine the environmental impact of each item nike makes the company is now focusing on the supplychain and manufacturing elements that impact working conditions in the  of its contractors’ factories that produce  of its goods by  parker has promised all shoes will meet a minimum standard “but it’s a neverending challenge” he says “there’s no finish line”nevertheless he is delighted that the index has inspired a new creative tension inside nike a software tool based on the index allows designers to see the environmental impact of their design choices and gives them a benchmark to shoot for they compete with one another as they work “we’re not creating a green product for the sake of doing it” he says “we’re creating a whole new way of design” and the company is sharing what it is learning in  nike debuted a sneaker without the toxic solvents long used to bind the sole to the shoe the formula for the new adhesive is now available through the green exchange that parker announced at the world economic forum in davos this year and in  after a decade and a half of research and millions of research dollars the company removed a greenhouse gas known as sf from its famous air pockets there was no announcementparker has become a visible champion for sustainable thinking and a quiet star at davos leading conversations with ceos from giants such as general mills kaiser permanente renaultnissan swiss re telstra — even facebook and hunch “populations are exploding emerging markets are getting more power” says parker disruptive change is on everyone’s mind “there’s this internalization of how critical it is to deal with sustainability as we’re out here trying to wave the flag it’s very satisfying to see that”“and why the blanketyblank are you now in the mp business” parker is telling stories at dinner this one about a call he got from apple’s steve jobs we are in a private dining room at one of parker’s favorite portland restaurants the waiter also a bit of a pal pops in periodically to check on us and to chat up parker the waiter has six marathons under his belt and he’s feeling hinky about the seventh “san francisco next month” he pauses “hills” he feigns a shudder parker smiles that his world shifts easily from waiters to mr cartoon to lance armstrong and back says a lot about the man he is open curious and wanting to connect with people doing their thing “you’ll do great” he says they talk strategyfacing jobs however parker conceded defeat nike had partnered with phillips in  to make an mp player that would help connect a runner with music and his or her own workout stats — distance speed calories and so on “nobody remembers it but it was a best seller at the time” says parker one look back at the online reviews explains why nobody remembers it jobs called parker and didn’t mince words “why are you doing this it’s not your core business” parker flew down to cupertino for a face to face what resulted from the meeting was nike a nifty sensor that goes in the bottom of a running shoe and feeds workout stats to an iphone or ipod and through social networks today says trevor edwards nike’s vp of marketing social features allow millions of people to feel they’re part of the planet’s largest running club “we now have  million members who have run  million miles” he says it took  months and nike spent a rumored  billion on the launchbut parker saves the best part of the story for last jobs — a new balance wearer who typically shows up for only his own product extravaganzas — joined parker onstage for the nike debut in  “oh he wore nikes” says parker he smilesadvertisementwhen the conversation turns to tiger woods though parker gets serious “i learned about it the way everyone else did” he says of the messy swirl that became woods’s downfall parker part of the nike fullcourt press that recruited woods as he turned pro clearly likes him “he sat right there” parker says pointing to my chair “i knew his dad” still when the news broke parker trod lightly “we made efforts to connect with him he went really quiet shut himself off from everybody so it was difficult”ultimately he says nike handles issues like this on a casebycase basis “what does what’s happening mean to what we should be doing and yes character also matters” but he says “we didn’t want to convict him through the media” and as woods reemerged into his professional life parker didn’t shy away nike released an ad with a silent and contemplative tiger and a voiceover from his nowdeceased father it was instantly polarizing “i knew that it would be controversial some people thought it was creepy” he says “it was the voice of the athlete and we’re committed to that”for parker the elite superstar may be the lab rat of choice to start the design process but his heart remains with the everyathlete paula radcliffe the british marathon star describes watching the ceo and his wife a worldclass runner who is now a highschool track coach at the national highschool crosscountry championships that nike hosts every year elite athletes are invited to race with the kids and spend the day mingling with them despite the rainy oregon day the parkers eschewed the vip tent “they were going wild and they seemed to know everyone by name” says radcliffe “they were as inspired by the kids as they were by any of us”“there’s a certain energy and purity and passion in the relationships between the parents kids and coaches and the love of team” parker says in their way these folks are as obsessed as a kobe or a radcliffe “it’s as important for me to be there as with record holders and olympians these are the people we’re serving”parker has made sure that
