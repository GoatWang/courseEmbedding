httppharmacytecomwpcontentuploadscellinaboxonsdmp pharmacyte’s research and development rd efforts are focused on developing therapies for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary cellulosebased livecell encapsulation technology known as “cellinabox®” this technology will be used as a platform upon which therapies for several types of cancer and diabetes are being developed  pharmacyte’s therapy for cancer involves encapsulating genetically engineered human cells that convert an inactive chemotherapy drug into its active or “cancerkilling” form these encapsulated cells are implanted as close to the patient’s cancerous tumor as possible  once implanted a chemotherapy drug that is normally activated in the liver ifosfamide is given intravenously at onethird the normal dose the ifosfamide is carried by the circulatory system to where the encapsulated cells have been implanted  when the ifosfamide comes in contact with the encapsulated cells those cells act as an artificial liver and activate the chemotherapy drug at the source of the cancer this “targeted chemotherapy” has proven effective and safe to use in past clinical trials also this novel form of chemotherapy results in no side effects in addition to developing a novel therapy for cancer pharmacyte is developing a treatment for type  diabetes and insulindependent type  diabetes pharmacyte plans to encapsulate a human cell line that has been genetically engineered to produce store and release insulin in response to the levels of blood sugar in the human body the encapsulation will be done using the cellinabox® technology once the encapsulated cells are implanted in a diabetic patient they will function as an “artificial pancreas” for purposes of insulin production our rd product pipeline is

biotechnology company developing therapies for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary cellulosebased live cell encapsulation technology known as “cellinabox®” this technology will be used as a platform upon which therapies for several types of cancer and diabetes are being developed pharmacyte’s therapy for cancer involves encapsulating genetically engineered human cells that convert an inactive chemotherapy drug into its active or “cancerkilling” form these encapsulated cells are implanted as close to the patient’s cancerous tumor as possible once implanted a chemotherapy drug that is normally activated in the liver ifosfamide is given intravenously at onethird the normal dose the ifosfamide is carried by the circulatory system to where the encapsulated cells have been implanted  when the ifosfamide comes in contact with the encapsulated cells they act as an artificial liver and activate the chemotherapy drug at the source of the cancer this “targeted chemotherapy” has proven effective and safe to use in past clinical trials moreover this novel form of chemotherapy results in no side effects in addition to developing a novel therapy for cancer pharmacyte is developing a treatment for type  diabetes and insulindependent type  diabetes pharmacyte plans to encapsulate a human cell line that has been genetically engineered to produce store and release insulin in response to the levels of blood sugar in the human body the encapsulation will be done using the cellinabox® technology once the encapsulated cells are implanted in a diabetic patient they will function as an “artificial pancreas” for purposes of insulin production pharmacyte is also developing a therapy for cancer based upon constituents of the cannabis plant known as “cannabinoids”  pharmacyte plans to combine the cellinabox® technology with cannabinoids to develop a unique therapy for difficulttotreat and deadly forms of cancer such as brain cancer  some cannabinoids are prodrugs that must be converted into their cancer killing form  these prodrugs will be used with the cellinabox® technology in ways that optimize their anticancer properties while minimizing or even eliminating adverse

last time we touched upon pharmacyte biotech inc otcmktspmcb here at street register was back in march when the company had no clear cut timeline for the filing process on its ind investigational new drug application for its upcoming clinical trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer lapc while it’s still a fluid process with several boxes to tick in terms of preparing for the application and study we did receive updates in the form of a company q  a this week that could shed some light on the story we always try to keep our readers abreast of any new press coming from the stocks we profile so we want to pass along some snippets from the q  a released by the company sarah demare the product development champion with facet life sciences and us agent for pharmacyte biotech inc otcmktspmcb was asked about several topics pertaining to the ind perhaps most importantly she was asked to list off some of the items that are standing between pmcb and filing of the application “the single most important item pharmacyte needed to learn from the fda at the preind meeting was the acceptability of pharmacyte’s proposed cell line without that understanding pharmacyte was unable to move forward with the manufacture of its product candidate for the lapc clinical trial”     “an ind encompasses many things dealing with the manufacture and characterization of the product candidate the clinical study design and nonclinical studies pharmacyte’s therapy for pancreas cancer has undergone or been part of several studies so incorporation of that information into the ind is not ‘rate limiting’ or ‘slowing down the progress towards submitting an ind’ the clinical study design that pharmacyte agreed to undertake after meeting with the fda is currently being drafted this is also not rate limiting to conduct the clinical trial pharmacyte will need to manufacture test and release a master cell bank a working cell bank and the encapsulated live cells this information is also required to be described and documented in detail in the ind  the manufacture of these items is the rate limiting factor involved in submitting the ind” “before the ind is filed the following items must be available for inclusion a  documentation of preclinical work done on the cells b  toxicology studies c  documentation of preclinical work done on the capsules themselves d  a wide array of cmc chemistry manufacturing and controls documentation that verifies that the final biologic product the encapsulated cells has been produced under current good manufacturing practices cgmpcompliant conditions e  labeling for the final investigational biologic product f  previous evidence of human experience with the pancreas cancer therapy lowdose ifosfamide plus cellinabox® encapsulated

killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to

progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our

thrive helping diabetes patients thrive share tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes
