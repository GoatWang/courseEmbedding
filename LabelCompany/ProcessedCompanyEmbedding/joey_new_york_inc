joey new york a paid promotion which wont pay  joey new york inc otcmktsjoey  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»joey new york a paid promotion which wont payfeb  about joey new joey hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummaryjoey new york is a paid stock promotionover  of the stock is owned by insidersthe companys financials are inconsistent with what the promotion claimsjoey stock does not currently have an active marketbackground following the close of the market on february   a series of promotional emails from penny picks damngood pennypicks and beatpennystocks were sent out encouraging investors to purchase the common stock of joey new york inc otcqbjoey citing that the company has major upside and is on the verge of completing a major acquisition however if one reads through the companys financial statements its clear that the paid promotion is intended to create a market for a third party to sell its shares not to inform investors of a fantastic investment opportunity business joey new york inc is a company that distributes cosmetics from the companys k it reads the company through its wholly owned subsidiary rar beauty llc doing business under the name joey new york distributes natural skin care and beauty products on wholesale and retail levels the companys headquarters is based in sunny isles beach florida the company seeks to increase market share and introduce its product line through multiple channel markets the company faces competition from nationally recognized firms that may have greater resources of personnel capitalization and reputation the company has therefore concentrated its efforts on product quality and performance joey new york product lines include skin care treatments and beauty enhancements that are health conscious effective and affordable in keeping with our beauty mission we have utilized the water from tender young green coconuts blended with indian ginseng extract into our new fastacting quick results skincare collection sounds relatively straightforward  they distribute cosmetics however if one goes back a few years in the companys filings you can see that the company was formerly called pronto corporation but was renamed on september   in conjunction with a  for  stock split at the time of the final q as pronto july   the company was defined as a shell ive always been wary of splits and name changes in microcap stocks and this one is no exception if you look at the companys most recent k it states that there are only three employees in the company which seems a very small staff for a company that claims to be engaged in the distribution of products on the retail and wholesale level financials from the latest q the companys balance sheet shows that the company has just under  in cash while its cash flow statement shows that it went through nearly  in cash in the first nine months of  ending november  additionally the company has an accumulated deficit of  million given the companys burn rate  is not going to be enough to continue to run the business on and the companys current market cap of  million just doesnt seem justified apparently the companys auditors agree as they have issued a going concern note in the companys q which reads for the nine month period ended november   the company has incurred a loss from operations of  the company has a history of losses resulting in an accumulated deficit the company has negative working capital in the amount of  as of november   the company intends to fund operations and continuing product development through debt and equity financing arrangements which efforts may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements the company cannot be certain that it will be successful in its efforts to attain such capital or that the terms of capital will be at acceptable terms these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty indicating that the companys accounting firm recognizes that the company is in poor financial shape and that the company is likely going to issue equity in order to stay afloat i expect to see some ks in the future that make note of a private placement or possibly an s for the issuance of more shares promotion as mentioned previously joey has been the subject of a paid promotion which went out on february th following the close of the market the promotion stated in part the company is working on a major acquisition the target company is making over  million a year in sales something joey is keen to bring into its already strong operational setup given that joey has only about  in the bank and not given any other details this proposition doesnt really make any sense  beyond the issue that sales dont necessarily correlate to profitability the numbers just dont scale i dont see how any company that brings in over  million in revenue will be bought out for less than  there are other claims that encourage potential investors to look at joey but what is really important is the disclaimer at the bottom of the advertisement the disclaimer which reads this newsletter is a paid advertisement not a recommendation nor an offer to buy or sell securities this newsletter is owned operated and edited by stellar media group llc…stellar medias business model is to receive financial compensation to promote public companies we have been compensated twenty thousand dollars cash via bank wire by a third party otp group llc to conduct investor relations advertising and marketing for joey this compensation is a major conflict of interest in our ability to be unbiased regarding therefore this communication should be viewed as a commercial advertisement only we have not investigated the background of the hiring third party or parties the third party profiled company or their affiliates likely wish to liquidate shares of the profiled company at or near the time you receive this communication which has the potential to hurt share prices… this promotional email hit my inbox just after the market closed on february th indicating that its purpose is to create a market on the following day given that the average daily volume of joey common stock is about  shares and that the promoters paid over twenty thousand dollars its pretty clear that there is not currently a big market for joey stock  sending out the promotion looks like it is intended to generate investor interest in order to create a sizeable enough market for otp or its clients to sell its shares insider ownership from the companys most recent k  of the shares are owned by officers or directors of the company which makes me even more wary of this promotion while there is no mention of otp group llc in the companys recent filings i think that it would speak well for management if they could clarify whether there is a relationship between this entity or not a google search for otp group llc yields a linkedin page for the company where it describes itself as otp group is a smallcap research investor relations and media company headquartered in new york city with affiliate offices in texas and florida otp group specializes in delivering concrete measurable results for its clients through its extensive global network of smallcap institutional and retail investors the otp team has developed the most comprehensive platform of products and services for smallcap companies which includes research reports retail and institutional marketing institutional and retail road shows ceo audio interviews the otp report featuring smallcap companies shareholder intelligence strategic marketing crisis management social media and blogging services so the third party paying for the promotion looks to be working on behalf of its undisclosed clients but is probably not a major shareholder itself as it is not a named shareholder this was surprising and pretty interesting  usually when there is a paying third party listed in the disclaimer section of an ad searches yield nothing but here we actually know who is paying for the promotion conclusion i am always wary of promoted stocks and joey new york is no exception it has poor financials which merit a going concern note from its auditors and has a market cap that seems unjustified by its balance sheet and cash flow furthermore because of its financial situation investors can expect dilution in the form of equity issuances additionally there is substantial insider ownership and the third party paying for the promotion is clearly working on behalf of major shareholders while there is no definitive link between the insiders and the paying entity it would not surprise me at all if management was paying to have the stock promoted so that they could unload some of their shares if you are considering taking a long position in joey think again  this company has too many red flags to make it a suitable longterm investment im not going anywhere near this one disclosure the author has no

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
