by wikileaks stated senator gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported spanish judiciary desire to indict six former bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework

jurisdiction in such cases senator mel martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed martinez noted that the prosecutions would neither be understood

and that there was no political influence on the judicial process in an earlier cable days before the senators arrived a us diplomat commented we do not know if the spanish government would be willing

thats not likely and i wouldnt expect to be doing that” he added the spanish justice system and guantanamo bayedit main article the bush six in april  senator gregg was sent to accompany an american diplomat to speak with a spanish diplomat luis felipe fernández de la peña after a war crimes case was filed by spanish ngo association for the dignity of spanish prisoners at the audiencia nacional of spain accusing them of crimes in iraq and guantanamo bay the case targeted six former us government officials for allegedly violating the geneva convention the  convention against torture and the  rome statute the six accused were alberto gonzales david addington william haynes douglas feith jay bybee and john yoo a summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by wikileaks stated senator gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported spanish judiciary desire to indict six former bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture fernandez de la pena lamented this development adding that judicial independence notwithstanding the ministry of foreign affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases senator mel martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed martinez noted that the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the us and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship spanish foreign minister angel lossada retorted the national court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process in an earlier cable days before the senators arrived a us diplomat commented we do not know if the spanish government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutors recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be controversiesedit in the senate gregg was the leading republican negotiator and author of the tarp program which bailed out financial institutions while he had a multimilliondollar investment in bank of america after leaving the senate gregg became an advisor to the investment bank goldman sachs in february  the associated press reported that gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the pease air force base in portsmouth new hampshire into an industrial park according to senate records gregg has collected from  to  from his investments in pease air force base while helping to arrange at least  million in federal aid for the former base gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the commerce secretary was unrelated to the white houses discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his familys real estate investments in pease gregg explained away his actions by saying ive throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my familys businesses and thats just the way our family works we support each other and our activities gregg as a member of president barack obamas deficit commission defended cutting social security by quoting willie sutton who when asked why he robbed banks replied because thats where the money is the new york times on august   published a letter by gregg advocating cuts in social security benefits commerce secretary nomination and withdrawaledit on february   politico and cnn reported that gregg accepted president obamas offer to be the next united states secretary of commerce if gregg had been confirmed by the senate he would have had to resign his senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by democratic governor john lynch sources from both parties confirmed that greggs former chief of staff republican bonnie newman would have been chosen to replace him the washington post had alleged that gregg would not accept the appointment unless gov lynch agreed to appoint a republican to fill his seat until  in february  many news outlets noted that gregg had in  voted to abolish the united states department of commerce although he has stated that he supports the stimulus package promoted by president obama he has stated that he will recuse himself from voting on the package with reports that the obama administration would move the united states census bureau typically run by the commerce department out of greggs jurisdiction republican leaders urged obama to allow gregg to run the census or withdraw greggs nomination on february   gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of united states commerce secretary citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill white house press secretary robert gibbs issued a statement regarding greggs withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for obamas economic agenda made during the vetting process senator gregg reached out to the president and offered his name for secretary of commerce he was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies he would support embrace and move forward with the presidents agenda once it became clear after his nomination that senator gregg was not going to be supporting some of president obamas key economic priorities it became necessary for senator gregg and the obama administration to part ways we regret that he has had a change of heart while speaking to press afterward gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the commerce secretary nomination in an interview response to the ap gregg was quoted as saying for  years ive been my own person in charge of my own views and i guess i hadnt really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views and so this is basically where it came out in february  the associated press reported that gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the pease air force base into an industrial park according to senate records gregg has collected from  to  from his investments in pease air force base while helping to arrange at least  million in federal aid

passed language that would significantly adjust the bureau’s structure as part of their bank reform billthe trump administration’s banking reform language although not as aggressive as that of the house proposes revamping the bureaua lawsuit is pending in the circuit court of appeals that could if decided as it was in the lower court fundamentally change the way the director of the cfpb is appointed making him or her subject to removal at the president’s discretionthis suit and others could also potentially lead to the total elimination of the cfpb or to a finding that many of its rules were promulgated in an unconstitutional manneradvertisementthe cfpb is to be kind a controversial placeit is also a very unusual bureauthe cfpb was created when the doddfrank bank bill was passed after the financial crisis of  and doddfrank was passed in the senate on what was essentially a party line vote during a time when the democrats had a filibusterproof majority they had no need to facilitate republican participation in the drafting of the billin fact the markup of the final bill occurred in a conference committee of the house and senate banking committees which started one afternoon and went through the night ending at five in the morning with the final productno republican amendments of any significance were allowed to pass the cfpb was created during the marathon markupat the time some republicans including myself noted that the cfpb as passed would be the most powerful and unanswerable agency in the history of the governmentit would make j edgar hoover’s fbi look like child’s play when it came to a rogue agencyit was as constituted uncontrollable by and unresponsive to elected leaders specifically the president and the congress no matter their partyas structured the cfpb delivered on everything progressives saw as necessary to their purposeit would be able to direct its actions and wrath against any person or organization that its leadership deemed to not help the causes of the left this was particularly important given the left’s instinctive antipathy towards the market economy and specifically bankersthe cfpb was the ultimate force to further the purposes of the occupy wall street movement which so animates the left then and nowthis power of the cfpb was made operable because for the first time in american government the congress created an agency whose leadership was not subject to review by the executive branch and whose funding was not subject to the oversight of the congressthe cfpb director was set up to serve a fiveyear term without any avenue of recall or control from the presidentunlike other such agencies where the leadership can be terminated by the president — or where there is a board of oversight including members of both parties — the cfpb had one leader who was allpowerful and unaccountablein addition the cfpb funding did not come under congressional control instead it was funded from the federal reservethe securities and exchange commission comptroller of the currency and even the supreme court must come to the congress to get their fundingarticle one of the constitution places the power of the purse with the congress for a reason it is to make sure that people who are answerable to the people through elections have the ultimate say in how bureaucracy deals with the people it is called “government by the people”the cfpb thus was brought forth during a midnight birthing as an illegitimate child of the progressive movementthis movement has no problems with trampling on the rights and purpose of our historic ‘checks and balances’ constitutional form of government if it is seen as giving them poweronce created the cfpb under its present director consolidated its already concentrated powerit has limited the people it hires to do enforcement to those who are true believers in its progressive causes it has stonewalled all attempts by congress to gain even the most elementary information about its enforcement actionsit has developed a police statelike approach in its treatment of those it deems targets it has become the rogue bureau just as was predicated at its inceptionthe cfpb was the brainchild of sen elizabeth warrenelizabeth warrenfox  friends hosts criticize dem selfies after repeal vote senate heading for late night ahead of obamacare repeal showdown dem senators seek assurances icahn not swaying regulators on aig report more dmass dating back to the days before she held elected officewarren then a teacher at harvard law school like so many elites believes without question that because they are in the right neither historic precedent nor prior rules should restrain their initiativesthey pursue with singular vigor the use of the government to control the lives of those they see as lesser or malevolent or bothnow of course whenever the structure of the cfpb is questioned those who challenge it are tarred by the left and their media acolytes as undermining the selfproclaimed protections of consumers that the cfpb is suppose to defendthis is truly a unique argumentto paraphrase its proponents assert that they need to destroy the protections of the constitution — and in particular its commitment to having government answerable to the people — in the name of protecting the peoplethe arrogance of this position is only exceeded by the abuse of our constitutional system that the cfpb representswe can only hope that at least once the various avenues of review and reform that are now being pursued overcome the regal intransience of warren and her progressives handypersonsonly then will this bureau be steered back into the orbit of government by the peoplejudd gregg r is a former governor and threeterm senator from new hampshire who served as

gregg fixing the budget by judd gregg    am edt  nbsp  getty images the primary reason that the congressional budget process is not functioning is that it requires difficult decisions this is not something congress is good atnegotiations over the budget are structured to guarantee significant confrontations rooted in partisanship and “turf wars”advertisementthe existing rules that govern the process would lead to an effective budget procedure and end product if the above factors were not in play but they are so the whole thing falls apartthus the country often does not have a federal budget even when it has had some semblance of a budget in place over the last decade or so this has had little practical impact on disciplining federal spending or reforming tax policyto fix this problem and actually have the congress produce budgets that are meaningful and effective there needs to be fundamental change adjustments must address the causes of the breakdown in the present budget process these causes are the hyperpartisan nature of the way the budget is developed the budget is the only major legislation that is intentionally produced along clear partisan lines the majority party has to write and pass a budget with essentially only its members supporting it this guarantees significant systemic opposition to any budget by the minority the fact that other panels see the budget committee’s product — ie the budget itself — as a threat to their jurisdiction and areas of responsibility this is particularly true of both the senate finance committee and the senate appropriations committee thus the budget is often undermined by the desire of other committees to protect their “turf” the actual form that the budget takes does not relate to the core problems that a budget should address it is too appropriationscentric it does not address the size of the debt in a formal way only rarely does it grapple with the twothirds of the spending of the government that involves entitlements or revenues it is not set up to separate out capital spending federal personnel policies or unused funds it has no comprehensive way to address major federal expenditure areas such as healthcare that cut across multiple committees and involve both discretionary and entitlement spending it is simply dysfunctional in its structurein order to address these issues there needs to be a major rethink of the approach to developing a federal budgetfirstly the budget committee itself should be reconstituted it should be made up in large part of the senior members of the committees most affected by the end product this would create a greater likelihood of buyin from those powerful committees and dilute the forces that are naturally at odds with the effortonethird of the budget committee should be from appropriations onethird from finance and onethird from the general membership of the senate the respective party leaders should choose the chairman and ranking member from the general membershipthe budget committee should be a bipartisan committee it should have its membership divided fiftyfifty between the parties with the chairman being from the majority party this would mean that both parties would have to take responsibility for producing a budget — or take the blame for the failure to do sothis would also increase the chances of reaching the kind of consensus necessary to make progress on difficult issues such as healthcare reform and tax reformthe budget goals should be set in terms of the debttogdp ratio if possible the same type of approach should be used to set limits on spending and tax policyno appropriation bills should be allowed to move to the floor in the absence of a budget including an omnibus bill spending on discretionary accounts and on major entitlements should be reduced by five percent from the prior year and revenues from the fica and hi taxes should be increased by five percent if no budget is passed this would put extreme pressure on the bipartisan committee and the congress to produce and pass the budgetthe three largest areas of federal entitlement spending — social security medicare and medicaid — should be broken out as a separate item they could be reviewed to ensure certain goals would be reached pertaining to the debttogdp ratio this would be done via a process that would cross committee lines of jurisdiction instead engaging all the affected committees in a single process of reviewa capital budget process should be added that also coordinates all the committees of jurisdictiona budget organized according to these concepts would dramatically increase the likelihood that the largest government in the world — a government that is spending almost  trillion a year — would actually have a functioning budget it would mean a disciplined approached to spending and tax policy and it would mean that the american people’s confidence in their government and the congress would increase significantlysuch an event would border on revolutionary — and it would also be a nice way to governjudd gregg r is a former governor and threeterm senator from new hampshire who served as chairman
