the mena protein isoforms scientific  clinical publications  presentations patents and intellectual property videos home  technology  the mena protein isoforms the mena protein isoforms the mena protein is a key potentiator and modulator of cellular migration and is a prometastatic factor mena is involved in the nucleation and polymerization of actin being a cellular regulator of assembling and dynamic of cytoplasmic actin networks  it belongs to the enavasp enabledvasp family along with vasp and enavasplike being encoded by mena gene located on chromosome  mena is found in the developing embryo where it is an important actor in the developing nervous system among other functions it facilitates and organizes formation extension and navigation of growing nerve fibers through tissue to link with other neurons forming the proper circuits needed for a functional nervous system its expression decreases from embryonic to adult life studies have revealed that enavasp proteins are involved in those processes where dynamic actin reorganization is necessary such as neural closure phagocytosis hemostasis chemotaxis cell migration cellcell and cellmatrix adhesions fibrillogenesis or fibroblastic motility however in metastatic cancer cells high levels of the mena protein accumulate and influence a number of intracellular inside the cell signaling pathways mena facilitates a dangerous process whereby tumor cells send out a wellorganized protuberance that invades surrounding tissue and pulls the remainder of the cell behind it mena modulates the strength and direction of this invasive process mena steers the migrating cancer cell in the direction of blood vessels through its ability to modulate the metastatic cell’s response to chemical signals that attract it to blood vessels mena is present in cancer cells in more than one form these different varieties called isoforms are similar but slightly different in structure protein isoforms despite their similarity in structure can sometimes have very large differences in their influence on cells we have identified the most dangerous isoform of mena  named menainv mena invasive menaa on the other hand is the mena isoform that seems to exert a much more positive influence on the cell’s behavior reducing the ability of cells to break away from the tumor and invade and migrate toward blood vessels our driverbased mena isoform protein diagnostic biomarkers also serve as novel therapeutic targets for antimetastatic drugs our breakthrough was the discovery of a novel approach through a proprietary mechanism of action to make intracellular mena isoform proteins drugable targets  site info privacy policy disclaimer sitemap contact us careers investor quicklinks ir overview news

platform the menacalc™ test is a next generation driverbased assay that measures the aggressiveness of a patient’s tumor and predicts the likelihood the cancer will spread information provided by the menacalc™ test allows oncologists to personalize treatment strategies and improve outcomes based on the patient’s individual tumor biology the menacalc™ test is intended for use in patients with all molecular subtypes of early stage stage  invasive breast cancer including triple negative tnc and herpositive her breast cancer as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a number of other epithelialbased tumors the menacalc™ test  is a fully automated quantitative immunofluorescence assay performed on formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe tissue from a biopsy using proprietary digital pathology and image analysis methods the assay quantifies expression levels of the mena protein and the menaa isoform the mena protein and its isoforms are key potentiators and modulators of cellular phenotype migration invasion and metastasis overexpression of menainv and downregulation of menaa in tumor cells correlate with metastatic potential clinical studies have demonstrated the menacalc™ score is associated with increased risk of systemic metastasis and decreased overall survival in january  the menacalc™ assay was analytically validated under clia in our stateoftheart cliacertified commercial laboratory located in boston ma highrisk patients patients with aggressive tumors that are more likely to spread are stratified as highrisk  highrisk patients are often treated with adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent disease recurrence and the development of systemic metastasis data from the menacalc™ breast assay as shown in figure  is representative of a high menacalc™ score which is associated with higher risk for the development of metastasis figure  overexpression of pan mena yellow is shown  in this tumor section from a patient with early stage invasive breast cancer lowrisk patients patients with less aggressive indolent tumors that are less likely to spread are stratified as lowrisk lowrisk patients can be spared from the harmful side effects and expense of chemotherapy as the risks of adverse events and the development of future malignancies associated with adjuvant chemotherapy outweigh any marginal benefits data from the menacalc™ breast assay as shown in figure  is representative of a low menacalc™ score which is associated with lower risk for the development of metastasis figure  overexpression of the menaa isoform red is shownin this tumor section from a patient with early stage invasive breast cancer clinical summary results from a study of  patients with axilliary nodenegative invasive breast cancer confirming earlier results that menacalc™ breast was a strong predictor of diseasespecific survival patients who had high menacalc™ scores had a fold greater risk of death compared to patients with low menacalc™ scores when controlled for other traditional clinical factors results from this study was published in bmc cancer by forse et al in june  in april  positive results were presented from a clinical study of  patients demonstrating menacalc™ lung as an independent prognostic factor and predictor of metastasis in patients with early stage nsclc at the american association for cancer research aacr annual meeting results from this study demonstrated that menacalc™ lung scores were significantly higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma as compared to other subtypes high menacalc™ lung scores were associated with decrease year disease specific survival in all patients and were significantly associated with survival in the squamousonly population key advantages next generation diagnostic based on the biological mechanisms that drive metastasis high analytical accuracy reproducibility and precision for use in patients with all subtypes of early stage stage  invasive breast cancer including estrogen receptorpositive erhernegative disease triple negative and her disease mena expression is linked to several cancers including prostate squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and colorectal
