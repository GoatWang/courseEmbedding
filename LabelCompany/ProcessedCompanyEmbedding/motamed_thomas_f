and vision to cna  return to table of contents taking the helm in a perfect storm industry veteran tom motamed brings experience and vision to cna by elisabeth boone cpcu the phrase “perfect storm” taken from the title of sebastian junger’s breathtaking saga of the gloucester fishing fleet’s encounter with destiny in the north atlantic has been used to describe everything from meteorological catastrophes to financial collapses albeit well worn the term describes with pinpoint accuracy the situation in which large multiple line insurers currently find themselves like the foot waves that buffeted the swordboat “andrea gail” in the perfect storm powerful forces are challenging carriers on all sides the prolonged soft market in propertycasualty lines possible reserve inadequacies for life companies the stock market volatility the credit crunch and the ongoing crisis in the housing market given the number nature and magnitude of these challenges few would question the decision of industry veteran thomas f motamed to retire last june from the chubb corporation after a distinguished year career with the insurer motamed joined chubb in  as a claims trainee and in  was elected vice chairman and chief operating officer quite a few people however might wonder what motivated motamed to defer his wellearned rr and instead return to the executive suite this time at a leading multiline carrier based in chicago on january   motamed began his tenure as chairman and chief executive officer of cna financial the holding company of cna insurance companies he succeeded stephen w lilienthal who retired in deccember  after holding those positions since  in an exclusive interview with rough notes motamed explained his reasons for accepting the top post at cna and from the perspective of his first  days on the job shared his insights into the myriad challenges that face his organization and its competitors in today’s stormtossed market “first and foremost i thought there was a tremendous opportunity to build a great company” motamed said “cna has been around since  so it has a long history and i thought it had good people this is a people business and if you have good people who are on the right page you can win” ranking priorities given the “perfect storm” in which insurers are struggling to remain afloat how do leaders like motamed approach the challenge of establishing their priorities “everyone—individuals businesses in general and certainly insurance companies—is facing a decline in the value of their assets” motamed observed “to me probably the most serious issue insurance companies are dealing with particularly life companies is the asset side of the balance sheet clearly everyone is hoping for an economic recovery and a financial market recovery but we need to be constantly looking at ways to improve the financial side of the business” in recent months some life insurers have been petitioning their home state insurance departments to reduce reserve requirements to help preserve their financial stability ratings in the current crisis we asked motamed to comment on this trend “every insurance company i know has taken a hit on the asset side” he replied “when that happens you’re subjected to scrutiny by the rating agencies i believe that all of us who run companies who believe that we have good products services and people don’t want to operate under the cloud of a lower rating people look to the financial strength of insurers to protect their assets when it comes to a claim” he pointed out “it’s important to remember that we’re not the only ones in control of our destiny we’re watched by the rating agencies and by state regulators and by the federal government when it gives tarp money to insurers” in this environment motamed remarked “i think everyone is trying to avoid a downturn in their rating” eye on the cycle these days you’d have to go a long way to find any pollyannas in the insurance business and motamed is no relentless optimist neither however is he a pessimist his long experience in the industry informs his stance as a confirmed realist “i think it’s a great business with great people and it’s cyclical” he said “people have to understand that we’re in a cycle now where it’s not as lucrative for insurers and customers are getting lower prices and that will change” for that reason motamed sees no reason to view today’s soft propertycasualty market as anything more than an inevitable turn in the traditional underwriting cycle “a lot of people are complaining about the soft market but the current soft cycle is a lot shorter than historic soft market cycles” he commented “it’s not as bad as people think and the calendar year results are pretty good for most insurance companies the current accident years are coming under some pressure but a lot of companies reported pretty good earnings and combined ratios aside from what happened on the investment side of the house “core property and casualty results continue to be pretty good” motamed continued “growth is not good but in economic times like these where sales and payrolls are down and people are not reinvesting in their businesses it’s hard to charge people more money for insurance when they’re already suffering economically” in times like these motamed said “whether you’re an insurance company or an agent the most important thing you can do is stay close to the customer we have to stay close to our agents and brokers and we have to execute our fundamentals in a superb way we also have to be clear about our abilities in the marketplace and we have to exercise what i call ‘continuing underwriting discipline’” motamed asserted it’s equally important to recognize he continued that “this is a facetoface business underwriters need to be in front of their agents and agents need to be in front of their customers technology is never going to change the facetoface nature of the business and i don’t think it should” pointing to another imperative motamed said “we have to make sure we’re providing excellent service to the ultimate customer because that’s who pays the bills” playing to strengths how does motamed characterize the key strengths of cna in today’s economic climate “i’ve learned a lot about the company since i got here and i’ve been very pleased” motamed replied “first we have good ratings and people look to that we have solid service capabilities in claims risk control and backoffice operations we’re known in the marketplace for underwriting strength in our healthpro business construction and our programs” the cna healthpro division was profiled in an article titled “leading the way in health care liability” in the october  issue of rough notes a key strength for cna is its relationships with the agents and brokers who distribute its products motamed emphasized “we’re very much an independent agent company and agents will be hearing more about cna expanding its relationships with groups like the big ‘i’ and the ciab we believe we have to work with our agency force to provide firstclass solutions to clients” he said “agents need to be more selective as to whom they represent” motamed remarked “and stick with those relationships and build stronger relationships with a core group of companies rather than dealing with a fractured list of markets it’s not economical and it creates problems on the eo side if you don’t really know what your markets are selling” what’s more motamed commented “agents have to be more vocal to their underwriters as to what products and services they want and what their customers are willing to pay for on the other hand we as underwriters know that price is part of every sales equation but agents need to demonstrate their value to the client as well as the value of the market they are representing “at the end of the day” motamed asserted “relationships are everything in soft markets and hard markets agents want longterm relationships with their clients and we want the same with our agents it’s cost effective ultimately it’s more profitable not only for the agent and the underwriter but also for the client when there’s a longterm relationship” future of consolidation the last several years have seen the consolidation of some industry giants that few if any industry observers ever would have imagined joining forces centuriesold names have disappeared amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions as insurers seek to control their everrising costs of doing business we asked motamed to comment on this trend and whether he expects it to continue “it’s kind of a ‘tale of two cities’” he responded “on the one hand i expect more consolidation because there are companies with weaker balance sheets that are unable to raise capital in this economic climate underwriting results have deteriorated in the soft market so logically that suggests that some companies would view a sale to be in the best interests of their shareholders “on the other hand there are fewer buyers because they have weaker balance sheets as well” motamed observed “and they also have the problem of raising capital today what’s more today there are many fewer companies to buy than there were  years ago so when you look at consolidation logically it should happen—but will it only time will tell” like his peers in the executive suites of other top insurers motamed was leery of playing the role of crystal ball gazer asked what he thinks the propertycasualty business might look like three to five years from now he did offer some thoughts “i can’t predict the future with any degree of accuracy but i expect there will be a turning point on pricing in the next year or two” motamed said “however that will be muted by the effects of the economy underwriters will be able to get a better price for the product but whether it’s payroll sales or total insured values they are still going to be depressed until the economy comes back “we’re looking at a scenario where the bottom line may improve but growth will be difficult in a soft economy profitability could improve as rates increase but the fact is that clients still won’t be paying a lot more for their insurance” motamed said challenges notwithstanding motamed declared “i continue to be excited about the opportunities at cna it’s great to be back in the saddle and cna has a lot of advantages we have talented people who really want to work with our agents and our local presence in the marketplace with cna offices is very important so our field people can have facetoface discussions with their agents” motamed said “we want to be a company that thinks in a big way but acts very locally”         “this is a facetoface business underwriters need to be in front of their agents and agents need to be in front of their customers” —thomas f motamed chairman and chief executive officer cna financial

company abel uribe chicago tribunethomas motamed fresh out of law school found the legal profession too dryso at a friends suggestion he tried another field he thought might be more interesting peddling life insurancebut that got old fasti really didnt like sitting around kitchen tables at night telling people when you die your spouse is going to be living in a refrigerator box by the railroad tracks if you dont buy insurance motamed said it didnt come out exactly that way but that was the messageafter a year of selling life insurance he joined chubb corp — which sold property and casualty insurance — and went on to work at the new jerseybased company for  years eventually landing the no  job as vice chairman and chief operating officerthen in  conglomerate loews corp controlled by new yorks billionaire tisch family came calling it needed a new ceo to run its chicagobased cna financial subsidiary which sells property and casualty insurance to businessesmotamed took the job and moved into the red tower at  s wabash ave in january  he planned to stay until  but thanks to a renegotiated contract will stay through  his total compensation each of the past two years has been more than  millionunder motameds leadership revenues are up as the company has made a bigger effort to serve such industries as technology and financial services and the companys credit rating has been upgraded it has resumed its cash dividend and also has made an underwriting profit in four of the past five years the exception being the year that superstorm sandy hit the northeastit was a great choice by loews to pick him to run cna said pat ryan former ceo of aon who now heads ryan specialty groupcna profits also have been helped by cost cutting more than  chicagoarea jobs have been shed since motamed  took the helm that represented about a quarter of its local workforce many of them information technology jobs that were outsourcedhis early years the son of an iranian immigrant father and an irish mother his parents married young and divorced when motamed was only his father who got full custody was in college all day and would come home at night motamed recalled then his father went to medical school worked as an intern and a resident and went on to become a surgeonmy grandmother wanted me more than he wanted me motamed said he described his grandmother as very supportive and said he was essentially raised by his fathers parents in garden city ny on long islandmotamed earned a biology degree at adelphi university in garden city he was the captain and most valuable player on the lacrosse team the athletic field is named for himi had a full college career and didnt spend a lot of time in the library motamed saidthat may have derailed his familys expectation of him getting into medical school and to follow in the footsteps of his father grandfather who was a surgeon to the shah of iran in the s and great grandfather an aunt was a radiologisthis career path motamed held  jobs in his first  years at chubb many lateral moves and in departments such as claims legal training field operations and marketingthats how you really learn things he said most people today cant do what he did he said because the rise in dualincome couples makes it more difficult to movehow he became ceo of cna financial loews ceo jim tisch whose company owns about  percent of cna stock said motamed had been on his radar since conducting the search that led to the hiring of the guy motamed would replacewe were ready to go out and hire a headhunter when one director sitting next to tom at an industry event asked tom if he might be interested in the cna job tisch recalled motamed said he met with tisch on and off for five monthsi thought it was an opportunity to take a brand name that was tarnished and turn it around or polish it motamed said motamed told business insurance magazine in  that as he looked at cna he didnt think it had a real growth strategy and there certainly was room for improvement on the profitability sidehis hiring was announced in may  but because of a oneyear noncompete and longterm incentives hed forfeit if he violated it motamed wasnt supposed to join cna until june by the fall of  tisch decided he didnt want to wait until then chubb released motamed from certain noncompete restrictions that allowed him to join cna on jan  what tisch liked about motamed he knows the industry and business inside and out including claims underwriting marketing and legal adding that he also knows almost everyone in the commercial property and casualty insurance businesstisch tells of how one relatively large insurance brokerage had a grudge against cna so tisch arranged for the head of that brokerage and motamed to

represented by stephen allen loney jr  hogan lovells us llp not for publication opinion anne e thompson district judge this matter comes before the court upon the motions to dismiss brought by defendants the ayco company lp ayco and the chubb corporation chubb on the basis of federal rule of civil procedure b ecf nos   plaintiffs thomas f motamed george r fay and david s fowler plaintiffs oppose ecf nos   the court has issued the opinion below based upon the written submissions of the parties and without oral argument pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for the reasons stated herein chubbs motion to dismiss will be denied and aycos motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part background plaintiffs are former chubb executives plaintiffs allegations are as follows as employees of chubb plaintiffs participated in a company retirement program which entitled them to certain deferred compensation benefits after retirement in  chubb offered plaintiffs the opportunity to participate in a new benefit program called the chubb corporation estate enhancement program this program was designed to reduce plaintiffs estate tax payments by providing part of their compensation in the form of a life insurance policy which would not be taxed ayco advised chubb on the creation of the program helped market the program and also acted as an individual financial adviser to plaintiff george fay fay to participate in the program plaintiffs would relinquish their rights to accrued benefits in the company pension plan in return chubb would purchase a variable life insurance policy for each plaintiff under a splitdollar arrangement chubb would make a onetime premium payment to the insurance company in the amount of approximately four times the relinquished pension benefits the policy provided a death benefit payable after the death of each plaintiff and his spouse under the splitdollar arrangement each plaintiffs estate would receive  of the face value of the policy and chubb would receive  of the face value of the policy and the policy cash value in marketing the program to plaintiffs chubb stated that the financial benefits from participating in the program were potentially much greater than the plaintiffs would receive through the deferred pension plan all three plaintiffs chose to participate in the program and relinquished between  and  in pension benefits in exchange for life insurance policies with face values between  and  chubb paid the initial premiums to purchase the policies however the face value of each policy was actually an estimate based on an estimated return on the investments in the policies of at least  per year compounded for the life of the policies the investments have not resulted in a return of at least  therefore on may   plaintiffs received a letter advising them that the life insurance policies would lapse unless they made significant additional premium payments meanwhile plaintiffs have been required to pay taxes each year on the economic value of the death benefit this value increased over time and will increase dramatically after the death of the first insured of each couple making the tax payments unsustainable on october   plaintiffs filed suit against chubb and ayco arguing that the benefit program was inadequately designed and marketed and should not have been offered to chubbs executives plaintiffs asserted claims against chubb under theories of breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and detrimental reliance plaintiffs asserted claims against ayco under the theory of negligent misrepresentation and fay individually asserts claims for breach of contract and professional malpractice chubb and ayco filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs complaint on december   in lieu of opposing the motions to dismiss plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on january   on january   chubb and ayco filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint the court granted aycos motion to dismiss on march   dismissing the counts against ayco without prejudice on march   the court granted chubbs motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part the motion was denied as to the breach of contract claims and granted as to the breach of fiduciary duty and detrimental reliance claims then on april   plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on may   ayco and chubb filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint these motions are presently before the court discussion a legal standard a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b tests the sufficiency of a complaint kost v kozakiewicz  fd   d cir  the defendant bears the burden of showing that no claim has been presented hedges v united states  fd   d cir  when considering a rule b motion a district court should conduct a threepart analysis see malleus v george  fd   d cir  first the court must take note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim id quoting ashcroft v iqbal  us    second the court must accept as true all of a plaintiffs wellpleaded factual allegations and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff fowler v upmc shadyside  fd   d cir  the court may disregard any conclusory legal allegations id finally the court must determine whether the facts are sufficient to show that plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief id at  quoting iqbal  us at  such a claim requires more than a mere allegation of an entitlement to relief or demonstration of the mere possibility of misconduct instead the facts must allow a court to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged id at   quoting iqbal  us at  b analysis  chubbs motion to dismiss the second amended complaint contains claims against chubb for breach of contract and detrimental reliance the court will address each claim in turn a breach of contract in its most recent motion to dismiss chubb asserts that the second amended complaint fails to state claims for breach of contract because plaintiffs factual allegations of breach are inconsistent with the terms of the agreements plaintiffs respond that this argument is barred by the law of the case doctrine as it was previously considered when the court decided chubbs prior motion to dismiss in the alternative plaintiffs assert that this argument is barred by federal rule of civil procedure g the law of the case doctrine limits relitigation of an issue once it has been decided in an earlier stage of the same litigation hamilton v leavy  fd   d cir  citing in re continental airlines inc  fd   d cir  the doctrine is designed to promote finality consistency and judicial economy id at  the law of the case doctrine does not limit a federal courts power but it directs its exercise of discretion public interest research group of nj inc v magnesium elektron inc  fd   d cir  courts generally do not revisit prior decisions in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as when  new evidence is available  a supervening new law has been announced or  the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice id at  however this doctrine only applies when decisions are made on the merits of a case see eg united states v hatter  us    the court previously considered chubbs argument that the breach of contract claims against chubb should be dismissed because plaintiffs allegations were inconsistent with the plain language of the agreement see op  ecf no  the court determined that this defense goes to the merits of the case and should be raised in responsive pleadings not in a preanswer motion brought under rule b id citing worldcom inc v graphnet inc  fd   d cir  moreover the court noted that the terms of the life insurance policies were themselves at issue and that the terms were not plain and unambiguous op  ecf no  the court agrees that this decision was not made on the merits of the breach of contract claims and thus the law of the case doctrine does not apply however the court finds that its prior reasoning still holds and the issue is still premature for consideration at this stage of the litigation moreover chubbs inclusion of this argument in its second motion to dismiss appears to be an attempt to ask the court to reconsider its prior opinion without having filed a motion for reconsideration given that no motion for reconsideration was filed within the fourteen days allowed under local rule i the court will not reconsider the issue at this time therefore chubbs motion to dismiss will not be granted as to these claims b detrimental reliance chubb further argues that the complaint fails to state a detrimental reliance claim because the additions made to this claim in the second amended complaint supply very little meat to the bare bones allegations of detrimental reliance the court found to be insufficient in the first amended complaint defs br  ecf no  plaintiffs respond that the detrimental reliance claim should not be dismissed because plaintiffs plead all of the required elements of the claim to establish a claim for detrimental reliance a plaintiff must establish  that the defendant made a representation  that the defendant had knowledge that the plaintiff was acting on the basis of that representation and  that the plaintiff relied to their detriment on that representation granelli v chicago title ins co  f appx   d cir  citation omitted see also facteon inc v comp care partners llc no   wl  at  dnj feb   noting that the elements of a detrimental reliance claim are a clear and definite promise an expectation by the promisor that the promise would be relied on and reasonable reliance by the promisee in response to chubbs prior motion to dismiss the court found that plaintiffs pled elements one and two of detrimental reliance but that they failed to address element three reliance in the second amended complaint plaintiffs allege that chubb promised that the estate enhancement program would result in increased benefits to the estates of the participants that the programs would result in death benefits as set forth in the respective insurance policies that plaintiffs would not be responsible for additional premiums and that the program was economically viable second am compl ¶  ecf no  plaintiffs further allege that they relied on chubbs representations because they agreed to participate in the program based on chubbs promises id ¶  while chubb characterizes these allegations as bare bones defs br  ecf no  more is not required at this juncture chubb also argues that plaintiffs reliance is unreasonable as a matter of law based on various statements chubb made in the contract and in other materials provided to plaintiffs however as noted above this is not a case where the terms of the contract are plain and unambiguous therefore a decision on this issue is premature at the stage of a motion to dismiss and so chubbs motion will be not be granted on this basis for the foregoing reasons chubbs motion to dismiss will be denied in its entirety  aycos motion to dismiss the second amended complaint contains claims against ayco for negligent misrepresentation breach of contract and professional malpractice in its most recent motion to dismiss ayco makes multiple arguments first ayco asserts that the complaint fails to state a negligent misrepresentation claim because plaintiffs fail to plead reliance or a misrepresentation second ayco argues that all of plaintiffs claims are timebarred by the statute of limitations third ayco disputes fays malpractice claim on the grounds that fay pleads neither causation nor injury fourth ayco asserts that fay fails to state a claim for breach of contract because he does not allege that there is a contract under which he can sue lastly ayco argues that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of fays malpractice claim a statute of limitations and negligent misrepresentation plaintiffs assert that aycos arguments as to the statute of limitations and their failure to plead a misrepresentation are barred by the law of the case doctrine the court previously considered aycos argument that the complaint should be dismissed because the claims were timebarred and as well as the argument that plaintiffs failed to plead misrepresentation a required element of negligent misrepresentation see op   ecf no  in response to the allegations on failure to plead misrepresentation the court ruled that while plaintiffs could have provided more detail these allegations provide enough material to survive a motion to dismiss id at  as for the statute of limitations argument the court ruled that accepting all of plaintiffs allegations as true—as the court must when reviewing a motion to dismiss—the claims fell within the statute of limitations id at  given that the court previously decided these issues and these rulings were on the merits aycos arguments as to the statute of limitations and failure to plead a misrepresentation would be barred by the law of the case doctrine unless one of the exceptions to this doctrine applied as described above the three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine are when  new evidence is available  a supervening new law has been announced or  the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice public interest research group of nj inc  fd at  ayco has not argued that any of these exceptions apply instead it argues that the courts prior decisions on this issue were dicta and thus are not barred by the law of the case doctrine however the court finds that these decisions were integral to the courts prior opinion and thus were not dicta because the court already considered these arguments and ayco has not shown that any exception applies the court finds that the arguments regarding the statute of limitations and the failure to plead a misrepresentation are barred by the law of the case doctrine therefore aycos motion to dismiss will not be granted on these bases as for aycos argument that plaintiffs fail to plead justifiable reliance another required element of negligent misrepresentation the court finds that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient under new jersey law the elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim are  the defendant negligently made a false communication of material fact  the plaintiff justifiably relied upon the misrepresentation and  the reliance resulted in an ascertainable loss or injury elias v ungars food products inc  frd   dnj  the court previously found that plaintiffs failed to plead any factual allegations of justifiable reliance because they only said that plaintiffs motamed fay and fowler justifiably relied on the information supplied to them and the representation that the estate enhancement program would be an effective program when they opted to participate in the program and relinquish their rights to receive benefits under the chubb pension excess benefit plan op at  ecf no  citing am compl ¶  ecf no  this allegation was conclusory and did not provide any factual support for plaintiffs claim of justifiable reliance in the second amended complaint plaintiffs add that they justifiably relied on aycos misrepresentations because ayco is a national organization that held itself out as having expertise in designing and evaluating retirement benefits and programs and was handselected by chubb to be the consultant tasked with providing competent financial advice for its executives second am compl ¶¶    ecf no  further but for aycos misrepresentations plaintiffs would not have agreed to relinquish their deferred compensation and participate in the program id ¶¶    with the addition of these factual allegations the court finds that plaintiffs adequately pled justifiable reliance therefore aycos motion to dismiss the negligent misrepresentation claim will not be granted b professional malpractice ayco argues that fay fails to state a claim for professional malpractice because the second amended complaint fails to plead causation or injury a professional malpractice claim accrues when  the claimant suffers an injury or damages and  the claimant knows or should know that its injury is attributable to the professional negligent advice vision mortgage corp v patricia j chiapperini inc  ad   nj super ct app div  affd  ad  nj  citation omitted the court previously dismissed fays professional malpractice claim on the grounds that by failing to state that he participated in the program on the basis of aycos advice fay has not pled that the injury is attributable to or caused by the allegedly professionally negligent advice op at  ecf no  in the second amended complaint fay adds that but for aycos advice fay would not have agreed to participate in the program second am compl ¶  ecf no  this addition is sufficient for plaintiffs claim to survive a motion to dismiss as for aycos argument that fay did not plead any injury the court notes that fay pleads that he will suffer the lapse of the insurance policy and unsustainable income tax payments as a result of aycos alleged professional malpractice id ¶  these injuries are sufficient to support a professional malpractice claim consequently aycos motion to dismiss the professional malpractice claim will not be granted c breach of contract ayco argues that fay fails to state a claim for breach of contract because he does not adequately plead that he was a thirdparty beneficiary of the chubbayco agreement as he does not cite specific contract provisions permitting him to raise a direct claim against ayco moreover ayco argues that because fay does not allege a specific contractual duty separate from professional malpractice the breach of contract claim is subsumed by his malpractice claim the court agrees that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of fays professional malpractice claim although fay pleads that the aycochubb contract exists he does not plead that any particular provisions of this contract have been breached rather fay argues that under the contract ayco had a contractual obligation to provide appropriate and competent advice to fay that was breached when ayco recommended that he participate in the estate enhancement program and failed to disclose certain risks second am compl ¶¶  ecf no  specifically fay states that the advice provided by ayco was below the standard required of a consultant in the insurance industry and constituted a breach of the contract between ayco and chubb id ¶  in the absence of any additional allegations of breach that go beyond the alleged violations of aycos professional duty the court finds that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of fays professional malpractice claim see amboy bancorporation v bank advisory grp inc  f appx   d cir  lopezsiguenza v roddy no   wl  at  dnj sept   therefore the breach of contract claim count viii will be dismissed with prejudice consequently aycos motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part the motion will be granted as to count viii and denied as to all other counts counts v vi vii and ix conclusion for the reasons stated above chubbs motion to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint will be denied aycos motion to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint will be granted in part and denied in part the motion will be denied as to counts v vi vii and ix the motion will be granted as to count viii and that claim will be dismissed with prejudice a corresponding order follows footnotes  the detrimental reliance claim was dismissed without prejudice whereas the breach of fiduciary duty claim was dismissed with prejudice  plaintiffs also argue that chubbs argument about the breach of contract claims is barred by federal rule of civil procedure g which prohibits raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion the court finds that this rule does not apply because the argument asserted was not
