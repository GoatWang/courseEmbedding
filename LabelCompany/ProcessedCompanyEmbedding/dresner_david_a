july   david dresners restaurant in tower grove south will have one focus potstickers posted by sabrina medler on tue jul   at  am click to enlarge photo courtesy of lindsay keaton david dresner  is the ceo and founder of the new potsticker restaurant in tower grove david dresner was making some potstickers at his parents house when his father gave him the inspiration for his next big idea “why make ordinary potstickers” dresner’s dad asked “when you can make extraordinary potstickers” dresner began brainstorming wacky potsticker recipes with his father and his facebook friends thus prepared he set out on his mission to reinvent the classic dish originally dresner just sought out to create a usdagrade factory for manufacturing crispy edge a wholesale potsticker line but after buying a revamped community center at  juanita street in tower grove south dresner decided to keep the factory intact while turning part of the facility into a new restaurant between dresner’s multiple declarations of love for the potsticker and his assurance that he’s “shining like a care bear shooting rainbow out of its belly” you could say he’s pretty passionate about his product part of what he set out to do is right some of the frequent wrongs done to the appetizer “to me the potsticker has not been given justice” dresner says “what’s the most important part what do people mess up the most the crispy edge it’s too soggy and some people deepfry when it’s supposed to be panseared that’s a disgrace to everything i believe in” click to enlarge photo courtesy of lindsay keaton the chicken chilaquiles potsticker features cumin dough cotija cheese and roasted black bean crispy edge sauced with guacamole and lime dresner has worked to provide a plethora of quality potsticker recipes on the menu a mediterranean potsticker with a dill dough roasted chickpeas a roasted edge tzatziki sauce and fresh mint a parsley dough fresh frittata potsticker with roasted vegetables fried butter and a potato edge and a peanut butter and jelly potsticker with a ruffles potato chip edge “my potstickers are funky every flavor and ethnic influence i’ve ever come across i’m not afraid to wrap in a potsticker” dresner says “we offer potstickers with very unique approaches and very simple approaches as long as someone is willing to explore a fusion i do think it lends itself to a very broad audience a chicago native and graduate of washington university dresner is also the ceo of sleeve a message a sustainable coffee sleeve company though hes only  dresser says that experience has helped him in his new role as a restaurantopener virgin” “sleeve a message taught me a great deal about manufacturing and what i like is that it taught me my potstickers are just another product” dresner says “the standard operating procedures of course are different but what’s very familiar is my passion for the product” the new restaurant which is as yet unnamed is expected to seat  with indoor and outdoor seating a private dining room a large bar and cafe seating the restaurant’s aesthetic is very important to the owner designed to make the potstickers “pop” dresner is utilizing warm lighting in a dark space click to enlarge a dessert potsticker the asian cherry bomb uses green tea matcha dough with a mascarpone pistachio filling and is finished with a lemon white tea sauce though dresner is still figuring out some details he is considering opening the restaurant as a breakfast spot with an extensive coffee program still dresner mentioned recipes for breakfast lunch dinner and dessert potstickers “to be honest im new at the restaurant scene but i’m prepared to find a model that works this restaurant has a really flexible layout and i’ll be listening” dresner says “to bring delicious gourmet potstickers to all the people throughout the land – that’s the mission” dresner hopes to have the place open by october jump to comments « clementines is now serving both
