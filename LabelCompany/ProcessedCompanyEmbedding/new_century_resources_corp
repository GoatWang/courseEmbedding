published apr    pm et share edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements the purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of the consolidated financial results and condition of new century resources corporation and to also describe the plans for future growth and expansion forwardlooking statements this managements discussion and analysis and other parts of this report contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as well as current expectations and assumptions from time to time we may publish forwardlooking statements including those that are contained in this report relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance business prospects acquisition strategies technological developments new products research and development activities and similar matters the private securities litigation reform act of  provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations performance development and results of our business include but are not limited to our ability to maintain sufficient working capital adverse changes in the economy the ability to attract and maintain key personnel our ability to implement our business plan our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements including those set forth elsewhere in this report we assume no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements plan of operation although we were organized to engage in oil and gas exploration we currently are a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury if any or with additional money contributed by our stockholders or another source during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of exchange act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors we have not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex in light of our competitive disadvantages our strategy for successfully identifying and completing business combinations when we are competing with entities that possess great financial technical and managerial capabilities is as follows potential target companies a business entity if any which may be interested in a business combination with the company may include the following � a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses � a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the united states securities market � a special situation company such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified employee stock option plan it is possible that a potential business opportunity may not be beneficial or desirable for our shareholders a potential target may not be able to find an underwriter because the business opportunity is too risky the target does not have significant operations the target has limited history of operations or many other reasons as a part of due diligence investigation of any potential target the company will assess the desirability of any identified target with regard to the risks it may present a business combination with a target company will normally involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors no assurances can be given that the company will be able to enter into a business combination as to the terms of a business combination or as to the nature of the target company the company is seeking to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues the company has no particular acquisitions in mind and has not entered into any negotiations regarding such acquisition the companys officers and directors have not engaged in any substantive contact or discussions with any representative of any other company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger between the company and such other company as of the date of this registration statement the company does not anticipate engaging any professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions but will rely upon the companys business contacts and relationships in seeking a suitable acquisition as part of our investigation of business opportunities the companys management may meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity the company may visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided check references of management and key personnel and conduct other reasonable measures we will generally ask to be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity these materials may include the following � descriptions of product service and company history management resumes � available projections with related assumptions upon which they are based � evidence of existing patents trademarks or service marks or rights thereto � a description of transactions between the prospective entity and its affiliates � a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements we believe an acquisition or merger with the company may be an appealing avenue for a private company seeking to enter the public company sector because the company intends to apply for a trading symbol and quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board andor otc markets any private company can file their own registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in order to become a public company once a registration statement is declared effective the registrant must then provide certain information through a market maker for application for a trading symbol both the registration statement process and application for a trading symbol can be lengthy and expensive often a private company will opt to merge with or be acquired by a company that is already public and has a trading symbol in order to reduce the time and expense required to go public on their own any private company that enters a merger or acquisition transaction with the company must provide all the information required by the securities and exchange commission in a form  registration statement including audited financial statements which will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in a form k current report within four days of closing the transaction the private company will incur significant expense in providing the required information if the company enters into a transaction with a private company it will likely first liquidate the assets and pay off the liabilities so the private company will not receive any benefit of assets currently held by the company the company will not seek shareholder approval for any merger acquisition or similar reorganization shareholder approval for this type of business opportunity is not required under nevada law nor is it required by the companys articles of incorporation shareholder approval will be required if the transaction requires a name change change in capital structure of the company stock splits or any other action that requires shareholder approval under nevada law or our articles of incorporation in the event shareholder approval is required for actions other than a business opportunity the company will prepare file with the sec and mail to shareholders the appropriate information statement or proxy statement if required we believe the sum required to consummate our acquisition or reverse merger is not determinable until the company knows the terms of the transaction the amount of cash the company had on hand as of december   is  such acquisition or reverse merger may be costly we currently have very limited resources with which to complete the acquisition or reverse merger and no cash if we are able raise any capital all of our cash may be exhausted

operations   new century resources corporation   new century resources corporation the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of utah in july of  as wem petroleum inc from inception through  the company conducted operations in the oil and gas industry pursuant to an option granted the company in august of  the company exercised its right to drill exploratory wells on  acres in cache county utah although various wells were drilled and completed the company did not realize any revenues from these oil and gas operations in  the company attempted to refocus its business efforts into the mining industry by entering into an option to lease property and mining equipment in montana it ceased any significant business operations in the latter part of the s when it failed to exercise the option due to lack of funding in  the company made an effort to commence conducting business again by expanding its business purpose to include the marketing and development of hightech products the companys board was also authorized to seek out suitable candidates for acquisition or merger in addition the company authorized a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares one  share for ten  shares although the same was never affected the company ceased doing business until late    in october  the corporation changed its name to new century resources corporation acquiring  of the outstanding stock of gc gulf western trading limited gc in exchange for  shares of stock which gave the stockholders of gc control of the corporation by which it has conducted its operations this acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of gc  no goodwill or other writeup to fair market value of the assets of gc occurred at the time of the merger in  the company was redomiciled in the state of nevada the nevada entity became the surviving corporation and the utah corporation was dissolved on february   as a result of the mergerchange of domicile the articles of incorporation of the nevada entity became the articles of the company   the company divested itself of its  owned subsidiary gc on december   thereby eliminating the trekkopje mining claims a capitalized cost of  the related liabilities amounting to  from its acquisition the note payable to its principal stockholder which aggregated came to a total of  and any claims to accrued interest this divestiture was the unanimous decision of the board of directors which was based in part upon the corporations inability to raise the necessary capital to fund the exploration and development of the trekkopje uranium reserves in addition a feasibility study conducted by dr brian hambleton played crucial role in their decision making process concluding that due to the current uranium market exploitation of the uranium reserves on the property would not be financially viable and did not foresee any immediate or midterm prospects in world market conditions and pricing which would lead to a pricing level justifiable of the exploitation of the uranium reserves   the company has no commitments understandings or agreements with regard to any proposed business operations or opportunities it is the intention of management to actively solicit interested third parties who may be interested in acquiring a controlling interest in what is essentially a shell corporation such transactions are commonly referred to as reverse mergers whereby the company would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of a private entity in exchange for a controlling interest in the public company no assurance can be given that management of the company will be successful in attracting a suitable candidate for this type of transaction or some other type of business combination or what time frame might be involved in consummating any such transaction   note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap   reclassification   certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation  specifically those presentations under reporting requirements as a development stage company these reclassifications had no effect on reported losses        table of contents   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period   the companys significant estimates and assumptions include the fair value of financial instruments inventory valuation and obsolescence revenue recognized or recognizable sales returns and allowances income tax rate income tax provision and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and the assumption that the company will be a going concern  those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such reviews and if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification paragraph  to measure the fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels  the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs  the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below         level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs  if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   the carrying amounts of a companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments        table of contents   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   fiscal yearend   the company elected december  as its fiscal yearend date   cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents   related parties   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions   pursuant to section  the related parties include a affiliates of the company b entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required absent the election of the fair value option under the fair value option subsection of section –– to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity c trusts for the benefit of employees such as pension and profitsharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management d  principal owners of the company e management of the company f other parties with which the company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests and g other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests   the financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions other than compensation arrangements expense allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of business however disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of or combined financial statements is not required in those statements the disclosures shall include  a the nature of the relationships involved  b a description of the transactions including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements c the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period and d amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and if not otherwise apparent the terms and manner of settlement   commitment and contingencies   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification to report accounting for contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the  financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur  the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment  in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the companys financial statements  if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed        table of contents   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed  management does not believe based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows however there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the companys business financial position and results of operations or cash flows   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the company has not generated revenues in the years presented   net income loss per common share   net income loss per common share is computed pursuant to section  of the fasb accounting standards codification  basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period  diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements stock options and warrants   as of september   there are potential share equivalents based on conversion options associated with our convertible promissory notes approximately  potential shares however due to net operating losses sustained antidilution issues are not applicable   cash flows reporting   the company adopted paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for cash flows reporting classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating investing or financing activities and provides definitions of each category and uses the indirect or reconciliation method indirect method as defined by paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of a all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and b all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments  the company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification   subsequent events   the company follows the guidance in section  of the fasb accounting standards codification for the disclosure of subsequent events the company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued  pursuant to asu  of the fasb accounting standards codification the company as an sec filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users such as filing them on edgar   recently issued accounting pronouncements   we have reviewed the fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporations reported financial position or operations in the near term the applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration        table of contents   in august  fasb issued accounting standards update asu no   preparation of financial statements – going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern  under generally accepted accounting principles gaap continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entitys liquidation becomes imminent preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting if and when an entitys liquidation becomes imminent financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with subtopic   presentation of financial statements—liquidation basis of accounting  even when an entitys liquidation is not imminent there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern in those situations financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting but the amendments in this update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events the amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this asu

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is here to
