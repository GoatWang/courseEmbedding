amount donated in  approximately billion beneficiaries anne ray charitable trust and margaret a cargill foundation donor’s background ms cargill was an heir to the cargill corporation fortune the business was established by her grandfather william wallace cargill in  and has grown to become one of the largest private companies with interests in agricultural commodities food production and financial and industrial products and services ms cargill who was  when she died in  left all of her shares of cargill stock to be split between the anne ray charitable trust and the margaret a cargill foundation in eden prairie minn the amount the two nonprofits are set to receive from the bequest totals roughly billion but the way the payout is structured is complex because cargill remains a privately held company officials at the foundation and the trust could not at first liquidate the private cargill stock but that changed last year when the conglomerate sold its percent stake in a publicly traded business called the mosaic company once the company sold its stake in mosaic officials at the nonprofits were able to exchange the private cargill stock for public mosaic stock under this arrangement the foundations ended up with about  million shares of mosaic stock which will eventually provide at least billion to the trust and foundation to receive some of the bequest money right away foundation officials last year sold  million of the mosaic shares for a total of about billion the nonprofits still own about  million mosaic shares but are not allowed to sell them until may  when the sale of those shares is completed the philanthropies ms cargill established could become two of the wealthiest grant makers in the united states ms cargill established the anne ray charitable trust in  with about million to support the american red cross the american swedish institute berea college nature conservancy the public broadcasting service the school for advanced research and the ymca of the usa the margaret a cargill foundation established with this bequest will support a wider array of causes such as animal welfare arts and culture care for the elderly children and their families the environment and other causes those who knew ms cargill describe her as a quiet donor who loathed public recognition for her largess “margaret during her lifetime made almost all of her gifts anonymously” said sallie l gaines a spokeswoman for the foundations “she left very clear directions to our trustees don’t even think of cranking up the pr machine’ she didn’t
