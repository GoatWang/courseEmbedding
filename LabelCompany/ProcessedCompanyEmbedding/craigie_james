i arrived in your office unhappy and unsure of what to do i had a great cancer care experience until the mastectomy and the complications i felt it was best to come clean with my feelings and you have been caring respectful and very sensitive to them  i was bitter which placed you behind the eight ball  you were great with me  my family is impressed and pleased i love the fact that you don’t have an ego  life is precious i cry as i write this note because cancer has been a “death sentence” for young women in my father’s family  my aunt completed breast cancer treatment  years ago and she is very unhappy with her reconstruction  she plans to come from ocean isle beach nc to see you soon  thank you so muchsurgeonsgeneral surgeryeast cooper plastic surgery is a topnotch medical team

about the diep procedure because it seemed like so much surgery to have at once compared to the  csections and hysterectomy that i have had the tummy tuck part of the procedure was a breeze other than a little itching at the suture sites and a tight abdomen i barely knew that i had had surgery on my stomachreconstructive surgeryi had my stage i diep in charleston with drs kline and craigie this last may th  on a scale of  i would rate my experience a   before i go into more detail about my charleston experience though let me go back in time a little bit i had my first unilateral mastectomy in  right side with a reduction on the left side and immediate expanders a while later i had the exchange for the permanent implants  this was all done in atlanta georgia  the process was painful and inconvenient took over a year and was a complete flop  my right breast was half the size of the left terribly scarred and deformed the left breast was oddly shaped and had a very bad fat scar underneath and was hard  the consequences of my low selfesteem led to intimacy problems with my husband which resulted in divorce  several attempts by different plastic surgeons only made the appearance of my breasts worse  the emotional consequences became compounded  in short i felt like a freak  dating was a concept i couldnt even fathom i was so self conscious about my looks  one day  years after my first botched surgery i saw a program on tv that discussed new procedures for reconstruction surgery after mastectomy  i immediately went on line to research the diep procedure and decided to look into the facilities in charleston  i was certain that charleston was the right fit for me  drs kline and craigie are artists and their highly trained staff made each and every step of the procedure flawless  their attention to detail made me feel secure before during and after  im about four months out from stage i now  in those short months my life has been transformed  i havent had my stage ii yet that comes next month but already im walking around with my head up and my shoulders back my breasts look great are soft and warm  and its great to have those implants out  i would also like to add if you are a single woman contemplating a location for reconstructive surgery i highly recommend charleston  the entire staff has a special sensitivity for those of us flying solo
