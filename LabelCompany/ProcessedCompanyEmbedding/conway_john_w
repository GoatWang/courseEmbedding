cork  seal established as crown holdings in  various management positions leading to president and coo – then president chief executive officer and chairman – address crown holdings incorporated  crown way philadelphia pennsylvania  httpwwwcrowncorkcom ■ john w conway became the ceo of crown cork  seal in early  the company was later established as crown holdings in  in  however he faced a series of challenges in placing the centuryold bottling and packaging company on a stronger financial basis in addition to dealing with a recession coupled with rising prices for raw materials energy and transportation crown had to contend with the possibility of bankruptcy due to asbestosrelated court claims conways approach to strengthening the companys financial foundation combined aggressive cost cutting and conservative expansion education and early career conway graduated from the university of virginia and then earned a law degree from columbia law school he went on to hold a series of management positions both in the united states and abroad with the continental can international corporation a metal can manufacturing company before he became continentals president crown cork  seal company acquired continental can in  conway joined crowns board of directors in  and became the companys president and chief operating officer the following year he assumed the position of ceo in january  after the retirement of his predecessor william j avery a press release reprinted by pr newswire quoted avery as saying with john conways experience and his leadership abilities so clearly demonstrated i think this is the time for me to step aside and let john and his management team guide this great company november   a few months later conway also succeeded avery as chairman of the board crown faces bankruptcy conway took charge of crown just as an economic slowdown began to affect the company ranked among the two hundred largest companies headquartered in the united states crown was the leading supplier of packaging products to consumer marketing companies around the world in spite of the companys market share however its stock performance deteriorated as its packaging business slumped conway decided to use a conservative financial strategy while improving the companys balance sheet his strategic plan included a heavy emphasis on cost structure and positioning crown as a lowcost producer conways costcutting measures included the closing of  plants in north america and europe and the reduction of crowns salaried work force he also realigned the production capacity of crowns plant in weston ontario the canadian plant converted two of its existing four aluminum beverage can lines to the manufacture of twopiece steel food cans thus substantially reducing its beverage can capacity pr newswire quoted conway as saying converting underutilized manufacturing capacity … will help capture sales for our food can division and at the same time trim capacity in the beverage can industry february   the asbestos crisis in addition to a slow economy the major challenge facing conway and crown was the threat of asbestosrelated litigation the lawsuits were related to crowns  purchase of a company called mundet which had produced cork bottle caps in addition to insulation that contained asbestos crown was interested only in mundets bottle division and sold off its insulation business  days after it had purchased mundet nevertheless crown eventually paid dearly for its brief period of ownership paying out millions of dollars by mid to settle some  asbestosrelated claims as industry analysts observed other large companies involved in these cases such as owens corning and armstrong holdings were forced to declare bankruptcy causing a ripple effect that left the remaining companies like crown facing an increased share of liability payments settling the legal claims eventually put crown on the verge of bankruptcy conway had the company suspend its quarterly dividend in order to set aside money for payouts the combination of legal claims and packaging business problems led to the companys stock falling over the course of a year from  per share to  per share by april  the legal difficulties were mitigated in december  when the governor of pennsylvania signed a law limiting the asbestosrelated liabilities of crown and other pennsylvaniabased companies conway thought that the general assembly and the governor had made the right decision saying crown does not discount the problem of serious asbestosrelated disease but rather sees the new legislation as a demonstration of fundamental fairness in allocating liability pr newswire december   crown goes global while dealing with the asbestos crisis conway sought out new markets for crown as part of his strategy for maintaining the companys global presence he oversaw the opening of the first beverage can production facility in seville spain as part of crowns efforts to meet steadily increasing market demand in europe conway also signed a longterm agreement to supply nestlé russia with cans for nescafé products in an interview with a reporter from beverage industry  conway remarked crown is committed to supporting customers throughout europe october  by the end of  conway was able to report that the company was on track with its tomonth plan for achieving profitability crowns operating income in  had increased  percent to  million its net income from continuing operations was  per share compared to a  per share in  conway had also increased the companys free cash flow to  million from  million looking ahead conway continued to focus on reducing crowns costs while improving the productivity of its operations and taking a careful and conservative approach to investing he also remained committed to debt reduction crown reported losses of  cents a share for the fourth quarter of  which was an improvement from the pershare loss it had reported in the fourth quarter of  another good sign was that net sales for the quarter were  billion up  percent from a year earlier nevertheless net sales for the year were down to  billion  percent lower than the previous years sales although industry analysts remarked that conway had taken some positive steps to putting the company back on track they also observed that crown was not yet out of the woods the pennsylvania supreme court struck down the states asbestos reform law in march  which meant that crown was once again faced with paying out higher legal claims at the state level and the federal level in addition to conways duties at crown holdings he also served as a director of west pharmaceutical services and ppl corporation see also entry on continental can co inc in

know or even suspect that you have been hurt at work you must act to protect your rights there are requirements of proper and prompt notice to the employer appropriate medical treatment including documentation of your injury and important rules related to work search time periods are shorter than other types of injury cases there are frequent miscalculations made in the level of benefits paid  it is very important that an experienced person review matters such as third party actions permanent impairment ratings the relationship of the potential work injury to other work and nonworkrelated medical problems independent contractor issues fringe benefit issues and special cases such as prior injuries employer discrimination and stressrelated claimsemployment discriminationfor employees what rights do i have if i am fired i’ve been treated unfairly – what do i do i feel that i may have been discriminated against – where do i go and what deadlines do i have to worry about although maine is an atwill state you can be fired for any reason or no reason as long as it is not an illegal reason employees have a number of rights ranging from wage and hour protections to civil rights to employment discrimination employees often have limited time frames in which to exercise their rights and therefore should act quickly if they think they have an issue given the complexity of employment laws our extensive background in employment law is critical to any employee seeking representation we can offer both experience as well as humanistic balanced and dedicated serviceemployment contractemployment maine rest break law in maine an employee may not be required to work more than six consecutive hours without a rest break of at least  minutes   mrsa §  the break time does not have to be paid time an employee may be required to “punch out” for his break  the break is typically used as lunch or other mealtime  it is common for employers to give shorter breaks during the day which must be paid if given but an employer is not required to provide paid breaks an employee needs to be able to rest and eat without work interruption  this is particularly important if the rest time is not paid time as maine wage and hour laws for hourlypaid employees might deem rest time as “compensable” time if the employee is not completely relieved from her duties there are of course several exceptions to the rule  a collective bargaining agreement union contract or other written employment agreement may contain provisions that allow for a different break or mealtime arrangement  there is also a small business exception in the maine statute  the rule does not apply to any place of employment where there are fewer than three employees on duty at a time  an exception exists for emergency situations “in which there is danger to property life public safety or public health”  the law also carves out an exemption for employers if “the nature of the work done by the employees allows them frequent breaks during their work day”  if an employee is free to rest eat use facilities etc during the course of their shiftemployment litigationfor employers an

federal government settles glutenintolerant students’ claims against university for disability discrimination under the americans with disabilities act “ada” it is illegal discrimination for a place of public accommodation including a university to fail to make reasonable accommodations for the disabilities of its patrons or students  the same is true under the maine human rights act and other states’ disability rights laws  some types of reasonable accommodations are quite obvious for example restaurants must provide wheelchair access and handicapped restrooms  a recent settlement between the lesley university in massachusetts and the united states government shows that the accommodations requirement of disabilities laws may also extend to food menu offerings in  students from lesley university in massachusetts filed a charge of discrimination under the ada alleging that the university failed to make reasonable accommodations with respect to meal plans and menu choices to students with a disability in the form of a food allergy – gluten intolerance  gluten is a common food allergy which can manifest into celiac disease in some people  celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder “that damages the lining of the small intestine and prevents it from absorbing parts of food that are important for staying healthy  the damage is due to a reaction to eating gluten which is found in wheat barley rye and possibly oats”  see celiac disease definition us nat’l library of medicine nat’l inst of health adam medical encyclopedia jan   available at httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthpmh  symptoms of celiac disease vary greatly and can include anything from abdominal pain to seizures  the condition can also lead to malnutrition  other types of food allergies suchbusiness and corporate lawbusiness disputesconstruction law most construction contracts contain mediation clauses or other dispute resolution clause setting forth in advance the manner in which disagreements regarding the contract will be addressed maine’s home construction contracts act requires at a minimum a statement allowing the parties the option of adopting a method for resolving contract disputes without the time cost expense and uncertainty that comes with litigation typically the statement sets forth a choice between arbitration or mediation most standard form construction contracts also contain dispute resolution provisions in construction cases many disagreements do not focus on complex legal issues rather they involve such issues as workmanship delay cost and strong differences of opinion and expectations especially in residential cases the parties tend to be emotionally charged and frustrated a welltrained mediator can be a productive neutral force between homeowners who do not take lightly their investment in a significant asset their home and contractors who do not appreciate their workmanship being called into question both parties tend to want to put the matter behind them a properly run mediation session can drive them toward this common goal disputes between contractors and their suppliers or subs can also be detrimental in a business sense in addition to the cost delay and bad feelings litigation can foster important business relationships between the parties can be put at risk maine is a small state a good mediator can help the parties mend fences so that they can

legal issues affecting both owners and contractors involved with residential and commercial construction ventures i          contracts a    written construction contracts whether you are having work performed on your home or your business – or performing work on someone else’s home or business – it is important to have a written contract  in some cases a written contract is legally required such as under maine’s home construction contracts act discussed below  a written contract may not be required by law in certain commercial settings or where the job is for less than   having a written contract is extremely important however in avoiding future disputes which could otherwise come at the worst possible time – in the middle of an unfinished project  all parties benefit from the process of negotiating and drafting a contract setting forth the mutual understandings and expectations  the contract should set forth the specific terms of the project the timeframe the scope of the work involved and the cost and payment obligations  it should contain dispute resolution provisions warranty and insurance information and other projectspecific clauses b    insurance policies  for contractors and other construction professionals it is a good idea to evaluate your insurance protection when entering into contracts for construction work  speak with your insurance agent about the scope of your coverage generally and any projectspecific endorsements that might be required  be sure you understand your policy limits exclusions and deductibles  likewise project owners will want to inquire about insurance coverage before hiring professionals to work on their property ii        maine laws protecting consumers a    home constructionsend to phoneconway john w jd pleasant
