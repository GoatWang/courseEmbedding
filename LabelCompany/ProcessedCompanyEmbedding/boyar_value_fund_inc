 the boyar value fund inc                 dear boyar value fund shareholder performance results following a year of broad based upside across all ten sectors of the sp  ’s leadership again returned to a narrow few with energy  basic materials  utilities  and information technology  providing the vast majority of the gains  if one eliminated the contribution from just energy and materials the index would have declined by –  if you eliminated all four sectors cited above the sp  would have declined by –  the boyar value fund’s negative relative and absolute performance  partially stems from very limited exposure to those sectors the best performing index in the united states in  had the worst record in   the nasdaq posted a  advance however just  stocks  apple google and research in motion were responsible for the vast majority of the gain  the russell  an index consisting of only small companies lost  for the year as we came into  we had modest expectations for the year and felt that some portion of the fund’s  outsized gains could detract from ’s results while we were fully cognizant of the festering housing problems we underestimated the negative reverberations the meltdown would cause the financial sector  financial service stocks led the market lower and finished the year as the worst performing group declining by   two of the fund’s financial holdings performed dismally citigroup  and merrill lynch  and in the aggregate were responsible for a significant portion of the fund’s decline also negatively impacting the portfolio’s  performance were media stocks which provided superior performance during the prior year  the rise in oil prices and recession fears adversely affected some of our retail holdings such as the limited and the home depot on the positive side three companies that the boyar value fund owned were acquired  dow jones advanced  during  and hilton hotels gained  while alltel rose   our best performer was the nasdaq a relatively new holding which advanced by  followed by pepsiamericas  a company we have held for a number of years   bill miller legg mason value trust’s chief portfolio manager quite aptly described last year’s stock market “as being remarkable serially correlated  what has gone up keeps going up and what has not does not  valuation has not mattered at all what has mattered is price momentum  this is very similar to what we saw with tech telecom and internet names in ”  today’s valuations are not nearly as stretched as they were during the dotcom bubbles but they are fast approaching those levels  google apple and research in motion might be wonderful businesses but are they great stocks purchasing a great company at a grossly inflated valuation can empty your wallet especially if you repeat the process enough times  remember successful investing entails two equally important decisions  stocks selection and  valuation     results for the year ended december   calculated without the maximum sales charge of  a look ahead stock market leadership normally shifts quite dramatically in the year following large spikes in volatility such as we witnessed last year   so where will the new leadership come from  the same place it usually does  the old laggards  it is quite possible the new leadership will be us large cap dollar based and grow to encompass what no one wants to own today especially financials housing media and consumer discretionary names with the benefit of hindsight the right investment decision in  was to purchase what investors despised the most  in all likelihood the greatest gains during the next five years will be made in those securities people are most panicked about today at this moment fear dominates the pricing of housing stocks of mortgage related securities of financials and of many consumer stocks as well as housing related issues  confidence and optimism are elevated when it comes to energy material industrials and nonus stocks especially those of emerging markets and china in particular the leading indices are not indicative of the carnage that has occurred in particular sectors  there are a large number of good businesses that have declined by  or more during the past year   every decade or so rare investment opportunities emerge because of panic and fear…we believe this could prove to be such a period in february  prince alwaleed announced his  million citigroup investment  by yearend  citigroup’s shares and alwaleed’s investment declined more than  from their february highs  any investor who followed alwaleed and remained patient was richly rewarded however as citi’s shares peaked at  per share in july  prior to citi’s merger with travelers group in october of that year a gain of more than  times on the original investment while it is foolhardy to predict where the leading stock market indices will be during the shortterm our work indicates that an unusually wide disparity currently exists between the current market value and the intrinsic or private market value in a large number of businesses we follow… some additional thoughts about  a the great recession obsession – can it happen it is certainly a possibility since world war ii there have been  of them or one every six years on average they have lasted  months recessions also have oftenoverlooked benefits – they dampen inflation in weak markets companies cannot easily raise prices or workers’ wages similarly recessions punish reckless financial speculation and poor corporate investments today a us recession might also reverse the upward spiral of oil prices and trigger a faster and healthier drop in home prices … it is quite clear that the slow decline in prices prolongs the housing slump because it induces wouldbe buyers to wait for more attractive deals by making homes more affordable a quick and sharp price drop might revive housing more rapidly b oil has been a great trade for the last five years … energy stocks have been market leaders for four out of the last five years and during that time the price of crude oil has advanced materially without any meaningful correction how long this can go on is anybody’s guess but of late there has been an increasing amount of chatter about how much crude is in the hands of speculators particularly hedge funds as one alternative play after another went sour during the summer and fall a huge amount of money has flowed into the oil futures and options markets the same traders are most certainly also shorting the dollar recent figures tallied by international strategy and investment group show the average daily trading volume of crude oil and products futures at more than  billion barrels – compared to world demand of  million barrels a day this is unprecedented without this unusual amount of speculation and innumerable articles about the vanishing supplies of oil and the upsurge of consumption in china and india oil would most probably be selling at a significantly lower valuation c a dollar rally purely on a purchasing power parity basis the dollar is vastly undervalued … the us is on sale private equity funds are being replaced by sovereign funds and foreigners are becoming the primary acquirers of us businesses with their currencies advancing by as much as  in  versus the dollar and a good number of us listed businesses declining by a like amount merger  acquisition activity driven by these foreign entities could accelerate in  if the dollar remains depressed d housing market improvement the us housing market could get somewhat better towards the end of  as home prices continue their decline and begin to reflect realistic valuations as we have been saying for more than two years the housing glut is a valuation problem similar to the dotcom dilemma and won’t get better until valuations recede materially the tortoise – not the hare – is invariably the winner for value investors shortterm performance can be quite deceiving  those who placed  with the fund manager sir john templeton in  saw their money grow to  by   but during those  years templeton failed to outperform the standard  poor’s index approximately  of the time charles munger vice chairman of warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway at one point in his money management career trailed the market for four out of five years  over a year period however he attained a compound annual rate of return of  versus only  for the sp index it is not unusual for the accounts managed by boyar asset management to under perform the leading indices for multiple years  for example during the technology craze of the late ’s we significantly underperformed the market because we had zero exposure to that sector and felt a collapse was inevitable during the following five years however boyar materially outdistanced the sp  and more than made up for its previous lackluster performance our performance during the recent past has not measured up to the sp   the majority of the underperformance can be attributable to the lack of exposure to cyclical stocks particularly energy and basic materials  we have rarely bought a stock whose business is commodity based  we believe it is very difficult for an investor to consistently make money in this sector over a prolonged time frame our mission is to make money for our clients over extended time frames  under no circumstance will we chase short term performance and invest in the fad of the moment as warren buffett so aptly put it “we can’t promise you investment results but you have our word we will not deviate from an investment style that has worked so well for years” competitive returns average annual returns as of   year  year  year  to  boyar value fund         at nav     inclusive of sales

important to note that historically small and midcap stocks have experienced greater volatility than stocks of larger more established companies additionally valuebased investments are subject to the

potentially the biggest expense an individual mutual fund investor will experience § by holding stocks for long periods of time you postpone paying taxes which positively impacts longterm returns § buying and holding stocks for long periods may sound stodgy but it postpones the payment of capital gains taxes with the added positive effects on the compounding rate since profit taking involves transactions it obliges you to take the irs in as a partner with profits not taken there is a future tax liability but all the money is still working for its owner no transactions no tax § the boyar value fund believes that holding stocks for long periods of time is the best way for an individual investor to create wealth as you can see from the chart below our buy and hold philosophy has enabled the fund to produce after tax returns that pretty much mirror our pretax returns the returns used in the illustration exclude loads but are inclusive of all fees and assumes the highest rates when

may be worth more or less than their original cost current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted to obtain performance information current to the most recent month end please call  boyar value fund philosophy goals § the boyar value fund tends to buy the common shares of publicly traded businesses that are selling in the market place at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic or private market value we will not and never have invested in fads or gimmicks such as the internet § furthermore quite a few of the businesses that we invest in are either not widely followed by the majority of wall street brokerage houses or may have plummeted in value because they failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations § purchasing out of favor companies may inhibit shortterm performance since it may take some time for these companies to right themselves on the other hand we believe that it does create a “margin of safety” since most of these businesses have plunged in value by such a margin that most of the downside risk has been significantly reduced § over an investment time horizon of three to five years it is our hope that these undervalued corporations will be reevaluated upward by the stock market or the assets of the businesses may be acquired by a third party § a longterm orientation may sound stodgy but it is as important to investment success as picking the right stocks and buying them at the right price and at the right time holding the equity of good companies purchased at bargain prices allows compounding to work its magic without the returneroding effects of commissions and capital gains taxes we thank you for your support and wish you a happy healthy prosperous and peaceful new year if you have any

maryland and is registered under the investment company act of  as amended the  act as an openend diversified management investment company   the fund seeks longterm capital appreciation which it pursues by investing primarily in equity securities of companies that are believed by the fund’s investment advisor to be intrinsically undervalued under the fund’s organizational documents its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the fund in addition in the normal course of business the fund enters into contracts with its vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications the fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the fund however based on experience the fund expects that risk of loss to be remote  significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund in preparation of its financial statements  the policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the usa “gaap” securities valuation – securities listed on an exchange are valued at the last reported sale price at the close of the regular trading session of the exchange on the business day as of which such value is being determined and securities listed on nasdaq are valued at the nasdaq official closing price “nocp”  if there has been no sale on such day the security is valued at the mean of the last quoted bid and asked prices  if no bid or asked prices are quoted or if the advisor believes the market quotations are not reflective of market value then the security is valued at a fair value determined in accordance with the pricing and valuation guidelines approved by the board of directors the “board” shortterm debt obligations having  days or less remaining until maturity at time of purchase are valued at amortized cost investments in openend investment companies are valued at net asset value in september of  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb statement no  “fair value measurement” “sfas ” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  sfas  is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  the fund believes the adoption of sfas  will have no material impact on its financial statements   however additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements reported on the statement of changes in net assets for a fiscal period boyar value fund inc notes to financial statements continued december   security transactions and related income – security transactions are accounted for on trade date interest income is recognized on an accrual basis  discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized on securities purchased over the lives of the respective securities dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date realized gains or losses from sales of securities are determined by comparing the identified cost of the security lot sold with the net sales proceeds dividends and distributions to shareholders – dividends from net investment income if any are declared and paid annually distributable net realized capital gains if any are declared and distributed annually dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations which may differ from gaap these “booktax” differences are considered either temporary ie deferred losses capital loss carry forwards or permanent in nature to the extent these differences are permanent in nature such amounts are reclassified within the composition of net assets based on their federal taxbasis treatment temporary differences do not require reclassification federal income tax – it is the fund’s policy to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions of the internal revenue code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains to shareholders therefore no federal income tax provision is required on july   fasb released fasb interpretation no  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes’ “fin ”  fin  provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized measured presented and disclosed in the financial statements  fin  requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the fund’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “morelikelythannot” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority  tax positions not deemed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year  the adoption of fin  had no impact on the fund’s net assets or results of operations use of estimates – the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the

sales charges loads on purchases and redemption fees  ongoing costs including management fees and distribution fees and other fund expenses  this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the boyar value fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from july   through december   actual expenses the “actual expenses” line in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses  you may use the information below together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the table under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the “hypothetical” line in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the boyar value fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the fund’s actual return  the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balances or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads or redemption fees  therefore the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds  in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs would have been higher   beginning account value  ending account value  expenses paid during period  –  expense ratio during period   –  actual     hypothetical

and the advisory agreement the investment company act of  the “ act” requires the fund’s board of directors including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund as that term is defined in the  act the “independent directors” annually to consider the investment advisory agreement between the fund and the adviser and the management agreement between the fund and the manager  as required by the  act the board requested and each of the adviser and the manager provided such information as the board deemed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the agreements  at meetings held throughout the year including the meeting specifically focused upon the review of the agreements held on november   the independent directors met in executive sessions separately from the nonindependent director of the fund and any officers of the adviser and the manager  in selecting the adviser and the manager and approving the continuance of the agreements the independent directors were informed that they are authorized to engage such experts as they consider appropriate including counsel to the independent directors  in this respect the independent directors relied upon comparative fee and expense information produced by lipper inc an independent evaluation service “lipper” both in the meeting that specifically addressed the approval of the agreements and at other meetings held during the course of the year the board including the independent directors received materials relating to the adviser’s investment services under the investment advisory agreement  these materials included information on i the investment performance of the fund over various periods of time compared to the performance of a peer group of funds consisting of the fund and other multicap value funds “performance universe” as classified by lipper and to the fund’s benchmark index ii sales and redemption data with respect to the fund iii the general investment outlook in the markets in which the fund invests iv arrangements with respect to the distribution of the fund’s shares v the allocation of the fund’s brokerage to mark boyar  company inc an affiliate of the adviser and vi the overall nature quality and extent of services provided by the adviser and the manager as part of the review of the continuance of the agreements the board requested and the adviser and manager each provided additional information in order to evaluate the quality of their services and the reasonableness of their fees under the agreements  in a separate executive session the independent directors engaged in an extensive review of information which included data comparing i the fund’s advisory and management fees b fees and other nonmanagement fees to those incurred by the performance universe ii the fund’s average expense ratio to those of its performance universe both before and after waivers iii the fund’s investment performance over various time periods to the average performance of the performance universe and the fund’s benchmark index iv the adviser’s financial results and condition including an oral discussion of the adviser’s and the manager’s and their respective affiliates’ profitability from the services that have been performed for the fund v the fund’s current investment management staffing and vi the fund’s potential for achieving economies of scale  in support of its review of the statistical information the board was provided with a description of the methodology used by lipper to determine the performance universe to prepare its information the following summarizes matters considered by the board in connection with its renewal of the agreement  however the board did not identify any single factor as allimportant or controlling and the summary does not detail all the matters that were considered investment performance  the board reviewed the fund’s overall investment performance and compared it to its performance universe and the fund’s benchmark index  the board noted that the fund’s performance for the oneyear threeyear fiveyear and tenyear periods ended september   was below the performance of the performance universe average and while it was below its benchmark index for the shorter time periods the fund’s performance was above the performance of its benchmark index for the longer time periods  the independent directors expressed their desire that mr boyar continue to manage the fund using the same value style that he has consistently applied during his career personnel and methods  the board reviewed the background of mr boyar the portfolio manager responsible for the daily management of the fund’s portfolio since the fund’s inception achieving the fund’s investment objective and adhering to the fund’s investment strategy  the independent directors also engaged in discussions with mr boyar and his staff who are responsible for assisting mr boyar in the overall functioning of the adviser and ladenburg and members of its staff who are responsible for the overall functioning of the fund’s manager  based on this review the board concluded that the fund’s management team and the adviser’s and the manager’s overall resources were well developed and that the adviser in particular had investment management capabilities and personnel essential to performing its duties under the investment advisory agreement  the board noted the favorable history reputation qualifications and background of the adviser as well as the qualifications of its personnel   fees and expenses the board considered the adviser’s and the manager’s fees under the agreements relative to the management fees charged by the fund’s performance universe averages  the board noted that the fund has a higher overall expense ratio than its peers and relatively high combined managementadvisory fee rates but stated that many of the peer funds were part of significantly larger fund complexes that could spread fixed costs over a larger asset base  the board also noted that the adviser typically charges its other clients an advisory fee at a rate higher than the fund’s gross advisory fee rate and significantly higher than the net advisory fee rate that the adviser receives from the fund after giving affect to the fee waiver   the board noted that the fund’s overall expense ratio before giving effect to the expense limitation had declined since the prior year  with respect to profitability the board viewed favorably that the adviser the manager and the fund’s distributor have since the fund’s inception voluntarily agreed to waive their fees and to reimburse the fund’s expenses in order to keep the fund’s net total operating expenses excluding extraordinary expenses and taxes at  of the fund’s average daily net assets  the board noted that this voluntary fee waiver is currently in place although it can be discontinued at any time  the board understood that after giving affect to the fee waiver the adviser and the manager were able to receive a portion of their respective advisorymanagement fees from the fund  based on these factors the board determined that the fund’s advisory and management fee rates under the agreements do not constitute fees that are so disproportionately large as to bear no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and that could not have been the product of arm’slength bargaining and concluded that the advisory and management fee rates under the agreement are fair and reasonable nature and quality of other services  the board considered the nature quality cost and extent of other services provided by the adviser the manager and their respective affiliates including mark boyar  company for executing securities transactions and ladenburg thalmann  co as the fund’s principal underwriter  at meetings held throughout the year the board reviewed the effectiveness of the adviser’s and the fund’s overall compliance programs  the board also reviewed the services provided by the adviser and the manager in supervising the fund’s third party service providers  based on this review the board concluded that the nature quality cost and extent of such other services provided by the adviser and the manager and their respective affiliate were satisfactory reliable and beneficial to the fund’s shareholders other benefits  the board also considered the character and amount of other direct and incidental benefits received by the adviser the manager and their respective affiliates from their association with the fund  the board concluded that potential “fallout” benefits that they may receive such as greater name recognition and the small amount of brokerage fees appear to be reasonable and may in some cases benefit the fund economies of scale  the board noted that given the current and anticipated size of the fund any perceived and potential economies of scale were not yet a relevant consideration for the fund and the addition of break points was determined not to be necessary at this time conclusion  based on the board’s deliberations and its evaluation of the information described above the board including the independent directors concluded that  a it was appropriate to continue to retain the adviser and the manager b the terms of the investment advisory agreement and the management agreement including the fees thereunder are fair and reasonable and c the fund’s investment advisory agreement and management agreement each should continue for a oneyear period   tax information december   unaudited during the fiscal year the fund paid a longterm capital gains distribution of  individual shareholders are eligible for reduced tax rates on qualified dividend income   for purposes of

morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund

out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund
