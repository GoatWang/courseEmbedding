lungs the pathogen begins proliferating resulting in copd and emphysema read more pulmonary function test spirometry the spirometry test or pulmonary function test measures forced expiratory volume in  second fev and the forced vital capacity fvc which are used in determining the copd stage the patient is in using either the gold system or the bode index the doctor then uses the copd stage the patient is in for predicting their longevity determining the longevity of a copd patient is very difficult since so many factors play a part in determining their life expectancy gold copd staging system there are currently two methods of determining a patient’s copd stage the first and most commonly used method is called the gold system gold is an acronym that stands for the global initiative for obstructive lung disease the gold system uses only one metric in determining the stage of a copd patient fev fev is the forced expiratory volume in  second as determined by a pulmonary function test generally the spirometry test a copd patient’s stage is then determined by the following stage i mild copd fev ≥  normal stage ii moderate copd  ≤ fev   normal stage iii severe copd  ≤ fev   normal stage iv very severe copd fev   normal so in the gold system of staging for copd you are in stage i if your forced expiratory volume in  second fev is greater than or equal to  of your total exhaled breath which is referred to as your “forced vital capacity” or fvc you may also see this expressed as fevfvc in which case the number will be in decimal form for stage i copd the number would be expressed as  so charts that use this fevfvc would show stage i copd as fevfvc   or  of normal the problem with the gold system is that it is just not accurate enough in predicting life expectancy or future symptoms gold only considers the degree of airflow obstruction when other factors may play a big role in determining the actual life expectancy of copd patients that are relying solely on medications when treating their copd alternative treatments are available that can greatly affect and improve a copd patient’s life expectancy those alternative copd treatments are covered in detail on the alternative copd treatments page of this web site below is a link to a complete description of the gold system it is a downloadable pdf if you would like additional informaiton regarding the gold system of staging copd global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease the bode index copd staging the problem with using the gold system in predicting the life expectancy of copd patients who are relying solely on medications for the treatment of their copd is that it does not take into account the body mass index of the copd patient their degree of breathlessness or the amount and degree of exercise the copd patient can perform a newer and much more accurate system for staging copd patients was developed called the bode index bode is also an acronym which stands for bmi body mass index obstruction dyspnea breathlessness exercise capacity health index the bode index uses  metrics in determining the stage of a copd patient determining your bode index score the bode index score is calculated by adding the  metrics mentioned above you will see below that the lower your bode index score the longer your life expectancy put another way the higher your bode index score means the further your copd has progressed theoretically if a copd patient used alternative treatments that resulted in a full recovery their bode index score would gradually decrease until it reached “” this occurred with my mother after the alternative treatments were implemented into her daily regimen we currently have patients in our copd focus group who are scoring a “” on their bode index score most of them were scoring a “” or “” a year earlier body mass index the first of  metrics used in bode index scoring is the body mass index most people have heard of body mass index or bmi but are unsure how it is calculated bmi or body mass index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters bmi  weight kgheight m if you need the calculation for bmi in pounds and inches here it is calculate bmi by dividing weight in pounds lbs by height in inches in squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of  example weight   lbs height   or  calculation  ÷  x    when we incorporate the body mass index calculation into the bode index score we use the following scoring criteria body mass index bmi  points bmi  body mass index greater than   points bmi ≤  body mass index less than or equal to  so we see for our example above with a calculated bmi of  we would add “” points to our bode index score for some people this seems backwards it seems like you should add  point if your body mass index is above  and add  points if it is less than or equal to  the reason it is the opposite of what you may have thought it would be is that copd patients generally lose weight as their copd progresses therefore in general the lighter they are or the more weight they have lost the worse off they are and the more their copd has progressed pulmonary obstruction the second metric utilized in calculating the bode index score is “obstruction” or more specifically pulmonary obstruction the more obstruction a copd patient has the lower their fev or “forced expiratory volume in  second” fev is generally determined by a spirometry test done in the doctor’s office remember that this is the only metric used in determining your copd stage when using the gold system use the following criteria when determining the value you should add to your bode index score fev points fev   points fev   points fev   points fev  mrc dypsnea scale dypsnea means “shortness of breath” an episode of extreme shortness of breath is called an “exacerbation” you will see both of these words thorughout the information detailing copd emphysema chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis and asthma the mrc breathlessness scale the mrc breathlessness scale is to be used by you when assigning the correct grade number to your own breathlessness you will of course want to give yourself an honest assessment you may also want to discuss this number with your doctor and get their opinion after assigning a “grade” to your breathlessness or dypsnea then use the following criteria in determining what number or value you should add to your bode index score mrc dyspnea index  points dyspnea index grade   points dyspnea index grade   points dyspnea index grade   points dyspnea index grade  dyspnea is difficult to quantify but it is necessary if the symptoms of a particular group are to be summarized and compared with others researchers addressed this problem when studying the respiratory problems of welsh coal miners at the medical research council pneumoconiosis unit in the s they devised a short questionnaire that allowed a numeric value to be placed on each subjects exercise capacity the questions were first published in  and rapidly developed into the medical research council mrc dypsnea scale they have been in widespread use since that time exercise capacity the fourth and final metric included in the bode index score calculation is exercise capacity this is determined by measuring the distance the copd patient can walk in  minutes this is easily done at pulmonary rehab on a treadmill points are assigned with regards to the total distance the copd patient can cover in  minutes sixminute walk test  points walks  meters  points walks  meters  points walks  meters  points walks  meters we can see that when the copd patient can walk more than  meters or about  and a half football fields in  minutes we add “” points to their bode index score remember a “” bode index score total means a full recovery calculating the bode index score now that we have all  metrics we can simply add them together and arrive at our bode index score see the following example below for clarification john doe bmi   obstruction or fev   dypsnea grade    minute walk distance   meters we calculate john doe’s bode index score by adding the following bmi   which if we look at the criteria we see that this will add a value of “” to his bode index score his fev   so we look at our criteria and see that this will add a value of “” to his bode index score his mrc dypsnea grade was a “” which adds a value of “” to his bode index score his exercise capacity was  meters in  minutes which adds a value of “” to his bode index score john doe’s bode index score is then calculated by adding the values for each metric as follows value for bmi  value for fev  value for dypsnea  value for exercise capacity the values for john’s metrics are shown below with his bode index score calculated as an           the medical industry uses this bode index score when predicting the longevity of a copd patient remember these predictions assume the copd patient will rely solely on the prescribed drugs and not incorporate any effective alternative treatments into their treatment regimen for this reason and the difference in the lifestyles of copd patients these predictions are not realistic or accurate much of the time much of it depends on whether you take an active role in your recovery or sit passively on the sidelines the medical industry uses the following statistical data as a general rule • more than  of people with mild copd are alive after four years •  to  of people with moderate copd are alive after four years • among people with severe copd fev  normal about  are alive after four years • people with the worst possible copd symptoms including the inability to walk through the house without getting winded along with severe weight loss have the shortest copd life expectancy this is the stage my mother was in when we started the alternative treatments that ultimately saved her life according to webmd “those with stage  or  copd lose at most a few years of life expectancy at age  compared with persons with no lung disease in addition to any years lost due to smoking but current smokers with stage  or  copd lose about six years of life expectancy in addition to the almost four years lost due to smoking” copd life expectancy remember that copd life expectancy varies widely even between people with the same gold system scores from their spirometry or pulmonary function tests and bode index scores even with the most severe emphysema the odds of surviving one year are higher than  your primary doctor or pulmonary specialist lung doctor can provide more detailed information by far the most important determinant of emphysema prognosis and emphysema life expectancy is whether someone continues smoking quitting smoking is the single most important treatment that will improve emphysema life expectancy check out the alternative treatments page for information on increasing life expectancy and even reversing copd completely your doctor will take notice once you get used to calculating your own score in both the bode index and the gold system you will be on a level playing field when talking to your doctor about what copd stage you are in trust me they will take notice the vast majority of their other patients do not know any of this information and can be easily swayed you on the other hand

department as a deputy chief after  years of service to that community at that time he and his wife linda bought a home in derby and started a small business in their basement – bode research group – focusing on public safety strategiesjohn utilized his experience to create modeling software which helps communities determine where to locate fire stations from there the business expanded to church bells a muchloved product in a country with over  churches “it’s a longterm product” john said then the company expanded to time displays at first john was marketing other companies’ products but when they were not meeting the demand of his customers he developed his own lines “we saw an opportunity to make what  customers wanted and it really took off” he saidtoday the time systems can be found at every us military installation in the world tragedies on university campuses have also led to a successful mass communication systems line the company grew from a homebased venture to a location on market street and became brg precision products finally expanding to its current location in the business park on river street its customer base is primarily in the midwest and a companyowned plane helps service customers away from airline routesbrg now has  employees and has continued expansion plans the downturn in the economy squeezed some plans to add employees but at a time when many companies were laying off brg maintained its numbers  among the employees at the company are the bodes’ four children john credits them as the reason it even started – when one of the children asked him for money“we’ll get you a job” he said ––– if you have information on this or other stories contact linda stinnett at lindaderbyinformercom angry  sad  funny  wow  love  × post a comment as
