ticker symbol amhc naic  services for the elderly and persons with disabilities company perspectives improved health is the outcome key dates  american healthcorp is founded to run hospitals  the hospital division is divested a hospitalbased diabetes care program is launched  the company is taken public  the first populationbased diabetes management contract is signed  the company name is changed to american healthways  caresteps inc and empower health are acquired company history american healthways inc is a publicly traded company based in nashville tennessee offering disease management and comprehensive care enhancement programs the company is contracted by health plans physicians medical management organizations and hospitals to help patients better manage their diseases registered nurses maintain regular contact to provide education encouragement and reminders moreover american healthways studies members medical records looking for symptoms that might lead to a particular disease such as diabetes contacts those patients and gives them a chance to enroll in a proactive preventive program more than a million people across the country are served by american healthways programs the approach has been called professional nagging but patients and nurses are known to develop close and caring relationships and the effectiveness of the disease management programs in reducing medical costs and increasing worker productivity are positively reflected on an insurers balance sheet american healthways has experienced tremendous growth since taking on its first contract in  clients now include cigna healthcare wellchoice oxford health plans of new york blue cross and blue shield of minnesota health plus of michigan the principal financial group lowes and us bank companys founding in  american healthways was founded in  as a hospital company called american healthcorp inc by thomas g cigarran senior vicepresident of development at hospital affiliates international along with four other executives from hospital affiliates james a deal henry d herr robert e stone and david a sidlowe the new company then bought four hospitals in tennessee and virginia and in  acquired an alcohol treatment company koala centers the following year the company branched into hospitalbased diabetes programs under the name diabetes treatment centers of america because of a consolidation trend in hospitals american healthcorp decided in  to divest its hospital division and focus on disease management services for hospitals over the course of the next five years the company built up its alcohol treatment division american treatment centers but it was divested as well in  in that same year the company paid more than  million to acquire mwm inc and other assets of the houston center for health promotion american healthcorp went public in  and began trading on the nasdaq in november  it acquired a controlling interest  percent in a newly founded nashville company amsurg corp which would acquire develop and manage specialty outpatient surgery centers in partnership with physicians the centers offered insurers and patients a less expensive alternative to surgery centers in hospitals which were saddled with much higher overhead costs amsurg grew steadily over the next five years and in march  american healthcorp elected to spin off the subsidiary in a taxfree distribution to its shareholders launching a populationbased program in  while amsurg had pursued its niche in the healthcare field its corporate parent concentrated on its diabetes management services in  american healthcorp launched diabetes healthways a populationbasedrather than hospitalbaseddiabetes management program designed for health plans diabetes was a strong candidate for such a service because of the nature of the disease it could not be cured only managed and if not properly cared for a patient could develop a wide range of problems including heart attacks strokes blindness and nerve and kidney damage diabetes was also a leading cause of death in the united states as a result poorly treated diabetes put a strain on the entire healthcare system and drove up costs american healthcorp banked on health plan administrators recognizing that a diabetes management program would save money while offering patients better care american healthcorp may have been the leading diabetes disease management company in the hospital market but its management team was convinced that the future was in the managed care market and elected to invest  million in the development of a managed care product the cost would grow to  million the company would suffer in the short term much to the concern of investors but management remained committed to making the transition in late  american healthcorp signed its first managed care diabetes contract to principal health care a part of principal financial group to service the contract american healthcorp centralized its callcenter operations in  a key step in the growth of the company not only was it able to house more nurses the company gained the advantage of spreading its overhead over a number of contracts thereby allowing it to price its service more advantageously american healthcorp had seen revenues for its hospitalbased diabetes service peak in  at  million then sales fell to  million in  as the company began to make the switch to a populationbased approach during   percent of the companys revenues still came from hospital contracts and just  percent from health plan contracts a year later  percent of revenues came from hospitals and  percent from health plans the company lost  million in  but revenues returned to the  level and more important the company was now well positioned for a return to profitability and longterm growth in  health plan revenues exceeded hospital revenues for the first time  percent versus  percent the company also was gaining credibility american healthcorp was able to document the clinical as well as financial success of its approach in a largescale multisite study confirmed by third parties and subjected to peer review american healthcorp began to expand beyond diabetes it launched a comprehensive cardiac disease management program called cardiac healthways and followed up with respiratory healthways a program to manage respiratory diseases to further promote healthways as a recognizable brand the company late in  decided to change its name from american healthcorp to american healthways inc which took effect at the start of  in addition the diabetes treatment centers of america name was phased out and the companys hospital contracts were now folded into the new brand a new product also would adopt the healthways tag in  myhealthways which was subsequently changed to care enhancement this program moved american healthways beyond chronic disease management to providing a positive healthcare relationship between health plans and all of its members another important step in  was the signing of the first multipledisease contract because a large number of patients suffered from more than one serious ailment and it was unwieldy to assign a separate nurse to work with a patient on each disease there was a clear need for a program that could provide onecall comprehensive disease management a further milestone for american healthways in  was the companys issuance of the first set of disease management standards in the united states by now annual revenues topped the  million mark in  american healthways sold a number of major contracts of particular importance was a tenyear contract the first of its kind in the industry to provide a totalpopulation care enhancement program for blue cross and blue shield of minnesota the program would focus on the  percent to  percent of the members responsible for  percent to  percent of medical costs to accomplish this task american healthways adopted a multipledisease approach with the capability of dealing with  chronic conditions later the care enhancement approach would be rolled out to the plans of more than two million members helping them to prevent disease and maintain a healthy life to help achieve these lofty goals american healthways added to its capabilities by way of acquisition that may american healthways used stock to purchase twoyearold caresteps inc a healthcare management firm that had developed a health risk appraisal tool shortly after the caresteps deal american healthways added to its care enhancement program by acquiring empower health a connecticutbased compiler of market research data johns hopkins approval in  because the healthcare industry had for the past decade offered up numerous costsaving strategies that were also supposed to provide better care doctors and patients alike needed reassurance that the care enhancement program was more than just hype johns hopkins universitys outcomes verification program was brought in by american healthways and blue cross and blue shield of minnesota to study the new program both in terms of cost savings and improved health for members johns hopkins would then be free to publish its findings favorable or not in medical journals in may  the advisory board of johns hopkinss outcomes verification program approved american healthways cardiac and diabetes care enhancement programs the first such approvals since the university established the program in  american healthways received further commendation in june  becoming the first organization to be issued accreditation under the new disease management accreditation program administered by the national committee for quality assurance ncqa american healthways also would be certified by the other major healthcare accreditation bodies urac utilization review accreditation commission issued a full twoyear accreditation for the companys care enhancement programs and jcaho joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations also accredited the program as a result american healthways became the first company to be certified by all of the countrys leading healthcare accreditation bodies moreover in  ernst  young llp completed a study that confirmed savings from  to  percent in total healthcare costs for congestive heart failure patients because american healthways had proven it could deliver both good healthcare and save money there was no wonder that the company began to enjoy a robust business in  it posted net income of  million on sales of  million those numbers improved to  million in earnings and  million in revenues in  revenues advanced to  million and net income grew to  million estimated sales for  were  million as a result of this impressive record american healthways was ranked fifth by fortune magazine in its  list of the nations  fastest growing companies and was also ranked by fortune as the number one fastest growing publicly traded small business in the united states in addition american healthways cracked businessweek magazines  list of americas top  hot growth companies and was added to the standard  poor sp smallcap  index also in  american healthways continued to grow externally it paid  million to acquire status one health systems provider of health management services to highrisk health plan customers after more than  years of heading american healthways cigarran stepped down as chief executive while retaining the chairmanship his replacement ben r leedle although just  was well prepared to take over in september  leedle had played an important role in the companys transformation from a hospitalbased to populationbased company and steadily rose through the management ranks after that after being named senior vicepresident of operations from september  to september  he served as chief operating officer and added the presidency in may  when he was made cigarrans heir apparent he was groomed for the top position over the next year and a half tapped to make presentations and meet with investors leedle also took a course at harvard business school to improve his knowledge of international markets because its methods could be applied elsewhere in the developed world american healthways was already beginning to look to foreign markets for foreign growth in the meantime there were plenty of opportunities in north america the disease management approach to healthcare was still very much in its infancy but american healthways success was already impressive in  the company saved blue cross and blue shield of minnesota  million which allowed the health plan to reduce its cost increase by three percentage points wall street estimated that disease management would soon grow into a  billion
