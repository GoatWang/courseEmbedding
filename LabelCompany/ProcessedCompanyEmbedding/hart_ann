but when you start to think seriously about it and look at what the market has to offer you very quickly realise that you are faced with a huge choice different models are suitable for different purposes and you need to think about the security level resistance grade and physical size of your safe when purchasing a safe you can rely completely on the help and advice of our experts – you will find detailed allround information on security levels and types of safe in the section tips for buying a safe   private individuals and business customers some of our customers are private individuals but many businesses also use and appreciate our products because numerous branches of industry are subject to special requirements laid down by insurance companies it can for example be mandatory to keep certain valuables or documents in a safe banks have always followed this rule of course but many other businesses are now also obliged to use a safe which is also required to meet a certain security level there are a number of reasons why private individuals should invest in a safe firstly of course a safe protects valuables such as jewellery cash or important documents against theft or other unauthorised access secondly a safe with a fire protection rating also provides protection in other situations for example even in the event of a fire the items in the safe are protected against the effects of heat flames and extinguishing water so you will have one thing fewer to worry about    size is important when considering the size of your new safe please remember to plan for future growth first determine which items you want to store in the safe now which will give you the minimum size required however since a safe is a longterm investment it is vitally important to allow room for expansion  if a business now intends to use a safe for the secure storage of important files for example it is possible that other documents will be added as time goes by the same is true of safes in private homes whose owners may add more items of jewellery or works of art to their collections  in addition not only the size of the items stored in the safe is an important consideration but also their value this is obviously an issue that you should discuss with your insurance company to be sure that your cover is sufficient however the safe you choose must also be appropriate to the insurance policy some companies require the insured items to be kept in a safe with a certain minimum security level our experts will be glad to give you the benefit of their wide saferelated experience and advise you about this particular aspect hartmann tresore ag    pamplonastraße     336 paderborn    germany    telefon        infohartmanntresorecom productsburglarproof safesfireproof
