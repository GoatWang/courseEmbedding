the total market share of the hat apparel industry demand for hats actually increased during this period whereas the us market share of hats decreased from  percent to  percent from  to  however the mortal blow to the company derived from intercos response to a hostile takeover bid in  steven and mitchell rales of the cardinal acquisition corporation offered  billion for the company in response to the offer intercos board authorized  billion in additional debt to buyback stock senior management hired goldman sachs  company to restructure the company including a plan to sell  of intercos  companies while this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years from  to  interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent while the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation the full value of these assets was never realized by interco as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds the combination of selling the majority of its companies while being saddled by over  billion in debt created unsustainable negative cash flow resulting in intecos bankruptcy in  thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary international hat was liquidated in

additional debt to buyback stock senior management hired goldman sachs  company to restructure the company including a plan to sell  of intercos  companies while this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years from  to  interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent while the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation the full value of these assets was never realized by interco as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds the combination of selling the majority of its companies while being saddled by over  billion in debt

totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent while the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation the full value of these assets was never realized by interco as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds the combination of selling the majority of its companies while

additional debt to buyback stock senior management hired goldman sachs  company to restructure the company including a plan to sell  of intercos  companies while this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years from  to  interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent while the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation the full value of these assets was never realized by interco as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds the combination of selling the majority of its companies while being saddled by over  billion in debt

harvest straw hats on the microeconomic level st louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the second industrial revolution in   businesses in st louis were producing custom hats for women with approximately  employees in the industry within the decade st louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats international harvest hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in connecticut new york and new jersey the timing of market entry was favorable to the companys goals as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market in  over  million hats were produced in the united states an alltime record for domestic production on the macroeconomic level the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the united states in  the united states economic output for the first time in history was greater than that of the british empire establishing the

center for harvest hats international harvest hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization by the early s the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world in  the company produced over  per day and approximately  million harvest hats per year with the rise of the automobile fashions began to change by the s in  the company expanded into mens straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends in  the company name was changed to international hat company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines in  the

the company was purchased for  shares of interco common stock as a subsidiary international hat continued operation until june   the domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in

the total market share of the hat apparel industry demand for hats actually increased during this period whereas the us market share of hats decreased from  percent to  percent from  to  however the mortal blow to the company derived from intercos response to a hostile takeover bid in  steven and mitchell rales of the cardinal acquisition corporation offered  billion for the company in response to the offer intercos board authorized  billion in additional debt to buyback stock senior management hired goldman sachs  company to restructure the company including a plan to sell  of intercos  companies while this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years from  to  interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent while the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation the full value of these assets was never realized by interco as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds the combination of selling the majority of its companies while being saddled by over  billion in debt created unsustainable negative cash flow resulting in intecos bankruptcy in  thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary international hat was liquidated in

organic foods enjoy walmarts inventory of organic delights which are made without artificial ingredients theyre grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers a food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products like different meats fruits vegetables grains and dairy products organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution the farmers who grow organic produce dont use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds for example organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds so what makes a product organic for certain the us department of agriculture usda established a certification program that requires all organiclabeled foods to meet strict government standards first these standards regulate how such foods are grown handled and processed thus any product labeled as organic must be usda certified you could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one but it s a much easier shopping process when
