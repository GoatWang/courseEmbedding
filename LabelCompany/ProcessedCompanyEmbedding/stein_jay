tanned face a blue shirt with a white collar custommade in hong kong with his initials embroidered on the pocket a grey flannel suit and preppy bright green and pinkstriped tie a gift from his older daughter who followed her fathers career and works as a buyer at ralph laurenbut when he opens his mouth you realize stein is something else a storyteller of how his familys chain of department stores stein mart got its name — the first store in greenville miss was called steins self service but when steins father jake bought more real estate to make the store bigger he wanted a new name steins uncle said he had a friend in arkansas named sam walton who was opening stores and calling them walmartof his realization while walking through a store shortly after becoming ceo for the second time in  that he didnt have to ask a frickin soul about the changes he wanted to make to the store designceo closeup what almost getting fired taught redfin ceo glenn kelmanand of being inspired by other retailers — even calling his director of stores gary pierce during his interview with usa today to have pierce tell the story of stein calling him in excitement from an anthropologie in jacksonville about six months ago after seeing the retailers hardwood floors now the gift departments of newer stein mart stores have hardwood floors and sales are up  there since installing themit looks so damn good stein says in his slight southern accentstein is president and ceo of his familys namesake stein mart a chain of  stores —  as of thursday when another opens in watchung nj — primarily throughout the southeast and texas its headquartered in jacksonville as stein says stein mart does best where the sun shinesthe sun has been good to the department store company which has managed to remain afloat and maintain strong sales at a time when regional department stores have all but disappeared — closed or bought by bigger national players — and struggled to compete with both discounters and the likes of higherend retailers such as nordstrom in the first two quarters of this year sales at stores open at least a year were up  and  respectively the company announced a  increase in sales in september its stock is trading at about  as of wednesday afternoon up more than  from its week lowceo closeup sabres sam gilliland personalizes travelthe chain bills itself as a discount retailer stores feel like a smaller version of macys but with the kind of prices youd find at designer discounters such as tj maxx stein himself compares the company with marshalls or nordstrom rack he says pricing strategy is what sets stein mart apartwhat built this company was values every single day he says he inherited that philosophy from his father and its the first he reinstated when he returned as ceo of the company two years ago after stepping down in  for health reasonsnow stein is focused both on rebuilding his customer base since losing shoppers as the company went through three ceos in  years before he returned and expanding his customer base he plans to open eight to  stores next year many in sunny california the retailer also launched its first ecommerce site last monthin his bloodstein was born into retailing his grandfather sam stein started the company in  with a store in greenville by the time jay was born in  his father jake was running the store sam had died in the si can clearly remember myself at the cash register at  years old stein says it was what you did i didnt think there was anything else to do when you grow up in a small town and your father has a retail store its the center of your lifestein is an only child making the question of who would inherit the family business easy to answer after graduating from new york university in  stein returned to greenville to work for his father for the next  years but they didnt always have the same vision for the companyhe was not an easy man to work with because he had very strong opinions and because he was a product of the depression stein says he clearly wasnt expansion mindedbut when stein saw how much inventory the store received when highend retailers such as saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus had selloffs of their designer goods i said theres got to be other cities that would like this merchandise as well in what today would be called a popup shop stein persuaded his father to let him open a temporary store in the closest big city memphis for selloff merchandise for one whole week the town went wild he says it was very successful that was in  a year later the store became a permanent fixture and led stein marts expansion into a retail chain stein followed up with a third store in nashville in at that point he also had another goal in mind become president of the company stein wanted to join the young presidents organization a professional group that only admits company presidents younger than  this proved an easy feat having no siblings to fight with about titles and a father who only cared to focus on the greenville store stein was  when he essentially appointed himself presidentwe didnt have titles he says it was a family business  nobody objected when he gave himself the rolein the next  years stein expanded the family business to include  stores in  states the company went public in  but after having bypass surgery in  he decided to step down as ceo in september  he maintained his position on the board of directors and meant to act as an adviser that didnt go as plannednobody would listen stein says they didnt want to they thought they had a better plan they were good people they just didnt understand the culturestein mart went through three ceos from  to  when stein was reinstated as interim ceo he was officially named as ceo in juneit was just time to make a change he says of resuming the helm we saw the company was continuing in a direction on a path that i wasnt comfortable with and neither were our customers  neither were our stock holdersstein says merchandise quality had deteriorated and the company was being impersonalizedhe returned to a warm welcome i have never felt as embraced in my life as the day i came back he saysthat personal touchfor stein the business is personal every customer is sent off from the store with a thankyou note from stein printed in his handwriting it reads there is no company more grateful for its friends and customers than we are we have the most loyal base of fans of i think any retailer in america says stein pointing out the companys more than  facebook likes stein is on the road nearly every week traveling frequently to new york city and to visit his stores but hes not necessarily there to see how things are goingim not coming to check on stores im coming to thank people he says we have enough people out there to check on storesstein gave up his yearend bonus last year distributing it to store employees to use for meals out with each other or other activities he says his bonus was the thankyou letters he received from customers in the months following his return to the companythat meant more to me than anything in this world he saysstein marts success may have as much to do with offering customers great deals as with its familial roots and personality stein has an  approval rating on job ratings site glassdoorwhen he returned to the company his wife deanie stein told usa today they would tour stores and could see on employees faces how relieved they werewhile at a store in chantilly va for the usa today interview several employees asked to have their picture taken

 billion in three generationsbeth kowittmar  jay steins family embodies the american dream his grandfather immigrated to the us and opened a general store in greenville miss in the early s some  years later stein began transforming the familys single shop into a chain of department stores that sell upscale brands at bargain prices stein mart smrt has grown into a publicly traded company with  locations in  states and  billion in revenue even after coronary bypass surgery stein  couldnt make retirement stick hes back running the company and seemingly as ambitious as ever his storymy grandfather sam stein immigrated to new york city in  with  in his pocket he came from what was then russia now poland to escape all the persecutions of the day i took the family to ellis island  years later to the day to celebrate after we went to the address listed next to his signature in the logbook and its now right by a louis vuitton store in downtown manhattan he should have bought the buildingmy grandfather was a runner on wall street delivering paperwork but he didnt like new york it was too big and bustling for him so he saved all his nickel tips until he had enough to leave and went to memphis there was this firm that would give immigrants a bag of merchandise  things like needles and thread and socks  and theyd go out sell and send the money back my grandfather would take a steamboat every week down the mississippi delta and sell to farmers and farmhands whatever he could carryrelatedjobsevery state’s favorite job listing buzzwordjobsevery state’s favorite job listing buzzwordhe got off the steamboat in greenville miss and saw that the town was building a new synagogue he said to himself they must be good to their jews here and it looks like a great town he settled and kept going out to the farms until someone in town said you need a general store and lent him the money to do thathe married and had four kids and the store was part of the whole familys life life was really good for our family in this great sweet southern town unfortunately in  during the depression my grandfather had a heart attack and died my father jake the oldest was on a football scholarship at the university of alabama and he quit school and came back to work in the storemore planting the seeds for flowerscomeventually the town expanded and a better location opened up down the street my father told his brother and sister to open up the new store and he would take care of selling out the merchandise in their old space that goingoutofbusiness sale did so well that a light went on for my father he told his brother and sister to keep running the new store and he would make the old space a promotional store he had stumbled on the offprice model that would make us a hit  selling to people who needed great merchandise at really deep discounted pricesi came along in  and my early life was based around school home and working i was always in my dads store something needed to be done you did it we didnt have a lot of job titles in the late s early s we expanded in the same location my uncle was visiting and he asked if they had a name for the new building when my father told him no my uncle said ive got a friend of mine whos opening stores in arkansas his name is sam walton and he calls his walmart thats how stein mart got the name before that it was steinsi went to prep school in jacksonville where i live now and college at new york university i came back to greenville in  and i remember the first day i parked the car crossed the street and i said whats my life going to be like i thought about it for  seconds opened the door and there it was  whatever it was going to bemore the sweet smell of jo malones successthe arrangement wasnt particularly peaceful my father wanted to keep the operation small and didnt think we needed records he felt very comfortable doing business the way hed been doing it the last  years his work ethic was traumatic for me he was a workaholic and would never leave the store when i went on dates on friday night theyd have to start at  pm because my father would still be working and i felt guilty leaving before him my father was a hisway kind of guy and if you deviated at all he wouldnt be pleased on the other hand he was sought after in every respect in the community and in the congregation for his enlightenment but when it came to the store he wouldnt budgepart of our merchandise was selloff from saks fifth avenue and saks kept trying to get us to take more for years i kept talking about opening a store in a larger city and one day my father said lets go look in  we went to memphis and found a vacant squarefoot space my father looked at it and said well take half of it i said what are we going to do with half of it we ought to take the whole thing right in front of everybody we went at it again the landlord made it economically feasible so we could take all of itopening day was magical thousands of people showed up everyone would go straight to ladies apparel i said oh my god were going to run out of ladies goods in three days i went back to new york to buy more merchandise and didnt know where to begin i was introduced to phil dobular a buyer who specialized in offprice deals and was in between positions he knew everyone in the new york market he was and still is the funniest individual who ever lived the combination of brooklyn and greenville was unbeatable he worked with me for  yearsmore hobie alter  founding father of the surfing industryin greenville wed hire our friends wives who wanted to work during saks promotions they saw the merchandise first and got discounts on opening day in memphis this lady jane carruthers comes to me she was right out of the junior league  the apex of memphis culture and society she said can i work here ive got a few friends that would like to too they were the most charming lovely four ladies ive ever met that was the birth of the boutique program  wed hire local women and they would spread the word it gave us wonderful credibility and they enjoyed it whenever wed open a store the boutique program just worked it was a really important part of our early growthwe started to focus more on systems and processes our first hire in memphis was a fabulous manager carl davis he helped us enormously and took us to the next level he started doing inventory management which my father didnt want in greenville at that point we needed more expertise we hired jack williams between stores no  and  to handle operations my father said whats he going to do my father didnt understand it if he wasnt going to work on the floor selling but my father would listen to jack and respected him sometimes his most important function was telling my father we were going to open a new store jack was a friend counselor and partner he semiretired three years ago but he still comes into the office almost every daywe hit no  and kept going we went public in  with about  stores we did the ipo to attain personal liquidity for our family and establish a currency for expansionmore the rise of the tweezermani had a bypass  years ago and thought maybe i shouldnt do this day to day and maybe theres other people who can do it better we tried with three different ceos and failed for every available reason they werent merchants youve got to have a merchant running a retail operation after our third unsuccessful try i took the position of interim ceo sixteen months into it a reporter came to me and asked when are you going to drop the interim title i said right now i didnt realize the consequences and our general counsel came in and said we have to make a public announcementour folks really embraced me coming back its just been perfect weve got the best organization weve ever had im a lot happier than i was the first time we built it im more secure more selfassured now were at  stores and were going to open about  this year and  next year i think we can double our size one day well find a business partner that can keep the same standards and atmosphere and well merge our company im in no hurry and im very particular well do the right thing its legacy its got our name on itmy advice people work with you not for you in the early days if we had made the wrong hire just once we would have been done hire good people who are a lot smarter than you are treat them well love them and embrace themlocation location location when you make a bad buy as a merchant it can take six weeks to sell out but a bad buy in real estate can take  years to get out of bad locations cost you a lot of moneygrow slowly we got to  stores and said perhaps we can open  more dont wake up one morning and say you want  stores because youll
