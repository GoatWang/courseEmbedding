the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered company” rule f under the act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the act requires shareholder approval  form na is the registration statement used by openend investment companies item a of form na start printed page requires a registered investment company to disclose in its statement of additional information the method of computing the “advisory fee payable” by the investment company including the total dollar amounts that the investment company “paid to the adviser aggregated with amounts paid to affiliated advisers if any and any advisers who are not affiliated persons of the adviser under the investment advisory contract for the last three fiscal years”  rule a under the act requires proxies solicited with respect to a registered investment company to comply with schedule a under the exchange act items cii

protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below  applicants assert that the shareholders expect the adviser subject to the review and approval of the board to select the subadvisers who are in the best position to achieve the subadvised series investment objective applicants assert that from the perspective of the shareholder the role of the subadvisers is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company applicants believe that permitting the adviser to perform the duties for which the shareholders of the subadvised series are paying the adviser—the selection supervision and evaluation of the subadvisers—without incurring unnecessary delays or expenses is appropriate in the interest of the subadvised series shareholders and will allow such subadvised series to operate more efficiently applicants state that the investment advisory agreement will continue to be fully subject to section a of and rule f under the act and approved by the board including a majority of the independent board members in the manner required by sections a and c of the act applicants are not seeking an exemption with respect to the investment advisory agreement  applicants assert that disclosure of the individual fees that the adviser would pay to the subadvisers of subadvised series that operate under the multimanager structure described in the application would not serve any meaningful purpose applicants contend that the primary reasons for requiring disclosure of individual fees paid to subadvisers are to inform shareholders of expenses to be charged by a particular subadvised series and to enable shareholders to compare the fees to those of other comparable investment companies applicants believe that the requested relief satisfies these objectives because the advisory fee paid to the adviser will be fully disclosed and therefore shareholders will know what the subadvised series fees and expenses are and will be able to compare the advisory fees a subadvised series is charged to those of other investment companies applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief would benefit shareholders of the subadvised series because it would improve the advisers ability to negotiate the fees paid to subadvisers applicants state that the adviser may be able to negotiate rates that are below a subadvisers “posted” amounts if the adviser is not required to disclose the subadvisers fees to the public applicants submit that the relief requested to use aggregate fee disclosure will also encourage subadvisers to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the adviser if the lower fees are not required to be made public  for the reasons discussed above applicants submit that the requested relief meets the standards for relief under section c of the act applicants state that the operation of the subadvised series in the manner described in the application must be approved by shareholders of a subadvised series before that subadvised series may rely on the requested relief in addition applicants state that the proposed conditions to the requested relief are designed to address any potential conflicts of interest including any posed by the use of whollyowned subadvisers and provide that shareholders are informed when new subadvisers are hired applicants assert that conditions    and  are designed to provide the board with sufficient independence and the resources and information it needs to monitor and address any conflicts of interest with affiliated persons of the adviser including whollyowned subadvisers applicants state that accordingly they believe the requested relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  before a subadvised series may rely on the order requested in the application the operation of the subadvised series in the manner described in the application including the hiring of whollyowned subadvisers

volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially
