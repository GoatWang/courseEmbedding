our chairman president and chief executive officer jim will begin by providing an overview of our performance then i will review our financial results before turning it back to jim to discuss our outlook after that we’ll open the call for your questions jim james l janik thanks bob and good morning everyone thank you for joining us we closed the year with solid results especially given that the winter hasnt been very cooperative in our core markets for the second consecutive year our fourth quarter results were driven by the addition of the work truck solution segment in july and continued strong performance at henderson which was partially offset by lower sales work truck attachment segment as we expected for the fourth quarter net sales were approximately  million producing net income of approximately  million or  per diluted share following two successive years of record results combined with very low snowfall coming out of the previous winter of  and  we didnt anticipate reporting record results for our commercial snow and ice products for third year in a row the teams at western fisher and snowex have done an admirable job working through the tough weather conditions and we are pleased with their performance under the circumstances im also delighted to report that the henderson team continued their strong track record of growth and produced another record performance for  on a positive note we continue to see pockets of dealer optimism about their  prospects despite low snowfall in most parts of the country we expect this winter to end with below average snowfall totals overall if you want to look in more detail snowfall was inconsistent both in location and in timing for example october and november were very warm and saw a little winter weather december returned to strong snowfall in some of our core markets which resulted in average fourth quarter snowfall across north america overall as five of the six months of winter are over while some markets in the northeast saw only slightly below average snowfall we are going to be well below average across north america for the second year in a row chicago is an extreme example with no measurable snowfall in january or february for the first time on record these factors will undoubtedly have an impact on the preseason order period for our commercial snow and ice control products however our most recent look at dealer field inventory taking at the end of january indicated inventories were only marginally higher than the same time in  which is inline with our expectation and bodes well for the coming year as many of you know we also track select north american pickup truck sales the latest data shows continued growth with select north american pickup truck sales increasing  in january  when compared to january  overall the takeaway should be that the nonsnowfall indicators continue to look positive for our commercial products of course this was also our second quarter including results from our work truck solutions segment which we acquired in midjuly adding this complementary portfolio of services and products is helping to drive deeper customer relationships and strengthens our geographic footprint it has really rounded out our offering and has expanded our capabilities into a full range of commercial work truck vehicles the work truck solution segment performed in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter and we continue to expect great things from that team going forward as many of you are also  are already aware that douglas dynamics management system or ddms is an important factor that differentiates our company continuously improving service and quality for our customers is not so secret secret ph is our success it will continue to be instrumental in driving value creation opportunities with any acquisition we complete weve made good progress with trynex and henderson and are off to a good start with work truck solutions as well having said that we continue to refine ddms in our commercial snow and ice control business where the progress began more than  years ago so as weve done each quarter for the past year or so id like to share an example of a recent ddms initiative an important component of ddms is education in  our commercial snow and ice control teams are implementing what we are calling a change agent development program through training and education we will enhance the ability of another  associates to drive performance improvements in critical areas of growth margin quality delivery and safety this train and view approach will follow three critical learning modules in addition to each classroom training session teams will also deploy in the field within our manufacturing supply chain product development and support functions to identify and implement improvements the three highly focused modules will build on each other in specific order first standardizing work stable and predictable defined processes where waste can be easily identified than secondly measuring results the ability to use highly accurate data to further define and prioritize opportunities and then finally implementing solutions structured tools and techniques that teach proactive root cause problem solving to drive new levels of performance and sustained improved results the program allows us to multiply the number of improvement activities we can undertake but in a very controlled and systematic manner essentially we will be empowering many more people at all levels of the company with the knowledge to improve customer experiences in the early stages of this program our newest change agents have already increased productivity in two of our assembly cells by up to  they have proved several opportunities for improved first pass yield and made complex safety and ergonomic enhancements its important say that this kind of process will never stop at our company the idea that all the ripe fruit has been picked does not work for us we can always improve now i’d like to discuss our dividend as we reported on december  we paid a quarterly cash dividend of  per share on the company’s common stock on december   once again the board and the management have agreed it is appropriate to increase the dividend this year and have declared a quarterly cash dividend of  per share for the first quarter of  which equates to a projected full year annual increase of  per diluted share the dividend will be paid on march   to stock holders of record on march   aside from the dividend we remain committed to using our excess capital to reduce our debt and pursue strategic acquisitions we are continually tracking companies that would be a good strategic fit with our offering and we will pursue logical deals while maintaining our disciplined approach as we have always stated we focus on the factors within our control our flexible business model enables us to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and utilizing ddms allows us to improve every year while  unfolded better than we had imagined at the start of the year the implementation of our low snowfall playbook was an important part of our plan and we will be continuing to use the playbook this year as i just mentioned we are continuing our ddms journey in our core operations and are entering a crucial second stage with our henderson brand as initial success has to be translated into ddms becoming engrained in that business the first two quarters with work truck solutions has produced promising results but again there is a lot more we can do to address new opportunities in that segment with that i’ll turn the call back over to bob to discuss our financial results in more detail bob robert mccormick thanks jim before i began i just want to remind everyone that we created two reporting segments in the third quarter of  first the work truck attachment segment which includes our original business focused on manufacturers snow and ice and fleet ph equipment for both the municipal and commercial markets and second the work truck solutions segment which resulted from the acquisition of dejana and includes the upfit of market leading attachments and storage solutions for our commercial work vehicles also as you will see in this press release our results for the full year include the impact of the work truck solution segment for the period of july   through december   following the completion of the deal with that said let me walk you through the results overall the results were positive and in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter of  net sales were  million representing a  increase over the same period last year the increase reflects the addition of work truck solutions and strong results from henderson which was partially offset by lower sales for our core commercial snow ice control products as a reminder we are comparing fourth quarter  to our alltime record performance in the fourth quarter of  as we mentioned last quarter the work truck attachment segment shipments to the former dejana operations were originally treated as an intercompany inventory transfer and revenue was deferred in the third quarter some of that revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter as endusers were shipped products from the work truck solutions segment and we expect this process to continue in q of  for the fourth quarter of  corporate sales were  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in the fourth quarter of  this yearoveryear increase was driven by the addition of work truck solutions sga expenses of  million for the quarter of  compared to  million in the same quarter of  again this increase was due to the addition of work truck solutions moving on we produced adjusted ebitda of  million for the fourth quarter similar to adjusted ebitda of  million for the fourth quarter of  the slight decrease reflects the addition of the work truck solutions business offset by lower sales in our more profitable commercial snow and icecontrol products net income was  million or  per diluted share in the fourth quarter of  compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share in the same period of  the decrease in net income relates to lower overall sales of work truck attachments coupled with higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales in the work truck solutions segment compared to work truck attachments the effective tax rate for the full year  was  compared to  for  the higher rate relates to the release of valuation allowances in several states in  resulting from consecutive years of taxable income in those states that were not available on  now let’s briefly look at earnings information for the two segments for the fourth quarter  the work truck attachments segment recorded revenue of  million and income from operations of  million well in line with internal expectations and very similar to third quarter  numbers these results were lower when compared to the same period last year due to the impact of below average snow fall this past winter it’s worth reiterating that within the work truck attachments segment our henderson brand continued to grow and outperform its excellent  results next the work truck solutions segment we recorded revenue of  million and  million of income from operations all of these numbers were aligned with our initial internal expectations for the full year  net cash provided by operating activities were  million compared to  million of  the increase was driven by favorable working capital changes and the proceeds of the favorable legal settlements in the first quarter which were partially offset by the acquisition cost related to dejana accounts receivable at the end of the year were  million compared to  million at the end of  this includes the work truck solutions ar which was partially offset by a decrease stemming from lower overall sales in the work truck attachments segment capital expenditures for  totaled  million which includes the purchase of the new illinois up fit facility for henderson which we mentioned in august also please remember that  full year capex of approximately  million included the milwaukie facility improvement project going forward we expect our annual capex to range between  million and  million which reflects the addition of work truck solutions inventory was  million at the end of  compared to  million at the end of  and in line with third quarter of  the increase in inventory is primarily due to the acquisition of work truck solutions which was partially offset by a decrease in inventory for the work truck attachment segment related to anticipated lower overall sales in  the company maintained cash on hand in  of  million compared to  million on hand at the end of  it is important to note that we deployed  million of cash during the year to help fund the dejana acquisition additionally we just recently replaced our total debt lowered our interest rates  basis points saving over  million in annual cash interest expense total liquidity at the end of the year was approximately  million which includes  million in borrowing capacity on the revolver plus  million in cash overall we are pleased with our  results we are wellpositioned for continued success in  and stand today as a stronger company with the more diverse set of products and services with that ill turn the call back over to jim james l janik thanks bob as we look into  we feel positive about our business and our long term prospects for the future for our commercial snow and ice control brands we continue to see positive nonsnowfall indicators such as positive light trucks sales low inventories and positive dealer sentiment all bode well however while winter isn’t over yet so far we have seen below average snowfall across north america again the season started very late for the second year in a row and weve experienced inconsistent and variable snowfall across our core markets when viewed in aggregate across the past six months we do expect to see below average snowfall winter again which will impact our preseason period in contrast backlog data and ongoing discussions with customers provide us good visibility with our henderson brand that  will see continued growth however unrelated to our operations we are experiencing a delay in receiving truck chassis from two oems which of course is delaying our team from completing and delivering some trucks to customers while we are seeing signs that this situation is rectifying itself during the calendar year we are likely to see more variability from quartertoquarter for henderson products this year typically henderson produces fairly consistent results across the four quarters but for  we expect revenue to skew towards the back half for the year in addition while we generally expect the work truck solution segment to grow at a mid to high singledigit rate over the long term we have seen some temporary softness in the first two months of the year related to dealer sales of class  to class  trucks and created our outlook with that in mind looking at  as a whole we do expect to breakdown of our results between quarters to be different to previous years due to the changes in the overall structure of our business and the near term factors noted above in summary we expect both revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted primarily in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter by the items noted above we expect the back half of the year to be much stronger in terms of both revenue and profitability turning to the actual numbers which are outlined in the release based on our recent results to the overall economic climate plus the items already mentioned we expect net sales for the full year  to come in between  million and  million this should produce adjusted ebitda in the range of  million to  million which would translate into an eps of between  and  in conclusion we expect  to be an important year of execution the additions that we made the last year will continue to be key focus as we integrate the work truck solutions team and address the market opportunity while we have made a great start we still have a lot of work to do our work truck attachment business remains wellpositioned for continued success we do not take our market leadership for granted we will continue to implement customer focus improvements to ensure continued success for the years to come we are now ready to take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction our first question is from the line of josh chan of baird your line is open josh chan hi good morning jim and bob thanks for taking my question james l janik sure josh josh chan hi yes so for the quarter i was wondering if in the attachments business you could give some color in terms of how accessories did relative to equipment in terms of that attachment segment james l janik so let me make sure that i understand your question how did parts and accessories do relative to the attachment segment josh chan correct yes parts and accessories and then i guess versus the equipment within that segment james l janik yes so what’s interesting is in low snowfall period service parts as well as equipment tend to work in unison i would say that service parts and accessories was probably a little bit softer than we anticipated and thats entirely because the products overall in q we’re not used quite as much as they normally would be so they were a little bit softer josh chan okay where they softer than the segment average i suppose james l janik i don’t know but i can answer that it isnt obvious i haven’t seen those numbers but it wasn’t  i guess the way say it is it wasn’t surprising and it wouldn’t be unusual compared to what the weather situation was josh chan okay great and then on the henderson delay what was the driver behind the delay shipment it sounds like it’s not related to what you are doing but kind of  what are you seeing in the beginning of the year here james l janik sure what we are seeing is there are two oems in particular i wont name them but they are having some production issues one has got some design issues and the other ones just having capacity issues and what thats creating is sort of a lock jam in the industry for those vehicles and as a result we’re beginning to see that lock jam break a little bit but it is hampering our ability to complete our trucks and then get them shipped josh chan okay james l janik but it’s again nothing that we’ve done we are in close contact with them but this is something that is an issue for other people who do similar things in the work truck industry josh chan right got you okay and then my last question is on the attachment segment it looks like you are able to improve margins for the year just by having revenue so what was the driver behind the margin improvement there and how are you thinking about margin looking into next year as revenue probably comes down a bit too robert mccormick yes couple of things there i think one of the thing that is one the hallmarks of our core business is that when snowfall is below average and we are not spending as much time making product to ship we double down on ddms type improvements and  was a significant cost reduction year for our core business we also did enjoy for the first half of the year some nicely below average fuel cost those are ticked up in the last six months or so but there was a positive impact there for a while but i would go back to just what that team does when they are in the low snowfall environment as we just double down on reducing cost and improving quality and positioning ourselves so that when the snowfall comes back we can produce and ship high quality product at even higher margins then we have the year before and i would expect that team in the  in a similar snowfall cycle to take a similar approach josh chan okay great good job on the yearend and best of luck as far as next year james l janik thanks josh operator thank you our next question is from the line of jim giannakouros of oppenheimer your line is open jim giannakouros hi jim and bob james l janik good morning robert mccormick good morning jim giannakouros so i think on core we did some checks and we got mixed messages obviously mild winter was a parent second one in the row trying to get a feel for what the preseason is going to look like for you guys certainly q my sense is and please tell me your thoughts is that inventories are lean so i think distributors manage inventory down to the extent that they could and that might actually help the preseason picture as opposed to what we would have thought maybe a down   type of a preseason on core is that an offset we should be thinking about and then also  your comments and our checks with your closest competitor that kind of intimated or suggested that things arent that bad from what this past winter afforded them james l janik yeah i think from our perspective youre right there are some puts and takes inventory levels are low but again equipment didnt get used a lot in the past winter so as you think about our business as replacement cycle business were comfortable that there will be very good very decent replacement but it wont necessarily be driven until we get into later in the year until we see what kind of sellthrough comes through i think in general december was a good month for everybody in the industry because it was a nice month i would say december was probably the only month people are talking about success this winter they had pretty good success in december as we did but once you combine that with october november january february its a significantly below average snowfall year but december was a very good month for everybody jim giannakouros got it okay so if i can ask another way or more pointedly embedded in your guidance how should we be thinking about whats in your plan or thoughts on the core specifically in  james l janik yeah its going to be certainly from our perspective its a second soft snowfall year in a row and i think what were going to see as were hopeful inventories are low but again we manage for average snowfall and then we adjust accordingly so were going to really have to wait and see what takes place i think the only way i can really give you any guidances is that it wont be the worst year weve ever had and it wont be the best year weve ever had it will be somewhere in between jim giannakouros okay and since you have two segments now i mean can you give us some ranges at least as to the per segment contribution in  to your sales and ebitda ranges that youve put out there on a consolidated basis james l janik i dont believe were going to provide guidance for each of those segments jim jim giannakouros okay all right thanks guys james l janik thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of steve dyer of craighallum your line is open steve dyer thanks good morning guys thanks for taking my question within the  you had mentioned starting to see a little bit of softness is that something you could i guess elaborate on is that sort of certain customers or certain segments or how should we think about that james l janik yeah theyve got multiple end user segments and what weve seen late fourth quarter into the first quarter is their dealer direct business where they up pick vehicles per truck dealers in the east coast that is softened up retail inventory levels are higher ever than the dealer equipment wed like them to be and theyre slowly working through that so that comment was specific to the truck dealer business that they do the other segments of their end user customer base whether its lease or its leasing companies or its van up thats  orders are fairly robust there there is a lot of activity when you get the new budgets approved for the calendar year there is a lot of quoting that takes place in q for the fleet and for the leasing companies and we have a lot of good momentum there so the one segment of their business has been soft for  days or so we need to work through that but have been said all that we are still as thrilled with the near term and longterm growth prospects of this acquisition and we look forward to speaking with you about some pretty exciting things as the year unfolds steve dyer great and i noticed you did sort of higher ebitda margins in the last couple of quarters with dejana than sort of the midpoint of this next years range i am just wondering if that’s conservative or more of there is something maybe not progressing there on an operational standpoint as well as maybe you had hoped james l janik i wouldn’t frame it that way i would say that’s going back to the dealer update softness that happens to be a higher margin profile in that segment of their business so its just a really a mix issue from that point of view ddms implementation there is progressing nicely we highlighted last quarter the couple of things that are really cool going on there so its really just this dealer business softness that is impacting margins little bit in  steve dyer okay great and then i guess lastly can you just remind us around seasonality of dejana just given that it’s been about a quarter and a half now how should we think about that flow throughout the year james l janik it is i would say it’s closer to     but the first quarter is probably the low s the fourth quarter is between  and  and then q and q kind of settled right in between those two so its much more predictable and much more stable but stronger in the fourth quarter than it is in the first quarter steve dyer okay got it thank you james l janik thank you robert mccormick thanks steve operator thank you our next question is from mike shlisky of seaport global your line is open michael shlisky good morning guys can you hear me okay james l janik hey mike michael shlisky all right great just want to follow up on the last question first of all can you just give us a sense as to overall for the whole company whats the kind of go forward transition earnings if you just kind of confirm that this year will not be the same as what you expect in other years for your earnings calendar james l janik mike i am sorry but i had a difficult time hearing the question could you please repeat that again michael shlisky sure could you tell us what is the overall company more normalized calendar for earnings going forward not just for dejana but the overall company sort of any first half second half or kind of by the quarters can you just confirm that this year will not be inline with that sort of longterm you have given what’s going in dejana this quarter robert mccormick we haven’t and we’ll likely not give quarterly guidance in terms of how the total company financials breakdown by quarter i think if it take we just spoke about in the work truck solution segments if you add jim janiks comment about henderson having some truck availability issues that’s going to push some of their business out of the first quarter and into the back half of the year you’re going to see a little bit stronger back half of the year from douglas than you normally would and likely a little softer first half of the year i think that’s an appropriate signal for us to send at this point i think when you look at our full year guidance even given below average snow fall two years in a row we still got some pretty exciting things that are on the horizon in  michael shlisky okay that’s fine i just want to ask about the indiscernible issue that you had mentioned earlier as well just a little more color there the one oem and there is having some design problems is it that the designed is now work with your attachments or its overall truck itself thats now your indiscernible this year than the one  sorry robert mccormick the issues are has nothing to do with compatibility with our product it just did  it’s in the truck design itself and the performance of the truck portion of the vehicle not in how it relates this is frankly nothing to do with douglas this just has to do with class  and class  truck availability michael shlisky okay i am sorry is it a model changeover problem or is it a product quality that they are having do you think robert mccormick well again i don’t want to get into too much detail but one of them few years ago cut back capacity so far because of the downturn that now as trucks are becoming much more popular again they are having a difficult time meeting the domestic growing demand which they’re working on and the other one the other manufacturer actually have some performance issues in their current vehicle and theyve slowed production down until they fixed those problems michael shlisky okay that’s fair just can you just also just give a little more color on your ma outlook for the year obviously you are going to keep up pursuing targets as you always do but kind of give us a sense as to  just update us as to whether you probably doing this outside of the weather related attachment area or you been doing it inside weather attachments and are there any areas that you don’t serve yet and  that which we should be thinking about james l janik can you repeat your question one more time it seemed like there were a couple of questions in there i want to make sure what the question was michael shlisky sorry i’m in a very lot of convention ph right now just kind of curious can you just tell us about your ma outlook are there any areas of weather related attachments that you don’t currently serve right now or are you looking for areas outside of the weather world for your next target for ma james l janik yeah we’ve talked about this before we don’t have any specific time table for acquisitions we tend to be more opportunistic and again from our perspective the strategic opportunities could and can exist in nonweather related businesses but there may be some opportunity that comes up in a weather related business that just fits us perfectly so at this particular point what i will say for ’ is we continue to look for really good opportunities but right now i think we’re incredibly focused on integrating two of the more recent opportunities so yes we’re looking but we’re also absolutely focused on integration michael shlisky okay thanks very much guys i will leave it there james l janik all right thank you operator thank you operator instructions im not showing any further questions at this time i’d like to turn the call back over to mr jim janik for any further remarks james l janik for all of you on the phone thank you for your interest in douglas dynamics we look forward to speaking with you about our
