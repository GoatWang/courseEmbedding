marriage by entry into the armed forces or by living independently many states also impose child support obligations on parents for a year or two beyond this point if the child is a fulltime student

the other parent must make payments to the custodial parent on behalf of the child  usually cash but sometimes other kinds of contributions when parents divorce the court almost always orders the noncustodial parent to pay the custodial parent an amount of child support fixed by state law sometimes however if the parents share physical custody more or less equally the court will order the
