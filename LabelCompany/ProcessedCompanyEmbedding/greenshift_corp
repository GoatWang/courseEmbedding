been at the heart of what greenshift is accomplishing create an elegant costeffective and valueadded product that takes advantage of what was once deemed a waste stream or otherwise low value coproduct that is what greenshift has done with all the technologies within its portfolio and what it will continue to do moving forward but evaluating waste streams for value added products is just the beginning in order maximize value continuous innovation is needed and that is what greenshift has strived for in the numerous engineering and technology solutions it is brought to commercialization corn oil extraction the most established technology within greenshift’s portfolio is the crowning example of turning an otherwise low value coproduct into a highly sought after commodity in other markets greenshift’s cost effective and elegant design has transformed an industry and in many cases allowed businesses to survive in otherwise difficult financial times biodiesel production once relegated to only producers with integrated soybean crush facilities has seen tremendous growth over the last  years this has been a direct result of sourcing reliable new feedstocks further improving upon this model has been the ability for ethanol producers to take advantage of onsite infrastructure energy and logistics capabilities to colocate biodiesel production at their facilities this has ushered in a new wave of renewable fuel ‘complexes’ that look to increase renewable fuel production from the same mass of grain while the focus initially has been on the renewable fuel market greenshift has always looked to evaluate waste streams and otherwise low value byproducts in other industries one such industry is pulp and paper production where black liquor concentrate presents another opportunity to extract a highly valuable complex polymer known as lignin contained within an otherwise low value byproduct stream such a process would also have far reaching implications for renewable fuel production where cellulosic feedstocks are used and lignin is contained within its byproduct stream as greenshift continues to evolve as a company its core belief that innovation drives growth will not change being satisfied with the status quo is not something greenshift strives for but rather the insatiable desire to develop and commercialize efficient technologies that bring otherwise unrealized profits to an industry menu corn oil extraction process description biodiesel lignin recovery request for quote about us greenshift develops and

construction marketing request for quote news investors sec filings xbrl reports intellectual property resources careers contact about us history greenshift corporation was founded on january   and is organized as a delaware limited liability company from the onset greenshift has always focused on improving process efficiency through innovative engineering solutions initially greenshifts core business was specialty drying however its extensive experience in innovative process technology led to the discovery of its patented corn oil extraction technology from  to  extensive research and development was conducted to fully commercialize greenshift’s corn oil extraction technology culminating with two commercial installations in  as our mission statement outlines greenshift did not stop innovating and proceeded to perfect its extraction technology while adding additional intellectual property to its portfolio to increase corn oil yields in june  greenshifts third commercial installation was completed and was closely followed by three additional installations in  by this time greenshifts backend extraction process was viewed as the quickest and most cost effective solution for ethanol producers to increase revenues and was beginning to experience widespread adoption across the industry in october  greenshift received a patent issuance on its first corn oil extraction patent from the us patent and trademark office it has since received numerous additional patents related to its corn oil extraction processes and other clean technologies currently greenshift has installed or licensed its patented corn oil extraction process to  ethanol facilities across the globe roughly  of the current cornbased dry mill ethanol industry has adopted backed corn oil extraction contributing over  billion lbs of feedstock annually to the biodiesel renewable diesel feed and industrial markets moving forward greenshift will maintain its mission of developing and commercializing innovative clean technologies that increase the revenue and profitability of its licensees taking advantage of untapped resources and improved process efficiencies menu mission

resources careers contact biodiesel colocated biodiesel production at ethanol facilities the concept of colocating biodiesel at ethanol plants has been a natural evolution of corn ethanol facilities that extract corn oil today as biodiesel production requirements are becoming more stabilized integrating biodiesel at an ethanol facility can be a highly effective means to improve profits associated with corn oil extraction greenshift offers its services to assist in facilitating the integration of such facilities greenshift is available to provide oversight of a particular project or provide turnkey biodiesel installations while the biodiesel industry gains strength and has demonstrated consistent profitability one can further improve margins through the integration of onsite biodiesel production below are a few of the advantages of to those that integrate biodiesel production no incoming freight oil produced onsite will only require minimal amount of energy to pump the oil to the colocated biodiesel facility generally speaking about the same amount of energy otherwise required to fill an outbound corn oil truck should additional volumes of corn oil be purchased from nearby ethanol facilities there would however be incoming freight costs however there could be freight advantageous as one may be closer in proximity than other potential buyers reduced outgoing freight large scale biodiesel production facilities generally have to ship biodiesel greater distances as local communities cannot consume their full production volumes smaller colocated production facilities however generally have greater opportunities to sell a higher percentage of their production locally and can have reduced outgoing freight costs on a volumetric basis a significant amount of corn oil biodiesel can be sold back the local farming community who farms and transports its corn to the facility on a regular basis infrastructure is already in place to support renewable fuel production and distribution facilities management sales and accounting staff are already in place and can effectively manage the additional fuel produced rail and trucking infrastructure also exists thus minimizing the capital requirements of the project technology advances allow for improved conversion rates and efficiencies over much of the infrastructure in place greenshift welcomes the opportunity to assist

can affect numerous types of crops it puts an oily coating on the leaf then the fungus doesn’t get the chemical signals it needs to find its way into the plant it’s pretty simple but it’s pretty effective  medicinal marijuana farmers prefer using corn oil as a pesticide due to its safety they grow indoors so the humidity is very bad they don’t ventilate a lot so you got the powdery mildew fungus growing in there and they usually get insect problems usually with aphids they don’t want to spray indoors with a bunch of toxic stuff so they always use the organics currently california is

invest in ovation products sponsored by mount arlington nj aug   prnewswirefirstcall  greenshift corp has executed agreements to invest in ovation products corp a development stage company with patented and proprietary technologies involving new implementations of vapor compression distillation ovation has invested over  million developing technology that offers dramatic price and performance advantages over competing clean water technologies ovation is finalizing the development of its initial product the clean water appliance  a firehydrant sized appliance that can generate  gallons of pure water per hour from a variety of dirty water input sources at a cost of about  per gallon or about  of the cost of traditional home distillation methods ovation expects that its clean water appliance will be available in the fourth quarter  and will sell for a fraction of the price of commercial distillation systems to achieve this small size low cost efficiency ovations products incorporate new implementations of a distillation process called vapor compression it has been granted  patents for its technology and system and has filed for an additional five patents to datenative advertisement vapor compression distillationdistillation is the gold standard for water purification in that it removes bacteria viruses heavy metals suspended solids and almost all chemicals it is the single most effective method for purifying water other processes such as ultra filtration and reverse osmosis do not produce perfect water quality discharge several times more wastewater degrade over time and require replacement of filters and cartridges ovations products provide a consistent high quality output and require no filter or cartridges most distillation methods lose a lot of energy in the form of heat said bill zebuhr ovations chairman founder chief technology officer and the inventor of ovations technology it takes  btus to vaporize a pound of water which is equal to about a pint purifying water accordingly costs about  per gallon with a conventional home distiller vapor compression distillation enables the iterative recovery and reuse of the heat of vaporization to evaporate successive batches of water while dirty concentrate is continuously discharged from the system zebuhr has refined the efficiency of ovations technology to the point where ovation has been able to reduce energy loss by over  and distill water for about  of the cost of traditional home methods ovation believes that the ovation clean water appliance is the most efficient commercial distiller in the world of any size the water purification and treatment industrydue to the decline in water quality or access to potable water several million people die every year from water contaminated by solvents pesticides industrial wastes lead and other pollutants the world health organization estimates that globally nearly  billion people are without potable water or basic sanitation and quantifies the costs associated with this problem at about  billion by  while most of these deaths occur in developing countries some also occur in industrialized countries within the united states much of the population lives in metropolitan areas with established water and wastewater systems in place however many of these existing older water and wastewater systems are in desperate need of repair industry consultants estimate that between  and  of water transported via the existing water systems is lost through leakage and inaccurate metering also more individuals are moving to less developed areas with the most rapid population growth occurring in resourceconstrained areas with underdeveloped and inadequate infrastructure compounding this strain is that many of the regions experiencing the rapid growth also have significant water scarcity issues additionally various industries use significant amounts of water in the fabrication of products and the cooling and washing of equipment for example in the semiconductor industry about  to  gallons of water are required to make a single eightinch wafer these highwater demand industries are looking to cut costs by maintaining clean water in the process loop via water treatment systems that discharge a minimum amount of effluent the overall result of the increasingly limited supply of drinking water economic expansion the increasing need for large quantities of purified water by commercial and industrial companies heightened public health and safety concerns relating to drinking water and the promulgation of stringent complex and costly governmental regulations is an increased demand on the water purification and treatment industry to develop efficient costeffective watertreatment systems for various sectors of society these sectors include the household consumer bottled water commercial and industrial municipal and waste treatment markets among others a new business modelovation does not currently anticipate selling standalone products to the public or as a standalone appliance instead ovation anticipates working with key strategic partners in a number of industries that will integrate ovations distillation technology into a variety of appliances products and services ovation will design market and manufacture different component distillers which utilize its core distillation technology and are built to meet specifications requested by its corporate partners because of ovations unique technology and strong patent position it has been and expects to be able to negotiate favorable licensing terms with its corporate partners for specific applications additionally ovation plans to subcontract manufacturing of its clean water appliance and parts to one or more specialty metal manufacturers we have successfully developed our technology to the point where it is costeffective at the residential scale said bob macdonald ovations chief executive officer we believe that this is a tremendous achievement that can have profound implications on how we use our water resources today the philosophy underlying ovations technology is perfectly aligned with greenshifts focus today said kevin kreisler chairman and chief executive officer of greenshift we believe that we can enable substantial environmental gains by developing and supporting practical solutions that make it easy and costeffective for residential and commercial consumers to reduce waste and increase recycling and reuse it is our view that these solutions must profitably and seamlessly integrate with our daily lives and existing infrastructure in order to gain acceptance and bring to pass compelling environmental gains ovations technology achieves this and i am personally thrilled to include this important company in our portfolio said kreisler under the terms of its agreement with ovation greenshift will purchase  shares or about  of ovations outstanding stock for  million and greenshift has the option to acquire an additional  shares of ovation common stock at  per share ovation recently filed to become publicly traded and expects to commence trading later this year greenshift corp wwwgreenshiftcom is a publicly traded business development company bdc whose mission is to develop and support companies and technologies that facilitate the efficient use of

proprietary tornado generator technology is being evaluated for efficacy in processing food products by a domestic based multinational food products company greenshifts tornado generator accelerates compressed air to supersonic speeds in a closed cyclonic chamber where the air is powerful enough to almost instantly grind flash desiccate and atomize solid and liquid wastes and other materials into micron sized powders greenshifts proprietary tornado generator is a completely contained system with no internal moving parts that is powered by compressed air it can safely costeffectively and rapidly process a very broad array of wastes including agricultural wastes septic wastes municipal solid wastes industrial wastes mining wastes and construction and demolition wastes while waste materials are a clear application for this technology we believe that the tornado generatortm also facilitates the more efficient use natural resources upstream directly in production processes said kevin kreisler greenshifts chairman and chief executive officer we believe that most industrial processes that involve some form of grinding pulverizing mixing andor drying can be improved upon with implementations of this technology agriproducts in particular represents a compelling area for improvement in this regard and can be a relatively rapid path to cash flows we are very excited to have the opportunity to work with established market leaders as we evaluate a number of these applications today the earlystage prototypes of one of the technologies used in certain applications of greenshifts tornado generator were initially developed to grind wheat and to improve the processing of poultry wastes video demonstrations of both such applications are available on greenshifts
