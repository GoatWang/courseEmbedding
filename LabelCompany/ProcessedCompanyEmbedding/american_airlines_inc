became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of american eagle airlines propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets a boeing  in the astrojet livery in the late s american commissioned designer massimo vignelli to develop a new livery the original design called for a red white and blue stripe on the fuselage and a simple aa logo without an eagle on the tail instead vignelli created a highly stylized eagle which remained the companys logo until  in  american painted a new boeing  nan in its  international orange livery one boeing  and one boeing  were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail in support of

 american unveiled a new livery before then american had been the only major us airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted this was because c r smith hated painted aircraft and refused

airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet the airline calls the new livery and branding a clean and modern update the current design features an abstract american flag on the tail along with a silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us airways and other affiliates were able to vote american ultimately decided to keep the new look parker announced that american would keep a us airways heritage aircraft in the fleet with plans to add

silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us

became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of american eagle airlines propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets a boeing  in the astrojet livery in the late s american commissioned designer massimo vignelli to develop a new livery the original design called for a red white and blue stripe on the fuselage and a simple aa logo without an eagle on the tail instead vignelli created a highly stylized eagle which remained the companys logo until  in  american painted a new boeing  nan in its  international orange livery one boeing  and one boeing  were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail in support of

airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet the airline calls the new livery and branding a clean and modern update the current design features an abstract american flag on the tail along with a silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us

replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets a boeing  in the astrojet livery in the late s american commissioned designer massimo vignelli to develop a new livery the original design called for a red white and blue stripe on the fuselage and a simple aa logo without an eagle on the tail instead vignelli created a highly stylized eagle which remained the companys logo until

silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us

became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of american eagle airlines propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets a boeing  in the astrojet livery in the late s american commissioned designer massimo vignelli to develop a new livery the original design called for a red white and blue stripe on the fuselage and a simple aa logo without an eagle on the tail instead vignelli created a highly stylized eagle which remained the companys logo until

silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us

became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of american eagle airlines propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets a boeing  in the astrojet livery in the late s american commissioned designer massimo vignelli to develop a new livery the original design called for a red white and blue stripe on the fuselage and a simple aa logo without an eagle on the tail instead vignelli created a highly stylized eagle which remained the companys logo until  in  american painted a new boeing  nan in its  international orange livery one boeing  and one boeing  were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail in support of

silverpainted fuselage as a throwback to the old livery the new design was painted by leading edge aviation services in california doug parker the incoming ceo indicated that the new livery could be shortlived stating that maybe we need to do something slightly different than that  the only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle which kind of makes it confusing so that gives us an opportunity actually to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint in the end american let its employees decide the new liverys fate on an internal website for employees american posted two options one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery all of the american airlines group employees including us
