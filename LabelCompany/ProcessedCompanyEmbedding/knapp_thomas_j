biopharma inc interim gc thomas j knapps views on working with outside counsel in a challenging environment news february   galena biopharma inc interim gc thomas j knapps views on working with outside counsel in a challenging environment request a trial from corporate on bloomberg law stay current on changes and developments in corporate law with a wide variety of resources and tools as part of a series of interviews with inhouse counsel thomas j knapp interim general counsel of galena biopharma inc recently spoke with bloomberg bnas michael greene on what it is like for a small company in the competitive and highly regulated biopharmaceutical industry to work with outside counsel knapp also discusses why he believes the law firm model of billable hours isnt ideal for the provision of legal services and why it may be up to inhouse counsel to drive change in that area bloomberg bna could you talk a little bit about how you became interim general counsel at galena biopharma thomas knapp i had been general counsel of a small publicly traded pharmaceutical company in maryland and after a management turnover was looking for another opportunity i was introduced to the chief executive officer of galena biopharma at a pharmaceutical conference in chicago and learned about the company its history and its current needs galena was attractive because it had a number of issues that needed to be resolved quickly the company is also working on a very exciting trial to address a very serious unmet medical need—a vaccine to prevent the reoccurrence of breast cancer my mother died after a recurrence of breast cancer so the opportunity to be part of a team working to prevent this disease was very appealing to me after a series of conversations with the ceo and board members we firmed up a deal bbna was being an inhouse counsel always something in your plans knapp not always i have had a varied career in that i have gone inhouse outside inhouse outside and now back inside ive been in several industries and with a governmental agency if an opportunity interested me and looked good i jumped bbna how does the work of being an inhouse counsel differ from representing companies while working at an external firm knapp it is quite a bit different in that you have to make sure that your team of people is fulfilling all of their duties accurately and appropriately and in the best interests of the company and its shareholders you obviously feel a strong sense of teamwork with all the other employees to accomplish corporate objectives and follow the mission of the company in a law firm you are doing whats best for your clients but you also have to keep the interests of the law firm and of yourself in your sights in addition even though youre in the trenches with clients and get to know them very well you still go back to another office and clients can change throughout the day the week the month or the year bbna could you address the distinct challenges and perhaps advantages you may have in each position knapp when youre inhouse you have one client—the company you learn the people politics and business of the company from the inside out and are able to take actions to help make the company successful it is an advantage to work with a team towards the success of one organization of course depending on the organization it can also be challenging to work within a corporate structure in a law firm the disadvantage is that youre never really part of a team youre pretty much developing yourself and trying to maximize your business so you dont really have that sense of teamwork or the concept of working towards a certain common goal bbna as a general matter what types of things attract you in looking for potential outside counsel knapp their ability experience and expertise are what i look for an outside counsels understanding of the companys business is incredibly important to me—its the key to outside counsel success in representing any company its crucially important that they know and have directly relevant experience so they can hit the ground running and make real contributions right out of the gate bbna what kind of things alert you that a law firm knows your business as opposed to one that doesnt knapp actually it is easy to tell and becomes evident fairly quickly sometimes even one conference call will tell the tale after we explain a situation all you have to do is listen to responses and questions if someone knows the business their responses and questions will be on point and so will their suggestions for possible actions bbna are there any factors that may turn you away from a particular law firm knapp lack of knowledge about the industry attitude and perhaps an unwillingness to work on efficiencies and pricing also if approaches are suggested that arent in keeping with the direction of the company that firm might not be a good fit with the organization culturally or otherwise that happens sometimes there are always several approaches to every issue and not everyone fits into the culture of every organization so as you would with any outside consultant youre looking to find the right fit the attorney also has to be willing to partner with you to work with you on pricing and to show he or she can manage the people from the firm who are going to work for and with your company bbna can pricing be an instant disqualifier knapp it would be a disqualifier if a firm was unwilling to negotiate in my view all firms should be willing to negotiate the price bbna as a general matter is there any type of work that you believe is better suited to external counsel does being in a small company impact what needs to be done with external counsel knapp most smaller organizations handle the bulk of their litigation externally you wouldnt be able to handle all litigation inhouse because you simply dont have the people your big ma deals probably also are going to be outsourced on the other hand regulatory and compliance issues and contractual matters can be handled internally in fact if you have a good contract administration group you are going to be doing probably  to  percent of your contracts inhouse and thats probably a good thing because it allows the legal department to learn the companys business as well as gain an appreciation of other functional groups in the organization for intellectual property you may go outside unless youre big enough to have your own ip team and the list goes on bbna what type of ratio does galena biopharma maintain between inhouse and external counsel knapp  like other small companies galena has a single inhouse counsel i probably provide about  percent or less of the legal services for the company because the gc role has really evolved into both a legal and a business adviser role so i spend a fair amount of time on business issues bbna how many law firms are you currently working with and do you see that continuing into the future knapp were using three outside firms and thats unlikely to change in the immediate future looking ahead if the company is successful with its trial and grows that would be an opportunity to bring in inhouse people to deal with the additional legal services that come with growth bbna what would tip the scales if anything to using more outside firms knapp time there is never enough of that commodity things always come up—a crisis here or an important matter there that requires immediate attention that means more work for outside firms bbna what keeps you up at night the biopharma industry is under intense regulatory scrutiny how does this impact your work knapp it does impact your work a lot youre always concerned that you are doing the right thing giving the correct advice making sure the is are dotted and the ts are crossed and there are a lot of those being swept into a government investigation is always a concern youre also always concerned that everyone in the company knows what the right thing is and is doing it there are a lot of moving parts to keep track of making sure the company is on the right track and successful and keeping abreast and ahead of changes in the regulatory environment certainly are things that take up a fair amount of my attention bbna has anything changed within the last year that makes it more difficult to do your job knapp youre always going to be on the lookout to ensure that the company is in accord with the regulatory environment that environment as well as the case law for the environment is constantly evolving so you need to be on top of that i would say thats the part of the business that changes from year to year bbna are there other issues youve encountered in your experience that you think may interest other corporate counsel knapp im a member of a group of inhouse counsel that is working towards changing the compensation model for external counsel one of the suggested approaches is compensating outside counsel by project instead of by hours obviously the model needs to be tweaked to be fair to everyone but it is food for thought bbna what if anything can be done to change this model knapp more inhouse counsel need to negotiate this model with their outside firms they can experiment on small projects first to see how the arrangement works for both parties there is room for change and inhouse counsel must be the drivers of that change thomas j knapp  thomas knapp has over  years of corporate and large legal firm experience with regulated industries prior to joining galena biopharma inc a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company as interim general counsel and corporate secretary knapp was executive vice president chief legal officer

which took knapp who lived in elk river and his benelli shotgun throughout europe and to annual appearances at game fair in anoka county as well as numerous tv appearances but his death surprised many “it was kind of a major shocker” said his wife colleen “he became ill about three years ago but miracles happen and he recovered then it came back with a vengeance” knapp’s skills — he could shoot a bullet through the eye of a washer tossed in the air — set audiences’ mouths agape but weren’t superhuman at least not without the showman to reel them in “tom had a specialty he had the gift of gab” said chuck delaney owner of game fair “he always had stories to tell some you never knew if they were true or not but they were interesting it takes a special person to do what he did and he was a special guy” delaney came to know knapp who grew up in maple plain in the early s when delaney ran the st anthony gun club and knapp shot in leagues “he loved the showman side of shooting” delaney said “this was long before he was famous and he was always inventing all kinds of longthrowing trap things there’s no trickery in trick shooting it’s a huge amount of practice and a lot of skill” when

their bb guns he told the pioneer press in  it grew from there when knapp finally hit a clod he was inspired to take the trick as far as he could his theory was this “if you can do it once you know it’s possible so you should be able to do it every time” he told the paper in  he was inducted into the shooters hall of fame at the buffalo bill historical center in cody wyo colleen knapp said her husband of  years did throttle back when home between exhibitions “he had his mellow times when he just wanted to sit in his boat quietly fishing” she said “our property up north that was his getaway place to veg and do nothing well he’d work on the food plots or groom the walking trails but to him that was vegging” according to his wishes no funeral will be held at  pm may  friends and family are invited to gather at the deltoneluth gun club in st cloud for what colleen knapp said will consist of “probably massive storytelling” knapp is survived by brother john two stepchildren four grandchildren and many nieces and nephews colleen knapp said donations can be made to the pulmonary fibrosis foundation at pulmonaryfibrosisorg dave orrick can be reached at  follow him at
