sachs employees try to explain why they used the phrase the street in marketing documents courtney comstock apr    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print david lehman a funny thing happened when goldman sachs employees had to explain what they meant when they put the slang phrase the street on marketing documents when they submitted their testimonies to the financial crisis subcommittee on what caused the financial crisis goldman employees had to explain yet again why the wording in some of the documents goldman used to market products didnt clearly say we might have selected the assets in this product based on the likelihood that they are crap  of course asking the traders these questions is barking up the wrong tree if lawyers dont write the disclaimers in question they check it over  times with a fine tooth comb to make sure the language wont land them in a losing lawsuit but in one case the committee was questioning traders anyway and it asked them what most people understand the phrase the street to mean the phrase sourced from the street appears on the marketing documents for hudson a  billion cdo that goldman sachs selected the underlying assets in it has now emerged that the phrase was meant to be general but had it been  accurate it would have said sourced from goldmans inventory of crap they dont want so the investors who bought hudson now claim that goldman didnt properly disclose to them that they were shorting it and in order to judge the validity of this claim and others like it the committee spoke to a few traders asked what they thought the phrase sourced from the street meant the traders who dont work for goldman had the same answer andrew davilman a former goldman salesperson who sold hudson  securities to investors says he thought it meant assets being acquired from a variety of different brokerdealers at the best prices  morgan stanley which bought hudson thought it meant assets acquired from a variety of different brokerdealers the goldman traders on the other hand all had different answers  darryl herrick who drafted the marketing booklet says it meant the assets were “sourced from a street dealer at street prices” peter ostrem a cdo managing director stated that “sourced from the street” referred to the fact the underlying rmbs securities were not originated or underwritten by goldman deeb salem a goldman mortgage trader who selected  of the assets in hudson  described “the street” as simply “short hand for all brokerdealers” the best answer comes from these two goldman employees david lehman and matthew bieber claimed that it was accurate to say the hudson assets were “sourced from the street” even though all the assets were acquired from the goldman abs desk because goldman was part of “the street” its a funny explanation to say that sourced by the street is an accurate way of saying sourced by us but heres why its genius goldman was the only party short the  billion cdo so getting rid of the cdo was its main objective   goldman sachs lawyers dont get enough credit for designing the wording in some of these cdo marketing documents they made the legal disclaimer work in their favor so it might have sounded like goldman was also an investor in hudson and only bought insurance against its default as a hedge that would benefit every investor when really the opposite was true maybe those objecting should point less blame at goldmans traders who get too much crap for their role in the financial crisis and levy more accusations at goldmans lawyers get the latest goldman sachs stock price here

questions about the markets and the economy and theres no shortage of questions to be answered right now when will the federal reserve raise interest rates how is the strong dollar affecting my portfolio what is going on with china and its currency why are we still talking about greece one surprising question that clients have asked recently is the prospect for a us recession in  goldman sachs david kostin wrote in a new research note an economic contraction is decidedly not in our forecast if anything its surprising that more people arent asking this question sure jobs are growing sales are up consumer sentiment is elevated home prices are rising and stocks are near record levels but good things dont last forever and there are plenty of ominous signs out there that suggest things could take a turn for the worst investors point to the  collapse in brent during the past six weeks the weak macro data from china and the spillover effect on global demand growth lingering uncertainty in europe and the bp compression in year us treasury yields during the last  days to  as reasons for concern about a us downturn kostin continued our response is that while the current us expansion is long in temporal terms  years the magnitude of the recovery is weak and on that basis the expansion phase is closer to earlymidcycle kostin said tersely the chart above from the minneapolis fed illustrates this goldman sachs house view is that growth in gross domestic product accelerates to  in  from  in  then cools to  in  this isnt the first time weve heard that recoveries dont die of old age perhaps the most popular leading indicator of recessions is the inverted yield curve which is when longterm interest rates are lower than shortterm interest rates but as you can see below in the chart taking the difference between the year yield longterm and the twoyear yield shortterm rates have a long way to go before the yield curve inverts that blue line usually goes

smarter adds video filters and more david sacks is back up in the startup game the founder of yammer who sold his company to microsoft for  billion about twoandahalf years ago has decided he’s had enough time off and is joining fastgrowing cloud hr startup zenefits as its new coo sacks has been a valley mainstay for the last  years he joined paypal as its first coo in  leaving his management consultant job at mckinsey to become a member of the paypal mafia in  he founded genealogy website genicom which was sold to myheritage in  but not before the company’s internal communications tool yammer was spun out and we all know how that turned out so if you’re sacks and you sold your last company for more than a billion dollars why do you join zenefits or really go back to work at all “there’s only so much poker i can play” sacks said in a phone interview more seriously sacks says he’s spent the last few years angel investing and even flirted with the idea of becoming a fulltime vc but when push came to shove he realized what he really wanted to do was go back to working on companies and building things the new role at zenefits will pose a unique challenge for sacks unlike his previous startups which he either founded himself or got it at the ground floor zenefits has also scaled pretty substantially over the past few years being a part of that hypergrowth environment is part of what excites him about joining the company “what took yammer three years to do zenefits did in one year… i’ve got experience in product and operations and issues related to hyper growth and there’s a version of that here” sacks said when talking about the hire zenefits cofounder and ceo parker conrad said he sees sacks as a partner in the business and according to conrad all operations finance and product will report up through the new coo that said he also acknowledged that sacks’ background at paypal and yammer will help to manage zenefits through this hypergrowth phase “i expect david will be working on lots of different problems” conrad said “wherever the fires are hottest is where he’ll be focused” while he’s thrilled to have sacks on board conrad said zenefits wasn’t necessarily looking for a coo at the time discussions began the conversation began after conrad spoke with andreessen horowitz general partner and zenefits board member lars dalgaard about the possibility as conrad tells it dalgaard asked if he had considered adding a coo to reduce some of the pressure of running such a fastgrowing company but conrad was pretty opposed to the idea until sacks was mentioned as a possible candidate “i didn’t want a big company bureaucrat” conrad says “but lars asked ‘what if it was david sacks’ and i was like ‘you mean yammer david sacks” an intro was made soon after with conrad and sacks first meeting the week before thanksgiving after spending several days together it was clear they both wanted to be on the same team soon after they reached an agreement whereby sacks would not only join as coo but also made an investment in the company and join the zenefits board sacks isn’t disclosing the size of the investment but did say it was significant “this is the biggest investment i’ve made in a startup and it represents my commitment to the company” he told me the investment shows sacks has some skin in the game but he says it’s secondary to the amount of work he expects to do as a part of the team “i’ve been angel investing in companies for a long time so that part isn’t unique… i just think this company is so exciting and special that i want to spend all my time on it” sacks said  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase zenefits founded  overview zenefits is the leading allinone digital hr platform for small and
