lease evaluation  unit exchange program  landmark infrastructure partners lp the “partnership” landmark dividend’s publiclytraded affiliate has announced the rollout of its unit exchange program uep a product that allows property owners to contribute their infrastructure ground lease to the partnership in exchange for common units in the partnership select features of the unit exchange program are as follows •   units received by property owners under the program would be entitled to receive quarterly distributions announced by the partnership on its common units •   unlike a sale the gains on the contributed ground lease may be taxdeferred because in many cases an exchange of property such as a lease for partnership units does not immediately trigger gain in the property similar in some ways to a  likekind exchange •   ground lease property owners mitigate concentration risk on their infrastructure asset because they would be invested in a publiclytraded partnership currently owning over  leases from wireless carriers outdoor advertising and renewable energy corporations “our unit exchange program offers compelling benefits for ground lease property owners with a cell tower rooftop antenna billboard wind turbine or solar project on their property” said jeff knyal vice chairman of landmark dividend “not only is their rental income replaced with the distributions made by the partnership but the transaction itself may be taxdeferred and offers greater diversification than having an income stream from a single asset” to learn more about the unit exchange program please view the informational uep video below links to download a twopage flyer and faqs about the uep are directly under the video box ground lease landlords can also contact landmark dividend at  for more information the partnership has filed a registration statement including a prospectus with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” for the offering before you invest you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the partnership has filed with the sec for more complete information about the partnership and the uep you may get these documents for free by visiting edgar on the securities and exchange commission website at wwwsecgov alternatively the partnership will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling tollfree  any
