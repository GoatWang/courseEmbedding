a billion business by steve solomon write a comment credit jirka rysavy came to america from eastern europe  years ago with no money no understanding of capitalism little knowledge of english and no idea what to do next today after bringing order and scale to a oncefragmented industry he has a billion business founder jirka rysavy czech immigrant with no business  or even capitalist  background now  market entered corporate officeproducts supply mature fragmented industry with thousands of local suppliers strategy acquire independents and consolidate and professionalize operations result pretax profits of  million on sales of  million in fiscal year  estimated sales of  billion in  largest company in industry   the company was for sale and jirka rysavy was there to buy it but he was not having an easy time it wasnt that the executives sitting around a table at trick  murray early in  were unreasonably demanding about their companys sale after all trick  murray sold office supplies  not the sexiest line of work as merchants of clipboards and paper clips the owners didnt expect to see michael eisner sweep into the boardroom trailed by investment bankers bearing spreadsheets and cellular phones but neither had they expected someone like jirka rysavy pronounced yerka risavee he was tall bearded and as skinny as a scarecrow his mumbled halting english often made him difficult to understand just eight years earlier he had left his native czechoslovakia for the united states following an earlier visit in which he had bummed around the country sleeping in bus stations and on park benches it was hard at first to take him seriously he was not says ted nark then trick  murrays vicepresident of sales a fortune  kind of guy nor did he run a fortune  kind of company at  million in sales rysavys company corporate express was not much bigger than trick  murray itself which had sales of about  million we were pretty skeptical says nark corporate express was by no means a major player in the industry it all seemed a little improbable not for long it didnt where the trick  murray executives saw a marketplace offering only marginal profits rysavy saw a major growth opportunity if staples had grown large by selling office products to consumers and small companies he would grow as quickly by becoming the dominant supplier of office products to larger companies already his merchandising strategy had revived an earlier acquisition in denver he also owned the industrys most powerfully computerized salesandinventorytracking system developed by a czech friend pavel bouska rysavy promised he would grow corporate express to  million in three years he proved to be wrong in fact he had promised too little today three years after acquiring trick  murray corporate express expects sales of more than  billion up from  million with a pretax net of  million last year it is the largest company in its industry chris vroom an analyst with alex brown  sons expects corporate express now a publicly owned company to reach  billion in sales by the year  what rysavy who is  brought to trick  murray were lessons he had taught himself while running a tiny officesupply store in boulder colo  a business not unlike millions of retail operations on main streets throughout america but rysavy never meant to stay small for long he used that operation as a hothouse for testing ideas that could fix problems not only at his own business but also at dozens of other officeproducts suppliers around the country that he planned to acquire one day rysavy sold the same staplers and steno pads as everyone else what was different  very different  was that he figured out a far superior way of doing it   few paths to the kind of success corporate express has achieved are as unlikely as rysavys on september   rysavy went to a downtown prague bus depot to say goodbye to his boyhood chum bouska who was headed to west germany to escape the communist government that had detained him several times as a dissident friends since they enrolled in an experimental mathematics school in prague at age  the two had become increasingly close over the years rysavy himself had been investigated three times by the secret police suspected of dissident activities he and bouska had talked frequently about leaving for freedom in the west now bouska was doing it having managed to secure one of the hardtoget exit visas that the government granted for travel abroad in days bouska would ask for political asylum then sit in a west german refugee camp for six months and finally settle into a softwaredevelopment job in munichunlike his friend rysavy had traveled outside the country as a hurdler in international track and field events in  he used his sports connections to secure an exit visa that enabled him to take a sixmonth trip around the world half that time he spent in the united states although he spoke almost no english he worked small jobs to earn a little cash he lived on  a day i ate bread says rysavy i slept outside in parks or in airports or bus stations by then it was clear that rysavys sneakers took him in directions that few others traveled he welcomed long stretches of time alone practicing meditation in  he lived alone in a shed high in the mountains on the czechpolish border seeing only a few people over the course of nearly a year i ran with the bighorn sheep he says he spent half of each day in meditation and the other half picking berries and other plants and attending to his basic needs to learn to be alone without being lonely is very important rysavy says you realize what youre really about and whats there only as a facade you can rethink all the rules of existence and exercise the choice of taking them as yours or not rysavy left his homeland for good in  after earning a masters degree in engineering i hated the system he says he did not officially defect as had bouska he simply extended his visa and never returned rysavy headed to boulder a college town to the mountains he loved and to a milieu that embraced nonconformists in boulder rysavy first worked in a print shop for  an hour in three months he had saved the  he needed to start a company living in the mountains had given him a strong interest in the environment so he began selling recycled paper his company transformational economy or transecon made  in pretax profits in its first year rysavy invested  in a new enterprise this time to satisfy another of his interests  the strict vegetarian diet he follows in its first year he says his healthfood store reached profitability on  million in sales rysavy had never had formal business training in fact even capitalism was new to him i knew nothing about business he says in czechoslovakia private business was called illegal enrichment to better understand the specific problems he would face as a manager rysavy pored over every relevant book and magazine article he could find it was cornflake university  i learned from business articles i read over breakfast he says i clipped articles i wanted to know what mistakes were made by ceos of growing companies so i read articles to find the relevant answers to get ideas to think about he had planned to open additional healthfood markets but a touch of serendipity changed all that one of his neighbors owned an officesupply store in downtown boulder and wanted to sell it the store was losing money on about  a year in sales but when rysavy took a look at the business the problems seemed not at all difficult to fix he bought the store cheaply paying  and assuming  in overdue accounts payable when he took over rysavy installed a computer system to track customers and sales it was obvious that sidewalk business could not pay the bills but rysavy was intrigued by a handful of successful accounts with local companies that bought office supplies in large quantities to rysavy the future of the operation seemed obvious move away from retail sales and instead focus on the corporate side following that strategy he says he expanded sales nearly eightfold within a year to  million with a pretax margin of  his quick success in one officesupply store made him think could he do the same thing in multiple locations in the fall of  rysavy sought the answer he hired a researcher to collect material on the officesupply industry that december he packed a pile of documents two feet tall and went to maui for two weeks of reading what rysavy discovered in his reading was a huge industry riddled with inefficiencies thousands of officesupply dealers split a market worth more than  billion because almost all the dealers were small  with less than  million in sales  and served local markets they did not enjoy the sales volume they needed to make direct purchases from manufacturers instead dealers purchased most of their items from wholesalers at prices up to  higher than what manufacturers charged in addition with the number of office products exploding in recent years most dealers carried large slowmoving inventories a few savvy merchants  staples and office depot among them  had already grasped the opportunity to bypass wholesalers by  they were just beginning to terrorize local dealers by opening superstores in which they sold office products at discounted prices but superstores served mostly retail customers and small businesses what rysavy saw was an opportunity to do the same thing for midsize and large companiespurchases by corporations with more than  employees accounted for  billion of the annual officesupplies market and by selling directly to those customers instead of operating superstores catering to walkins rysavy was certain he could generate better returns on capital i figured i could cover all of the united states from  warehouses he says office depot would need  superstores he also figured that a big corporate supplier could cover the country with  million to  million in inventory a small fraction of what a network of retail superstores would require while merchants like staples were opening bright new retail stores rysavy decided that it made more sense in the corporate side of the market to buy existing companies rather than start new operations from scratch corporate customers tended to remain loyal to their supplier for a number of years so starting from scratch would require an extended period of building the business  all the while accumulating losses and because many local officesupply companies were doing poorly rysavy figured he could make the acquisitions inexpensively after analyzing the market potential he says i was astounded the opportunity to be first in the market would not last long however rysavy knew it was time to move  and quickly   rysavy found his first acquisition close to home nbi located in a suburb of denver had recorded a loss of about  million on sales of  million when he sold his healthfood market rysavy had only  to invest but this was the roaring s and he managed to leverage the balance of the million price he seemed not at all concerned that he had put almost every dollar of his net worth into a troubled company i came here from czechoslovakia a few years earlier with no money at all he says what would be the worst that could happen id simply go back to having no money again when he took over nbis officeproducts division in  rysavy began implementing the plans he had been devising for the past year he did what had worked so successfully in his small storefront in boulder analyzing nbis customer base to identify the unprofitable orders about one out of every four orders lost money because it was too small to warrant the attendant costs  picking the items from the warehouse packaging them and processing the invoices i cut out all the revenues that lost money rysavy says as he cleared the underbrush that had ensnared nbi work proceeded on what would become the companys most critical competitive weapon in the years ahead an engineer by training rysavy understood better than anyone in the industry the importance of developing a software system that could embrace every aspect of the business but what hotshot programmer would come to a small officesupply company run by a czech ã‰migrã‰ none it appeared except maybe pavel bouska bouska had recently come to america for the first time he had stayed at rysavys acre hideaway nestled  feet high in the rocky mountains above boulder rysavy had showed him the officesupply storefront and shared his plans for the future he had only a few pcs at the time says bouska i was dubious i was running a major softwaredevelopment shop in germany bouska returned to munich determined to stay where he was i had lost my country everything that people consider home he says all of that was gone but i had rebuilt part of it in germany but his thoughts returned again and again in the next few weeks to rysavy and his struggle to build a company in america on a weekend trip to the alps bouska couldnt get his friend out of his mind in  with the communists still in control of czechoslovakia bouska could expect to be arrested if he returned home but a reunion in america with a close friend with whom he had played on the streets of prague it tantalized him that sunday says bouska i called jirka and said im coming   bouskas software system was already in place when rysavy made his pitch to buy trick  murray in  so too was a merchandising plan that enabled rysavys company to bypass the wholesaler middlemen and instead purchase office supplies directly from manufacturers rysavy described to the trick  murray executives a strategy that was producing dramatic results from  million in losses in  the nbi operation was on its way to  operating margins and it was enjoying much greater productivity whereas it once took  employees to produce  million in sales rysavys nbi acquisition by  would employ  people producing sales of  million in addition by  the operations would require half the inventory to support more than three times the salesrysavy completed the acquisition of trick  murray in the summer of  he merged the company into two others he had acquired in the seattle area eight of the nine former principals stayed on to run the combined operation with ted nark taking the top job as president of the companys western region as he had done elsewhere rysavy pruned the seattle operation both to remove withered branches and to expose the main trunk that held everything together we focused says nark on being the best supplier of office products to corporations snipped away were five retail stores as well as some services such as the printing of business cards and letterhead gone too were redundant facilities rysavy also centralized many administrative responsibilities for example accounting functions previously done separately at the three different companies moved to headquarters in the denver area by centralizing functions and eliminating redundant facilities corporate express has improved operating margins by as much as  according to alex browns analyst chris vroom such efficiencies are fairly common in corporate mergers across the broad landscape of american business of course for rysavy however the most significant changes  worth an additional  or so in improved operating margins  went well beyond the standard fare in fact changes in the merchandising plan and in the computer system effected a complete metamorphosis of the seattle operation most officesupply companies including trick  murray before it was merged into corporate express give customers a catalog of  to  items from which to order that requires the supplier to maintain a broad inventory which is costly both because of that inventorys size and because it moves slowly the industry standard turnover is about four to eight times a year because most suppliers are small few of them have the scale to buy much more than half their items directly from manufacturers most of their inventory comes from wholesalers who pass along a hefty markup rysavy brought a far more focused merchandising strategy to the seattle operation what the company calls its instock catalog lists about  items not the traditional  customers can get everything they need but the variety within any category is somewhat circumscribed  perhaps the staplers do not come in emerald green or you cant get them from every manufacturer that makes them if a customer asks for a product that corporate express does not carry the companys computer system automatically suggests a suitable alternative from the instock catalog as a last resort customers can still order from a larger more traditional catalog but the prices for those items typically run higher because the company obtains them from wholesalers about  of corporate expresss sales come from its instock catalog many good things flow from that focused strategy corporate express generates huge sales volumes from just  products enabling it to negotiate bulk purchases directly from the manufacturers according to vroom the company thereby gains about a  cost advantage  even after passing savings on to customers  against competitors who must buy primarily from wholesalers with higher fill rates and lower prices than those of competitors corporate express has grown not just through acquisitions but through doubledigit increases in sales corporate express also gains several big advantages in its inventory with most orders coming from its instock catalog the company is able to deliver about  of all orders by the next business day a percentage thats far higher than the industry norm and a key element in satisfying customers at many companies says rysavy salespeople have to call customers and explain why the order isnt being filled quickly that adds lots to costs and its a frustration for customers rysavys inventory doesnt stick around long high volume on fewer products means faster inventory turnover after it took over trick  murray corporate express increased inventory turns from about  a year to  that produces fireworks on the bottom line with inventory leaving the warehouse in about  days but corporate express paying for it in  the manufacturers finance not only the inventory but also much of the warehouse operations if rysavy created the merchandising strategy it was pavel bouska who brought the computer system to life the system confers on corporate express a major advantage in the marketplace bo cheadle a senior analyst with montgomery securities calls the companys inventorycontrol system the best in the industry why is that so important the items we sell are tiny in dollar value says bouska so we cant spend much money processing an ordercustomers can order office products by traditional means  by phone or by fax  or through an online hookup with the company in every instance a computer checks the items in the order against the inventory in the warehouse if the items are in inventory as they usually are the order goes electronically to the warehouse indicating to employees the location of each item another copy moves electronically to the billing department if any item is not in stock the system automatically checks the online catalogs of two wholesalers choosing the one with the lowest price the wholesaler usually delivers the item to corporate express the same day in terms of sophistication the companys customer purchasing setup pales in comparison with its inventorycontrol system corporate express wants to fill orders from inventory but too big a cushion in the warehouse erodes the bottom line so too does too little inventory which may require the company to fill gaps in customers orders by paying top dollar to local wholesalers every night says bouska the computers look at everything in inventory they try to make sure we dont run out of things  but not at any price we stock only as deep as is costefficient to maintain an optimal level of inventory the computer system analyzes past purchasing patterns and future demand in a fastgrowing market it must factor in a large number of variables including seasonality of orders discounts offered by manufacturers and free freight granted by manufacturers as part of special promotions maybe we should overstock in some cases says bouska because the free freight will more than make up for the overstocking the computer system figures out the answer and then acts on it perhaps ordering  gross of pencils for delivery to the warehouse at exactly the time inventory is projected to reach perilously low levels in a business of pencils and pens  no less than in a business of selling jet aircraft as boeing does in the same city  managing the details well makes all the difference in three years sales for the seattle operation of corporate express have almost doubled and its operating margin has gone from just above breakeven to more than    so confident is rysavy of his ability to improve the margins of the companies he buys that his pace of acquisitions is likely to quicken in the next few years the company expects by the end of  to have acquired at a cost of  million  companies representing revenues of  million the pursuit of acquisitions as a growth strategy poses its own unique challenges of course analysts confirm that none of rysavys acquisitions since  have blown up in his face the company admits that some employees of the target companies resist change and others lose their jobs but rysavy says that the corporate express model is demonstrably so much better than whatever the acquirees were doing that most people go along enthusiastically analysts praise rysavy for recruiting new talent for his management team and for delegating tasks well before he has to even so control over an expanding empire has eluded many entrepreneurs that risk seems heightened in the case of corporate express as it moves overseas and imposes its business model on acquisitions that are out of sight and operating in different business cultures this year rysavy bought a majority stake in the largest officesupply company in australia and he expects to make acquisitions in europe soonthat expansion abroad comes just as competition grows more intense at home corporate express and its four biggest competitors for corporate business  boise cascade office depot buhrmanntetterode and staples  control less than  of the market and all are busy buying small suppliers which is likely to drive up acquisition prices in the future many hundreds of small inefficient players will either fold or sell out over the next five years eventually the big companies like corporate express will begin bumping into one another as they compete for the most lucrative corporate accounts price wars could ensue despite those risks wall street has been eager to finance the companys expansion corporate express made its initial public offering in september  and returned to the markets twice this year to make additional offerings raising more than  million in all rysavy owns about  million shares of the  million outstanding worth roughly  million in early october the financial markets clearly value his companybuilding expertise but the

participating in today’s conference call to discuss gaia’s inc financial results for the first quarter ended march   joining us today are gaia’s ceo jirka rysavy and cfo paul tarell following some prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions before we get started however i would like to take a minute to read the safe harbor language the following constitutes the safe harbor statement of the private securities litigation reform act of  except for historic information the matters discussed today are forwardlooking statements and involve numerous assumptions as well as risks and uncertainties including but not limited to general business conditions integration of acquisitions timely development of new business impact of competition and other risks and uncertainties detailed from timetotime in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including the company’s reports on form k and form q gaia assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements with that i would now like to turn the call over to gaia’s ceo jirka rysavy please go ahead jirka rysavy thank you bethany and good afternoon everyone our first quarter results including the subscriber count ended again ahead of our expectation and guidance paid subscribers grew  to  from  at the end of the first quarter  the growth rate increased sequentially again  up from  end of the fourth quarter and  during the third quarter the revenue in the first quarter increased  to  million from  million in the same quarter a year ago gross margin increased  basis points to  from  we aim to maintain our investment discipline and kept our loss again below plan even with the faster subscriber growth our relaunched site increased pitch low speed and personalized experience for each subscriber as well as increased leverage of the search engine optimization resulted in improvement in our conversion rate which is driving some of our overall performance loss for the quarter was  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter now paul tarell will speak more for the first two – first quarter results paul paul tarell thanks jirca jumping right into our q results streaming revenues in the first quarter increased  to  million compared to the year ago quarter due to the  growth in paid subscribers jirca mentioned gross profit in the first quarter increased  to  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter gross margin increased  basis points to  from  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to leverage gain on our streaming cost due to the higher volumes and our investment in owned and produced content total operating expenses in the first quarter increased to  million which was slightly better than our expectations and are comparable to  million in the year ago quarter the increase was due to the planned increase in selling and operating expenses associated with the announced acceleration of subscriber growth throughout  i’d like to remind our listeners that we like ph to expense subscriber acquisition cost in the period incurred and despite the significant life time value do not record any value of our subscribers on the balance sheet net loss in the first quarter was  million or  per share compared to a loss of  million or  per share in the year ago quarter our net loss for the first quarter of  included approximately  million losses related to the operations of the disposed gaiam brand business segment the per share amounts reflect the repurchase of approximately  of our outstanding shares in july of  during the quarter we’ve had approximately  million of accrued payables remaining from the sale of the gaiam consumer product business and on march  we had  million in cash no debt and unencumbered ownership of its acre  square foot campus with that i would now like to turn the call back over to jirka after which we’ll open the call up for questions jirka jirka rysavy now during the quarter we have expanded our subscriber reach to several new territories bringing our current count to  plus countries we also grew our current us library to approximately  titles about  of all the views from gaia were gain generated by the content produced or owned by us at the end of the quarter we also launched gaia on all comcast xfinity platforms as announced we also expect our subscriber growth rate to keep accelerating after higher than expected jumps we expect subscriber growth keep increasing to about  in the second quarter the second quarter for us is the same as for example netflix is slow as the seasonal quarter the gross rate of  would bring the paying subscriber count at the end of the second quarter to about  up from  at the end of the second quarter  in may of last year based over the market value of our share float gaia was added to russel  and  indexes after that in july of last year we have repurchased about  of our float in a stock buyback our shares price increased since then above  so we expect that our current market cap will not be enough to maintain our inclusion and the rest of the indexes for the coming year and that during the rebalancing occurring these months and some of which you kind of start to experience in the last few days about  of our float which is currently held by index funds will be available for sale we intend for subscriber growth rate to keep accelerating by about  to  per quarter to end up this  for  the subscriber count during the first quarter grew sequentially  to  from  at the beginning of the quarter which is already well above the  annualized growth rate target as to  subscriber gross rate in the quarter exceeded again our target and guidance and our cost of acquiring these customers continues to track at or below our plan we believe that these results supports our subscriber growth expectation for remainder of the year and with that i’d like to open it for the question operator bethany questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions and we will take our first question from mark argento of lake street capital markets mark argento hey jirk hey paul nice quarter just wanted to maybe drill down a little bit looks like you’re doing a decent job on the acquisition side beating our number in terms of total sub adds in the quarter you talk a little bit about the channels in which you’re requiring the subscribers and then some of the – i know you don’t breakout specific subscriber acquisition costs maybe you could just talk about general trends and where they are obviously it looks like you’ve been able to acquire and fairly costeffectively paul tarell so we right now really focusing on our – what do we call seekers for kind of this time of the year however in january which is part of a first sku was primarily yoga because its kind of new me so its for this quarter was about mixed those are pretty much we dont really go after transformation almost at all since the channel is relatively new and we still dont have enough data so pretty much there was kind of mixed in the first quarter jirka rysavy in terms of the cpa trend as you know we dont disclose those for competitive purposes but they’ve been continuing to trend in line with the numbers that we’re targeting and actually part of their overperformance in ads is because – underspend is because we’re able to get them less than we are budgeting we’re just continuing to tweak and refine our growth audiences as we go out and expand and we’re just not hitting an upper threshold of growth as we thought we might which is good for us for the rest of the year it was actually interesting that since this was probably obviously our fastest grow in the quarter as we keep accelerating so far the numbers as we’re getting in march to cpa actually get quite below what we expected to pay which we’re really pleased to see which kind of supports the idea of the big size of the market so it was pretty important to us and we were happy about it mark argento thanks guys so the combination i would assume of page search and facebook and any mixed changes there or has it been fairly consistent paul tarell i would say it’s been fairly consistent overall what we’re doing now that was since we’ve been accelerating and we have several months we’re just continuing to tweak and refine the mix of what we’re doing and how we’re doing it so i’d tell you same overall channels and mix its just much better insight into the customers that stick around versus just the customers that are easy to get but maybe dont retain jirka rysavy also as i mentioned when we relaunched the site end of the last year the conversion rates with personalized offering all these other features kind of helping us to overachieve to what we thought would be our target mark argento got it all right and then in terms of the content costs obviously you guys are going to be spending spending a little more any thoughts around to kind of where you see content costs shaken out for the year paul tarell well it’s kind of changing pretty much by the quarter as number of subscribers changing but you know the numbers of the cost per hour production its probably came from   two years ago to you know probably right now its running between  and  which is still kind of quite less than  million of netflix but we’re going to be pretty discipline on that stuff the license content is probably it’s quite cheaper than produced content mark argento great and i hop back in the queue thanks operator operator instructions and we will take our next question from zacary sherman of foxhill capital zacary sherman hi guys congratulations on a great quarter i think in the previous quarters you did break out what your subscriber acquisition costs were i may have missed it if you said that previously could you give that for this quarter paul tarell yes zacary this is paul it is a required annual disclosure on our gaap which is why we’ve done it in q it’s not something that we plan on providing quarterly updates on but for this quarter i will give you the breakout here just because you’ve asked so it is about  million in terms of the spend for q in customer acquisition zacary sherman great that’s very helpful paul tarell and just a little bit of context there some of that spend was related to what we were doing with the gaia on xfinity platform launch so it may not all be directly correlated to the direct business zacary sherman great that’s all i got thanks a lot operator and at this time this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to mr rysavy for closing remarks jirka rysavy well thank you and thanks everyone for joining and we look forward to speak with you when we report our second quarter which will be in early august thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s teleconference you may disconnect you lines at this

afternoon everyone during the third quarter we completed the sale of our branded consumer product business and recognized  million pretax gain in addition to the second quarter  million sale of our  interest in natural habitat which we acquired for a  million other gains were offset by our nol we have used the majority of the proceeds from the disposition to conduct a share purchase tender offer and acquired  shares of our shock at  vested stock options at  per share the remaining proceeds will be used to fund the continuing growth and development of our business as well as general corporate purposes our third quarter results including the subscriber count and its slightly ahead of our expectation and guidance this paid subscribers growing  to  from  at the end of q of  gross margin improved higher  basis points to  from  in the q of  net loss from continuing operation for the third quarter was  or  per share compared to a loss of  or  per share in a year ago now will let paul tarell our cfo to speak more about third quarter paul tarell thanks jirka the reported results we issued in todays press release are from continuing operations excluding the results of the gaiam branded business which we sold on july st and our interest in natural habitat which we sold on may th the assets liabilities in the financial results from these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented now moving on to our q results streaming revenue in the third quarter increased  to  million compared to the year ago quarter due to continue strong subscriber growth which was slightly offset by the decline in revenues generated from nonstreaming including our legacy dvd subscription club total subscribers at the end of the third quarter grew  to  compared to a  in for the same quarter of  growth profit in the third quarter increased  to  million compared to  million in the yearago quarter gross margin increased a  basis points to  from  in the third quarter last year the increase was primarily due to leverage gained on streaming cost due to higher volumes and higher revenues total expenses in the third quarter increased to  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter this increase was primarily due to spending  million on customer acquisition and branding during the current quarter compared to  million in the year ago quarter the remaining increase was due to higher payroll related expenses due to an increase in headcount to support our realized and projected growth the cost of business separation activities and the cost of transition services which ended on september th loss from operations in the third quarter was  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter driven by primarily by the increased expenses previously mentioned with the conclusion of the sale of the gaiam branded business during the quarter combined with the gain from natural habitat in the second quarter we realize a total gain of a  million we utilized historical net operating loss carry forward to offset a majority of this gain resulting in  million of tax expense related to this divestitures this tax expense was further offset by losses generated from continuing operation which resulted in a tax benefit of  million in the third quarter of  for continuing operations we find to pay approximately  million in remaining cash taxes in december  well make our estimated tax payment for the year net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter was  or  per share compared to a loss of  million or  per share in the year ago quarter income from discontinued operations including the gain on the sale of the gaiam branded business net of taxes and transaction expenses contributed to generating net income of  million or  per share compared to a loss of  million or  spent per share in the third quarter of last year at september th  we had  million in cash we continue to carry no debt which resulted in a current ratio of over  we also own our fully leased  square foot office headquarters in boulder colorado with that i would now like to turn the call back over to jirka for some additional remarks after which well open the call up for questions jirka jirka rysavy yes last week we also launched our new gaiacom site with a new personalization engine and dramatic improvements in our with the delivery the new technology is designed to optimize for algorithms of search engines which currently represent a significant part of our customer physician efforts the new features include our latest the geofencing technology and also flexible to support our multilingual international efforts we also invested in retention technology and several new apps is the new android app already launched a new ios roku and smart tv apps launching later this month we have expanded our subscriber reach to several new countries bringing detouring current count to a  we also meaningfully edit to our content growing our current us library to approximately  titles because of the exclusivity of our content and the niche offering gaias position as complementary service to large entertainment svod players like netflix  of gaias subscribers have now also subscription to netflix  of the views on gaia are generated by content produced by us we recently renew our shelf registration with sec it was set to expire in october we have had this shelf registration in place continually since  while we have no current plans to utilize the shelf to renewals consistent with our history of keeping the filing current and available for use if strategic opportunities arise and i would like to reiterate that we do not have any current plan to use it our recent stock purchase representing about  for our shares outstanding was in addition to previous  years when company was also a net buyer of its stock at end of the quarter we have  million cash on our campus and carry no debt as announced previously we expect our subscriber growth to start accelerating and reaching about  by the end of the year which would be  subscriber growth we have elected to expand the subscriber acquisition costs upfront and do not capitalize the value of our subscribers on balance sheet despite of the significant lifetime value therefore no value of these customers is reflected on our gaap financial statement and because of this all these exciting potentials and opportunities i have return after  years as a ceo and i do truly enjoy the job and with that i like to open the call for questions operator melissa questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions and our first question will come from mark argento with lake street capital markets mark argento hi good afternoon guys jirka rysavy hi mark paul tarell hello mark argento hey just some maybe could just help us think through a little bit how ramp in terms of the customer acquisition spending think you ended the quarter at about a  and then you got a  have you guys started to crank up the customer acquisition spend are you seeing the trends there you like in terms of the customer acquisition costs so you can drive a positive roi on those new subs paul tarell yes i mean even with the increase i mean this third quarter it was a meaningful increase of the spending its doing its going really well but the spending wasn’t really different per customer and as a we go to fourth quarter we expect similar thing we don’t spend more per customer were just spending more overall dollars to acquire more customers and we don’t expand because for acquisition increasing actually what we saw generally over last few months that especially on the kind of transformation in secret side of the business that the cost per acquisition is slightly below what we actually budgeted it mark argento in terms of the overall seasonality i know the i would say kind of fitness wellness is still a decent part of your mix and that historically has favored seasonality some in q but obviously in q you anticipate seeing similar type of seasonality with the subscriber growth jirka rysavy yes i think right now in the fourth quarter its come more from the transformation side as generally come yoga and that wellness for kind of new me im sure will be done many like every i don’t think that will change it will be always generally ahead with already on that and as we go to end of the first quarter i think well kind of reverse back to the transformation side but generally this half of the year is better for us historically than the other parts it should follow kind of netflixs acquisition seasonality its pretty much same as they see mark argento all right and then in terms of the balance sheet and i know the stock have been pretty soft for the last month or so do you have a share buyback authorized at this point i know you obviously get this on a bunch of stock back or kind of a bunch of stock but just given kind of the choppiness with the tape right now would you guys be amenable they take continue to use your balance sheet opportunistically on the buyback jirka rysavy well we talk about several times why this is definitely becomes where it is whats the pricing and stuff we put a buyback on time ago we talked about it we already want to put all the numbers because basically today is the first time we put in actual number of the balance sheet and the tax phase and all that stuff so we would definitely were going to have information up there before we consider the buyback but as we said we just bought  and we previously for last  years were net buyers so i don’t think that finally well change the direction right now we have the lot of cash mark argento okay all right congrats on the sale on the new business model thanks jirka rysavy thank you mark operator thank you well next go to peter rabover with artko capital peter rabover hi guys can you hear me jirka rysavy yes do peter rabover hey got a couple of questions so looks like you guys went  million on customer acquisitions but what was the growth at of the customers jirka rysavy we don’t provide those numbers even on really kind of grow we say numbers netflix get because then you kind of get to how you come with the retention and the  for example the issues like for us if you lose the customers and get them back six months or as a new customer for netflix with the existing customers is a confused issue if you start to talk about net net and gross customers so i think we would say this net add on the cost we got a full pretty much in netflix disclosures paul tarell and peter i just want to clarify my scripted comments we said  million on customer acquisition that is for to make sure you had the right number there peter rabover okay yes sorry i apologize paul tarell okay peter rabover and then on the last quarter you guys entered  is that right paul tarell yes peter rabover okay and then on the balance sheet so it looks like you guys have a little bit more cash its  and on that investments and other  million could you guys clarify what that is paul tarell yes we made some investment in theres a kind of couple mostly its been retention technologies investment and invested a little bit on a private company which were interesting technology for retention we also invested our new apps and as we said we kind of launched some of the apps now and were going to do a little more and so that’s pretty much all of thats up there peter rabover is all the escrow cash been released from the transaction paul tarell yes we received all the escrow cash though it was a small amount of receivables left from the buyer that we received in october but not meaningful amount but all the cash have now been received jirka rysavy it was about  what we received in october and we mentioned the tax is revised well have to pay over next quarter when there wasn’t  pay is about  million peter rabover okay great and just last question can you guys comment what the cash burn was this quarter was that ebit the kind of approximate number on that paul tarell the q will be filed tomorrow that will have that in there peter rabover okay great thanks operator thank you well next go to zacary sherman with foxhill capital partners zacary sherman hi guys jirka rysavy hello zacary sherman i was just wondering if you could break out with the onetime expenses in the quarter were from the business separation in the transition services and what you see going forward in the next couple of quarters if theres anything remaining thanks paul tarell sure ill answer those in a reverse order so the ongoing stuff is de minimis at this point being able to break it out specifically that that harder to do for this quarter because its not as cut and dry as it was in the first half of the year because it was transitioning and separating the businesses but also doing all the setup of the new business going forward as that smaller or new public company so i cant put a specific number on it but i would say its somewhere in that  to  range would probably be a safe number but those are not going to be continuing in into q jirka rysavy and those are kind of what we  the problem with the counting gaap statement there are statements what i allow to put in discontinue line and the head staff would even its related to discontinue operation is not because lets say we have our previous general counsel and cfo which stay on the payroll too like end of this september and they are still staying bonus is some staff and so how you count for it it is all pretty significant all the severance system stuff so why they not kind of one time effective as they will be for us because they will not continue but they will allow them to  they even they don’t allow to be classified a discontinue operation so this is what paul saying so difficult to put actually a number on it it have crossing the gaap statements but i think next quarter the number i think will be pretty clean there is worth so nothing would continue so over this except we still would have but we still have some severance is little bit but they are actually all accrued i think right paul tarell yes jirka rysavy so next quarter should be pretty clean operator thank you operator instructions and well next go to douglas coburn with venture capital jirka rysavy hello operator wait just a moment please douglas coburn can you hear me operator okay mr coburn go ahead douglas coburn thank you hi this is douglas here how are you jirka rysavy good how are you doing good douglas coburn doing good thanks thank you for taking my question here i just have two questions the first is if you could walk me through how you think about deploying cash through prior customers in a profitable way do you have a minimum return threshold jirka rysavy yes of course for us you can think it simple our balance sheet right now is basically cash and our building and so we can call it  million plus our library which we carry a much lower number because we expand whatever with the deal and then we have we basically turn cash into new customers we do not capitalize the customer so thats not on the balance sheet so you have to use your judgement how many hire  customers are they are obviously people like current subscribers they typically kind of well you step about  but its more to market value if you kind of to look last time value true last time values maybe a half of that but we basically the goal for us when we acquire new customer is to spend maximum  of the lifetime value we actually currently spend quite less than that but in average well be always less than a half because some of them we get a  i mean  but we never spend more than  so basically the idea is take  of cash and turn it to  or  customer value so thats pretty much the guidance douglas coburn got it and then i think you haven’t disclosed the average lifetime of the customer but i guess the overall return would vary depending on whether that value is realized in a few years or in the longer term jirka rysavy well i mean it roughly when i said its about half so she would have taken  and take  we do to lifetime value based on our cash contribution margin which is currently about   if we don’t do the calculate it in a revenue so we actually taking true value of the customer and then you go pretty much from the revenue and the average revenue we charge  a month but people buy annual it would be less because the annual people pay about a  so thats how you can pretty much figure out the average there is little more complications because there are some different way if you go through apple of not or if the use are different but in because we would pay up or like  first year and  second year so but they would have additional marketing expenses per se so the calculation is little more difficult but roughly the retention is kind of depends customer segment very small then like x so we would have to talk specific customer segments to make sense but average you can get from the overall guidance or lifetime value douglas coburn got you thank you and along those same lines in terms of how you expect that customer acquisition cost to change over time and potentially increase with more competition if you think i had in five years based on the numbers that you projected when youre above  million subscribers how do you expect competition to manifest where do you think its coming from and how would it impact your acquisition costs jirka rysavy well i mean our  the competition for what were doing its not coming from what you say competitors its definitely competitors for when you bid on certain names or works right but they don’t necessarily come from our competing segment they might be somebody who sell some widgets but so its not really per se our competitor where we see the pressure from but we don’t expect to go over  lifetime value anywhere during the process actually our expectation it is because we see were getting more efficient in buying same as netflix so i think the trend that you tend to actually be better what you do obviously as we kind of grow faster that that additions few might be more people youre paying its toward  than we pay today because today our average in some of the department some of the channels are    of the  but we will see probably getting closer to  as we go as the numbers get bigger but overall saying we got same amount of customers today and then i think we actually be more efficient than we are today douglas coburn right but do you expect another company or somebody to copy basically what youre doing and come up with their media library and start addressing some of those same topics that youre currently selling do you think that is something that will likely happen jirka rysavy look we dont know about anybody today theres nobody in our horizon but i think your guess is as good as ours it should happen or not douglas coburn okay and do you have a certain i guess plan to deal with such competition jirka rysavy it is hard to plan on something before it exists where we know our competition will come from they it can manifest various way but today on our main channel its really question its a channel different like in yoga there is currently  people in the us doing it douglas coburn right jirka rysavy nobody really success or significant but there is lot of people doing it for  years on the what we call truth seekers side then its like much more difficult because when we originally envision it in now four five years to go we outline like  titles make sure are published in the united state or anywhere like in english over a  years and we went aggressively after them with a team and we today are probably  of those titles so for somebody coming to that space would be quite difficult its possible because they can produce the content but produce maybe a half a  titles it takes some time so if its somebody will be pocket will be much cheaper for them to buy us and try to compete on from this get go and if its somebody whos doesnt have enough financial theyre just going to have a hard time douglas coburn got it so you basically in those specific nature you control the market by earning the majority of the relevant content jirka rysavy thats kind of the plan so if we go to the new space we need to kind of dominate a space thats kind of the idea its pretty much exclusive content also the content is for us over  exclusive and its and its increasing because were producing more were getting better the license is about a little long so its very stable business at a way so i don’t think that this would particularly quite sure we will be proud the dealer issue i think we would more worry about somebody from waiting there for some other reason is one of reason we have a guy and we have  of us market share and fitness by  this we kind of finale them effectively was this statistic and its called video scan and in the videos we decided not to be in a fitness so we pretty much took our viewing outside fitness from about  to less than a  and in long term probably we don’t have any fitness because we would see that long term somebody like nike might decide to create a content and give it free to sell the product and we will not be caught in situation like that so for us the position niche is really part of strategy so its very important for us to that these kind of niches we can play significant role or just not be there because we have lot of niches we can go to douglas coburn got it that makes sense and the content that youre currently creating is it mostly for yoga or that youd be costing pretty much across the board jirka rysavy made across the board yoga is not probably from usage on this side yoga is maybe  douglas coburn okay so the content you create might be under areas such as transformation jirka rysavy yes douglas coburn got it thats all thank you very much i appreciate the insight jirka rysavy thank you operator at this time this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back to mr rysavy for closing remarks jirka rysavy thank you melissa and thank you everyone for joining and we look forward to speaking with you when we are at our fourth quarter which will be at the end
