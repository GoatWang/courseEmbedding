fund manager by nic brisbournedecember   questions venture capital  comments   sixth in a series of weekly posts by myself and nicholas lovell of gamesbrief which answer the fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital  we expect the series to run for a year after which we will collate the posts into a book  you can find the rationale behind the series here and the list of questions here  we welcome your comments on any and every aspect of what we are doing ————————————— let me start by explaining two terms in the question  ‘lp’ is a generic term for an investor in a venture capital fund typically they are pension funds or insurance companies otherwise known as ‘institutional investors’ but they can also be corporates wealthy individuals or governments looking to stimulate the startup ecosystem  lp is short for limited partner a reference to the legal status of investors in venture capital funds – technically they are partners in the fund with limited rights and obligations  i covered this in a little more detail when i answered the question where do vcs get their money from a ‘venture capital fund manager’ or sometimes ‘venture capitalist’ is the team of people that decide which companies to invest in and then manage them to exit they are often known as the ‘gp’ or ‘general partner’  a gp can have multiple funds under management at any one time and they are compensated according to the terms of the gp agreement for each fund which determines the fees and profit share they receive  i covered this in a little more detail when i answered the question what is venture capital turning to the question du jour the first thing that an lp looks for in a venture capital fund manager is track record  in venture capital past success is a very good indicator of future success unlike many other asset classes  entrepreneurs like to work with investors who have shown an ability to make money and hence vcs with a good track record stand a better than average chance of getting into the best deals and therefore making more money  additionally vcs who have had good success have typically built strong networks on the back of that success and are more able to help their companies with introductions to customers and partners the next thing an lp will look for is to see that the team has worked together before  ideally they have all worked together in the same manager and developed a good track record together  alternatively if the individuals have worked together in past lives then that might be enough to get the lp comfortable after that the lp will look to the fund structurestrategy – how many investments of what size and in which geographies and sectors the fund manager intends to make  there are some basics that have to be got right – eg the team needs to be large enough to make the planned number of investments when taking into account their commitments to earlier funds the fees need to be sufficient to cover the planned expenses of the manager  some other elements are more subjective and will appeal differently to different lps – eg which sectors the gp intends to invest in cleantech internet etc finally if the lp is comfortable on the three items above they will start to look to the terms of the venture fund of which the most important by far are the fees typically  of funds under management and the profit share or carried interest typically  of profits often after a basic return has been delivered  lps look through these percentages to see how much money the partners in the gp will get and as a result larger funds are usually nearer the bottom of the ranges given whilst smaller funds are able to get nearer the top  more successful funds are able to command higher fees and carry the first three items track record team history strategy are typically go or nogo gating items whereas the terms are more of a negotiation  related articles where do vcs get their money from theequitykickercom is venture capital right for your company theequitykickercom what is venture capital theequitykickercom is inlab’s vc  the cure for what’s ailing the venture capital game dailyfinancecom the right amount of venture capital to raise acquiacom httpwwwgamesbriefcom nicholas lovell the “good vcs get better deals” is an interesting angle when it comes to luck in other words you could say that the secret to being a good vc is to get lucky once because once you have a reputation for being lucky lps and entrepreneurs want to talk to you of course i don’t believe in luck or rather i believe luck happens and lucky people are those who find ways to be open to lucky situations so vcs more than most need to open to the possibility of black swans and be ready to capitalise on that success httpwwwalanodeacom alanodea guys great work so far my one comment about this recent post is simplay to ask is this not a bit high level for a focus on the games industry and a book not all games industry guys get vc that got to be like  of all games companies raise form institutions moreover i think it’s a bit high level to be talking about where vc’s get their money and the value chain of the vc industry it might be more valuable to focus on what sort of funding levels vcs look to invest at and what sort of returns and equity splits their looking at ie more tactical and less strategic vc value chain issues as a games company owner looking for funding i don’t need to know where vc’s money comes from i am much more interested in their measures and criteria from investment httpwwwalanodeacom alanodea hey guys great series and articles so far my comment is about relevance for this post if the series is fifty questions you should ask before raising venture capital it might be more valuable to focus on what sort of questions to ask your potential vc partner ie more tactical advice and less strategic and vc value chain issues as a company owner looking for funding i don’t care where my vc money comes i’ve never had had my board members investors cofounders or managers ask me about what a lp is and how a vc raises its money nor am i going to be sitting down over tea talking to vc partners about their own fund raising struggles strategies and hardships 🙂 i wouldn’t expect my vc to share that information with me or any other company or company owner looking to raise money with them if it is fifty question you should ask before raining venture capital the next questions in the series to my mind are filling in more detail on what a vc is looking for and what does it involve for a company owner when and if they decide to chase and secure vc funding so questions such as • how much do they invest • what are the typical format and criteria for investment • what returns and timeframes do they expect a company to deliver • how will they work with the company ie does investment require board positions special share privileges and voting right • what is the general process of getting vc investment • how long will it take beyond that if you think it’s really important to focus on lp’s and talk about the fact that vc’s manage their own investors funds then a further output of this post might be some questions a company owner should ask when performing diligence on their potential vc investor • has the vc currently got a viable fund under management • can they

fund ii lp  others note   mass app ct  december    march   suffolk county present lenk mills  trainor jj fraud practice civil fraud dismissal the judge in a civil action was justified in concluding that the plaintiffs conduct in manufacturing evidence swearing to its authenticity and continuing to insist on its authenticity for more than seven months while an expert investigated the matter constituted a fraud on the court  moreover the judge in the exercise of inherent powers acted within his discretion in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal of the complaint  civil action commenced in the superior court department on december   a final judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice was entered by allan van gestel j scott p lopez for the plaintiff carl d bernstein of new york joseph f hardcastle with him for the defendants mills j the plaintiff suni munshani munshani appeals from a superior court judgment that dismissed his complaint based on the judges finding that munshani committed a fraud on the court by manufacturing evidence swearing to its authenticity and continuing to insist on its authenticity for more than seven months while an expert investigated the matter a related decision by the same judge ordered munshani to pay the costs and fees of the courts expert and the defendants attorneys page  fees and costs in connection with fraud investigation note  in this appeal munshani essentially concedes that he fabricated evidence and submitted a false affidavit but argues that the sanction of dismissal was inappropriate in the circumstances and that the judges conclusion that munshanis intentional misconduct constituted a fraud on the court was wrong as matter of law we affirm  background on december   munshani commenced this action seeking  million in damages on theories of breach of contract unjust enrichment and breach of g l c a he alleged oral promises made by the individual defendants barton w stuck and michael e weingarten to munshani on which munshani purportedly relied as an inducement to raise capital for stuck and weingarten these individual defendants are in the venture capital business and both are founders shareholders and managing directors of defendant signal lake ii llc their largest single investment was in a company called terago communications inc terago on whose board both individual defendants served in their answer and counterclaim the defendants denied munshanis claim and asserted among other things that munshani had lied to them about his background concerning involvement in litigation and bankruptcy while acknowledging there had been discussions with munshani concerning his potential role and compensation by the defendants the defendants asserted that there was never any agreement between the parties principally because munshani kept changing and increasing his demands among the defendants defenses to munshanis claim for breach of contract was a statute of frauds affirmative defense at the time he initiated the state court proceedings at issue in this appeal munshani also commenced a companion action in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against terago claiming he was entitled to  million shares of terago stock based on the same alleged services that formed the page  basis for his claims in the state court action note  munshani successfully opposed the defendants motion to dismiss the federal complaint based on a statute of frauds defense by submitting an electronic communication email he allegedly received from teragos president the federal judge concluded that the email sufficed at least for purposes of a motion to dismiss to take the case out of the statute of frauds the same email was subsequently submitted in the state court proceedings it is this email which was not in fact written or sent by teragos president that is at the heart of this appeal on february   alleging that the email submitted in the federal case was fraudulent the defendants moved in the state court action for an order seeking the preservation and production for copying all of munshanis computer hard drives and related backup tapes and for expedited discovery munshani opposed the motion while also recognizing the extremely serious nature of the accusations with his opposition and a copy of the email at issue munshani submitted an affidavit as he had also filed in federal court unequivocally stating i did not tamper or alter the email in any way munshani acknowledged that hemant trivedi teragos president and the purported sender of the email in question had prepared an affidavit stating that trivedi had not sent the email at issue and munshani correctly recognized that the record suggests that either munshani or trivedi has submitted a false affidavit munshani thus proposed that a neutral expert be appointed by the superior court judge to investigate the extremely serious allegations on march   the judge accepted munshanis proposal and appointed a neutral expert to investigate the allegations relating to the emails authenticity during the several months of investigation the parties appeared before the same superior court judge on numerous occasions including in connection with munshanis requests to stay discovery until the investigation was completed as well as on various other matters related to the investigation at no point during that time did munshani confess to his fraud to the page  contrary he permitted the investigation to continue and perpetuated the charade on september   the neutral expert submitted a page report in which he concluded that the email was clearly not authentic the judge allowed twentyone days for comment on the report munshani filed no objections but on the very last day of the comment period submitted a written response invoking his privilege against selfincrimination pursuant to the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and art  of the massachusetts declaration of rights munshanis response continued stating that he therefore declines to testify about or respond to the experts report the judge accepted the experts report in its entirety and adopted it as his findings in the matter in his order the judge inferred from munshanis response that his affidavit concerning the email was wholly false and a deliberate and intentional fraud on the court such affidavit had set in motion a number of hearings and a detailed investigation by the courtappointed expert the judge noted that throughout the entire process munshani remained silent and never once came forward to reveal his fraudulent conduct the judge thus dismissed munshanis complaint with prejudice and ordered him to pay the costs and fees of the expert as well as the defendants attorneys fees and costs related to the discovery of munshanis fraud munshani now claims that the dismissal was an abuse of discretion because his conduct involved a collateral discovery issue that was unrelated to the merits of any claim or defense in the state case and that the judges decision was ill considered munshani also asserts that the judges finding that the email and affidavit were material was clearly erroneous as was his finding that munshanis conduct constituted a fraud on the court note  more specifically munshani suggests that his conduct did not amount to a fraud on the court because  it was an isolated instance of perjury rather than an unconscionable scheme  his conduct had absolutely no impact on the trier of fact and  his conduct did not unfairly hamper the presentation of the defendants claims or defenses page   discussion the judge characterized munshanis conduct as intentional fabrication gross abuse of the court and the parties tampering with the fair administration of justice and disrespectful his conclusion that munshani had committed a fraud on the court was based on a definition appearing in rockdale mgmt co v shawmut bank na  mass     citing hazelatlas glass co v hartfordempire co  us    we examine the judges analysis of munshanis conduct as fraud on the court and conclude that the judge was justified in concluding the conduct was fraudulent and was within his discretion in imposing the ultimate sanction of dismissal we also note that the sanction was appropriate in the circumstances even without any necessity of equating munshanis conduct with the technical definition of fraud on the court in brief the judge in the exercise of inherent powers acted within his discretion in ordering dismissal a fraud on the court fraud on the court implies corrupt conduct and embraces only that species of fraud which does or attempts to defile the court itself  winthrop corp v lowenthal  mass app ct     quoting from pina v mcgill dev corp  mass     fraud on the court involves the most egregious misconduct winthrop corp v lowenthal supra and that misconduct may be by parties as well as by their attorneys see macdonald v macdonald  mass    n  the court in rockdale adopted the definition of fraud on the court as detailed by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit in aoude v mobil oil corp  fd   st cir  a fraud on the court occurs where it can be demonstrated clearly and convincingly that a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial systems ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing partys claim or defense rockdale mgmt co v shawmut bank na  mass at  quoting from aoude v mobil oil corp  fd at  the court in rockdale also stated when a fraud on the court is shown through clear and page  convincing evidence to have been committed in an ongoing case the trial judge has the inherent power to take action in response to the fraudulent conduct note  the judge has broad discretion to fashion a judicial response warranted by the fraudulent conduct dismissal of claims or of an entire action may be warranted    as may be the entry of a default judgment we examine judicial responses to findings of fraud on the court for an abuse of discretion rockdale mgmt co v shawmut bank na supra citations omitted note  in the present case the record including the experts comprehensive report convincingly establishes that munshani set in motion an unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the courts ability impartially to adjudicate a matter in accordance with applicable rules the judge properly determined that munshani engaged in the scheme and attempted to deceive two courts munshanis conduct was not limited only to the fabrication of the disputed email or its submission to the court with a false affidavit but included several months of additional charade attempting to hide the fabrication the judge was justified in concluding that munshanis fraud amounted to an unconscionable scheme to deceive the court examination of the complaint the defendants answers including amended counterclaims the relationships between the parties in the federal action and those in the state action and the nature of both state and federal claims involving alleged oral agreements against which the defendants interposed a statute of frauds defense makes clear to us that munshanis conduct as well as the falsified documents were not collateral to the state court proceeding pretrial discovery in our view is not collateral when part of substantial litigation furthermore the defendants assertion that the parties credibility was the centerpiece to this litigation appears justified in the record page  the judge also fairly could conclude that munshanis behavior was calculated to influence the judges determination of requested pretrial discovery orders with the intended result being a hampered presentation of the defendants defenses and counterclaims for example the judge found that munshani fabricated evidence and caused his lawyer to submit the fabricated evidence in successful opposition to a motion to dismiss his companion federal action and to submit to both the federal court and the state court an affidavit attesting to the authenticity of the fabricated email in support of their motion to preserve electronic evidence and expedite discovery the defendants submitted an experts affidavit asserting that the email was fraudulent munshani still admitted nothing but suggested that the judge appoint an independent expert insisting that he had been wrongly and irresponsibly accused of perpetrating a fraud in sum munshani sought to gain tactical advantages against the defendants while simultaneously throwing a large monkey wrench into the judicial machinery aoude v mobil oil corp  fd at  while munshani claims that his conduct had absolutely no impact on the trier of fact the judge made specific note that the conduct set in motion a number of hearings and a detailed investigation by the courts appointed expert and that the court and the defendants were made dupes to his actions and spent countless hours trying to sort out the fraud the judge also found that had munshani succeeded with his fraud he could have dramatically changed the face of the case    to the serious detriment of the defendants and the court as well we hold that the judge properly found that munshani had committed a fraud on the court irrespective of whether his conduct comported in all technical detail with the few available definitions of such fraud although we nevertheless hold that it did the judges memorandum reveals thoughtful consideration of the difficulty of uncovering sophisticated computer fraud and the need to deter future attempts by litigants to avail themselves of what might otherwise be viewed as a lowrisk means of gaining an advantage in high stakes litigation as the trial court judge pointed out all courts are at the mercy of litigants and their advocates page     in the often difficult search for truth the ability to discover fraud in the process particularly sophisticated computer fraud is greatly limited thus the imposition of strong sanctions is one of the very few ways of deterring such activity in the future this court intends such a message here b dismissal as sanction the ultimate sanction of dismissal is not limited to instances of behavior that are technically defined as fraud on the court see enlace mercantil internacional inc v senior indus inc  fd   st cir  delay can constitute extreme misconduct justifying dismissal robson v hallenbeck  fd   st cir  range of circumstances where court has authority to dismiss case is so vast as to defy mechanical rules tower ventures inc v westfield  fd   st cir  dismissal affirmed where zoning applicant repeatedly failed to comply with discovery scheduling order for no good reason courts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested by their very creation with power to impose silence respect and decorum in their presence and submission to their lawful mandates anderson v dunn  us  wheat    these powers are governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases link v wabash rr co  us    here the judges utilization of the dismissal sanction was not only appropriate on the facts of this case but was a realistic measure undertaken to protect the integrity of the pending litigation and the superior court as well as to send an appropriate message to those who would so abuse the courts of the commonwealth to limit as munshani suggests punishment for such conduct to repayment of the costs of uncovering the fraud could actually encourage similar fraud in other high stakes cases a devious litigant might embark on a scheme to engage in complex electronic fraud calculating the possibility that even if caught he or she could simply pay the bill and proceed with the litigation the judge here imposed a sanction that allowed zero tolerance for sophisticated computer fraud and evidence tampering that sanction was within the judges discretion page  munshani devotes much of his brief to arguing that the judge failed to apply the proper factors before invoking the sanction of dismissal in this case specifically munshani argues that the judge should have but did not consider the five specific factors discussed by this court in keene v brigham  womens hosp inc  mass app ct     sc  mass   that case concerned the entry of a default as a sanction for the defendants failure to produce lost records pursuant to massrcivp bc as amended  mass   the flaw in munshanis analysis is that the keene factors applied to sanctions for nonwilful failure to comply with discovery orders ie to records that had been lost not the significantly more egregious type of conduct which is at issue in this case dismissal an admittedly drastic sanction to be utilized only in extreme situations see monahan v washburn  mass     was warranted here judgment affirmed footnotes note  signal lake ii llc signal lake ii strategic partners llc signal lake management llc barton w stuck and michael e weingarten note  munshani does not appeal the order to pay costs and attorneys fees in addition he expressly concedes them as appropriate in his appellate brief note  munshani vs terago communications inc  another us dist ct no cv rgs d mass note  the judges determinations of materiality and fraud on the court were based upon an analysis of facts and constituted rulings of law note  it strikes us as elementary that a    court possesses the inherent power to deny the courts processes to one who defiles the judicial system by committing a fraud on the court aoude v mobil oil corp  fd at  note  nothing in rockdale suggests that dismissal is appropriate only in cases of fraud on the court we do not read rockdale as placing any limitation on a
