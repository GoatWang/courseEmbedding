cloe c level  contributor  reviews  attraction reviews  helpful votes “paradise 💙” reviewed  august  via mobile such a wonderful day out i had to do it twice the boat offers a fun day frolicking in the crystal clear waters of the blue lagoon whether you choose to spend the day soaking up the sun sipping pina coladas on the sun deck snorkeling the turquoise water or whizzing around gozo its an experience i wont forget on my second trip i took the optional speed boat ride through the caves with oki koki or his dad crazy tony and it was worth every penny the boat offers a full range of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages as well as surprisingly good food i recommend the chicken ciabatta  the staff are highly interactive and speak multiple languages visited august  helpful thank cloe c

girlfriend and i had an awesome day on the hornblower cruise and we cant thank kevin and his staff enough for the great experience we knew that we wanted to do a cruise to the blue lagoon but with so many different options and everyone offering similar things it was hard to choose we are so glad that we chose hornblower over the rest hornblower has the best spot in the lagoon where you are free to jump off the boat directly into the water with plenty of space to swim around plus theres an awesome sun deck where we spent the entire day the other boats that came to the lagoon were packed with people we had so much space no deck space to lay out and no swimming space we wouldve been miserable on another boat no doubt thank you kevin for a great day visited august  helpful thank casey m

reviewed  august  via mobile booked the hornblower cruise to the blue lagoon after popping in to itour malta across from the great wall chinese in bugibba near the bus station it costs € pp  if you also want to do the gozo trip but we chose not to the € trip to the blue lagoon is a  hour stay we got on the boat and on the way the staff on board were helpful they gave facts and monuments pointed out as we were on the way to the blue lagoon when we arrived at the blue lagoon it was really busy we got off the boat to have a bit of an explore  absolutely nowhere to sunbathe or even sit comfortably extremely rocky leaving us with either spending  hours stood around or  hours in the water fine for my boyfriend but i wanted to sunbathe  this would have been a massive issue had we been with any other cruise but the hornblower we went back to the boat were the top deck was a sunbathing area they had deckchairs free of charge and fake grass they also had steps into the blue lagoon as well as a platform from both decks to jump into the water they had toilets on board and sold food burgers chips etc the blue lagoon is beautiful and definitely worth a visit however had i been on another cruise they were all seating only and a lot of them shades i wouldnt have enjoyed my time at the lagoon however the fact that i could relax and sunbathe and then go into the water straight from the boat whenever i fancied was brilliant and my boyfriend loved the snorkelling and jumping in on the way back you see gozo and have a trip into a cave thank you so much stella for recommending it so glad we chose this cruise  visited august  helpful thank maisie f report ask maisie f about hornblower cruises this review is the subjective opinion of a tripadvisor member and not of

really was my favourite part of my holiday from start to finish the views are terrific and the day is packed with things ti do i went on the comino malta gozo trip which takes you from malta to the blue lagoon and then on to gozo and finally back to maltaon the way there is running commentary about the sights and in between there are some retro disco tunes played for your enjoyment the boat moors in blue lagoon where you get an hour to do as you please this is absolutely beautiful with crystal clear waters and the boat has areas where you can jump in so much fun we took the optional half hour speedboat trip which is run by a crazy italian and is good fun on gozo we took the additional minibus tour which takes you to the azure window a church and victoria in my opinion the church is not worth the stop and the time would ve better spent at the azure window which is quite a rushed experience but it becomes apparent that getting your way round the island would be difficult without the help of the touri booked this trip at about  hours the night before boarding even at this time i was able to converse through emails with them to ensure that my trip went smoothly the next day including organising a pick up and drop iff service overall customer service here was brilliant the staff are very friendly and attentive and really make your trip fun and easy worth noting  the base price was  euros which is actually very reasonable the speedboat pick up service and minibus tour are additional extras which cost    euros respectively this takes the total to  euros which in my opinion is still a very good price also there is food and drink available to buy on board which is not too expensive a beer was  overall i would definitely recommend this tour as it was well organised fun and exciting it only drops one star as the azure window was too rushed and the water i bought tasted very bad all else was perfect visited july  helpful  thank tyler s report ask tyler s about
