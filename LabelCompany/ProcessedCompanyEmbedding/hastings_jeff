discusses new product lines  digital signage connection you are athome»media players»brightsign ceo jeff hastings discusses new product lines brightsign ceo jeff hastings discusses new product lines  by jason kushner  dsc editor september   media players brightsign recently announced seven new stateoftheart media players spanning four product lines in response to the everchanging needs of the digital signage and audiovisual industries the free brightauthor companion software and the brightsign network have also been updated with advanced features in what basically amounts to an attempt at futureproofing the entire brightsign product family digital signage connection caught up with the company’s ceo jeff hastings to get more details “five years ago we pioneered the k h decoding to decrease file sizes by up to  percent” said hastings “that’s going to become the industry norm over the next three to five years and we’d like to think that we’re continuing that trend of blazing trails with the capabilities of the new product lines” one of the most exciting new additions is known as mosaic mode and it allows the screen to be divided into zones that add up to the full resolution of the decoder the screen zones could be for a practical purpose or entirely impressionistic if the signage is intended more as décor or ambience the bottom line here is that the new line offers much more control to the author according to hastings the most notable new features other than mosaic mode are more contrast with a wider color palette the thinner displays to meet adi requirements the ability to stream content to another player in real time and most importantly an industrialgrade design with k capability at a low price point in addition the cpu is bonded to an aluminum case for heat dissipation so no cooling fan is necessary plus the thinner bodies make these players less clunky and more aesthetically pleasing for a customerfacing or corporate office environment “you can but you won’t want to hide this player behind the display” hastings added in terms of support brightsign will continue to provide technological advice to customers with the
