per year per kw of peak dc direct current capacity for more information about how your location roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below what rebates solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in california what solar incentives and tax credits are available in california the main incentives to install solar in california is the  federal solar tax credit and the net metering law the upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers however the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates     net metering in california the california public utility commission voted by a narrow majority of  to  to extend the ability of residential energy customers in california to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production whilst this didnt affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in california it was a massive win for the millions of californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels the reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power this is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted it means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility known as a net metering agreement where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power usually for  or  years each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature to see more visit wwwcpuccagovgeneralaspxid     is a purchase lease or ppa agreement best generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home however this is not always the case if you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the  federal solar tax credit in this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit     what is the payback period from installing solar panels in california the payback period from installing solar panels in california is usually between  and  years depending on the size of the system the brand of solar panels you buy the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system this represents an excellent low risk investment     why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in california as california has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power however working this out can be difficult for two reasons firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated the second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices with most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases california solar

to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable on july   mark widmar was appointed ceo of first solar previously he had been chief financial officer company founder and former ceo mike ahearn remains chairman of the board market historyedit historically first solar sold its products to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers early sales were primarily in germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the german renewable energy sources act eeg of  cp solar power in germanycitation needed declines and uncertainty in feedintariff subsidies for solar power in european markets including germany france italy and spain prompted major pv manufacturers such as first solar to accelerate their expansion into other markets including the us india and china beginning in december  first solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utilityscale pv systems in sustainable markets with immediate need as a result it now competes against conventional power generators and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market on february   first

august   first solar increased its estimate for  production to between  and  mws in its financial report for quarter  market performanceedit while first solar witnessed record sales of over  billion in  its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line leading to a net loss of  million – or  per share – for the year historically the low cost of first solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance the use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost  per watt compared to crystallinesilicon pv which averaged  per watt in  as the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utilityscale projects it will need to become price competitive with nonsolar power sources a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency grid parityedit main article grid parity in november  first solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to  cents per watt a cent decrease from february  by  it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between  and  cents the biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency in a december  reneweconomy interview with first solar ceo james hughes he made the following comments regarding grid parity everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – i’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of first solar electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place  there is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity you may have a tariff structure that describes it that way but that is not the reality and frankly sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that so you have to look at time of day season and location to determine the true cost of power and there are lots of times of day seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy so our focus is to find those places find those times of day and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves installationsedit first solar had installed  mw of solar capacity as of  below are some of first solar’s solar installations and development projects north

performanceedit while first solar witnessed record sales of over  billion in  its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line leading to a net loss of  million – or  per share – for the year historically the low cost of first solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance the use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost  per watt compared to crystallinesilicon pv which averaged  per watt in  as the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utilityscale projects it will need to become price competitive with nonsolar power sources a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency grid parityedit main article grid parity in november  first solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to  cents per watt a cent decrease from february  by  it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between  and  cents the biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency in a december  reneweconomy interview with first solar ceo james hughes he made the following comments regarding grid parity everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – i’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of first solar electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place  there is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity you may have a tariff structure that describes it that way but that is not the reality and frankly sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that so you have to look at time

trying amorphous silicon he shifted to cdte at the urging of jim nolan and founded solar cells inc sci in   and the florida corporation in  with jd polk in february  mcmaster sold the company to true north partners an investment arm of the walton family owners of walmart john t walton joined the board of the new company and michael j ahearn of true north became the ceo of the newly minted first solar in its early years first solar module efficiencies were modest about  percent first solar launched production of commercial products in  and reached an annual production of  megawatts mw in  at the end of  first solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt gw and was the largest pv module manufacturer in the world the company is headquartered in tempe arizona and has manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia additionally first solar partnered with natural gas provider enbridge to build the largest pv solar energy farm in the world located in sarnia ontario near the canada–us border in july  first solar formed a utility systems business group to address the largescale pv systems solutions market utility systems are now the companys core business focus with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business on april   first solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide this restructuring process included phasing out operations in frankfurt oder germany and idling four production lines in kulim malaysia  of first solars workforce was laid off as a result of these actions which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand mark widmar the cfo of first solar said we need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable on july   mark widmar was appointed ceo of first solar previously he had been chief financial officer company founder and former ceo mike ahearn remains chairman of the board market historyedit historically first solar sold its products to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers early sales were primarily in germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the german renewable energy sources act eeg of  cp solar power in germanycitation needed declines and uncertainty in feedintariff subsidies for solar power in european markets including germany france italy and spain prompted major pv manufacturers such as first solar to accelerate their expansion into other markets including the us india and china beginning in december  first solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utilityscale pv systems in sustainable markets with immediate need as a result it now competes against conventional power generators and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market on february   first solars cost per watt broke the  barrier reaching  production cost has continued to fall and in february  reached  per watt production historyedit in  the company had  production lines with  megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity each line had a megawatt capacity the first factory was built in ohio followed by a fourline manufacturing plant in frankfurt oder germany in april  the firm announced the construction of a plant in kulim hitech park malaysia which was expanded

financial report for quarter   earnings call first solar to boost production as profit sales climb wall street journal august   first solar increased its estimate for  production to between  and  mws in its financial report for quarter  market performanceedit while first solar witnessed record sales of over  billion in  its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line leading to a net loss of  million – or  per share – for the year historically the low cost of first solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance the use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost  per watt compared to crystallinesilicon pv which averaged  per watt in  as the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utilityscale projects it will need to become price competitive with nonsolar power sources a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency grid parityedit main article grid parity in november  first solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to  cents per watt a cent decrease from february  by  it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between  and  cents the biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency in a december  reneweconomy interview with first solar ceo james hughes he made the following comments regarding grid parity everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – i’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of first solar electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place  there is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity you may have a tariff structure that describes it that way but that is not the reality and frankly sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that so you have to look at time of day season and location to determine the true cost of power and there are lots of times of day seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy so our focus is to find those places find those times of day and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves installationsedit first solar had installed  mw of
