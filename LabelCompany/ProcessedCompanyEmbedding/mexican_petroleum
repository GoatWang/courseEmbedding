in mexico before edit edward l doheny california oil entrepreneur in mexico petroleum was known in mexico before the arrival of the spaniards and used by the natives for incense and to repair canoes in mexicos colonial era  ranchers lost cattle to tar pits in the gulf coast region so it was considered more of a hazard than a valuable resource exploratory wells were first drilled in mexico in  by mexican and some us entrepreneurs development of petroleum took place as mexicos railway system was developed in the s and s allowing petroleum to reach export markets before that there was no internal market for mexican petroleum and no way for petroleum to be easily exported by  commercial production of crude oil in mexico had begun california oil entrepreneur edward l doheny opened the ebano oil field along the mexican central railway in  the veracruz legislature passed a law titled “ley sobre subdivision de la propiedad territorial under which the state gave land titles to private owners the privatization of land allowed state to declare any land that was not privatized to be public land in  the mexican congress passed the “ley de colonization which allowed private land companies to survey public lands for the purpose of subdivision and settlement for their work surveying this public land the company would receive onethird the surveyed land and gave them the opportunity to buy the remaining twothirds at a very low cost this allowed more than  million acres of mexican land to be owned by the surveyors by the early twentieth century the reapportionment was complete the law divided former communal land and large estates into small privately owned lots dealing with private landowners made it easier for foreign oil companies to buy or lease oil property many property owners considered the upfront bonus they received for leasing their property to be “easy money” a typical oil lease allowed the property owners remain on the land if the company did not start producing oil from the land within the term of the lease commonly five years the company would leave and the owner still had the lease bonus money july  british entrepreneur weetman pearson struck oil in san diego de la mar a coproprietorship that had been divided up into  individual lots due to the privatization of lands in  president porfirio díaz had contracted british weetman pearson to engineer several major projects in mexico such as the drainage of mexico city the dredging of veracruz harbor and the building of the southern vera cruz tehuantepec isthmus railroad line mexican president porfirio díaz also encouraged pearson to develop petroleum reserves resulting in the highly successful compañia mexicana de petróleo el águila exploiting the potrero del llano reserves located near the central gulf of mexico coast town of tuxpán this furthered fueled a massive land rush by the foreign oil companies the two main companies edward doheny’s huasteca petroleum and weetman pearson’s el aguila were able to secure a large sum of land rights through ownership and leasing by  huasteca petroleum owned or leased  acres and el aguila  acres of land respectively pearson subsequently sold his shares el aguila to royal dutch shell although el aguila continued to have a majority of british investors mexico became an oil exporting nation in  with the first shipment leaving the gulf coast port of tampico article  of the constitution of  granted the mexican government the permanent and complete rights to all subsoil resources this would cause conflicts between the mexican government and foreign companies and “lay basis for a twentyoneyear struggle” between mexico and foreign oil companies foreign oil companies questioned if article  would be applied retroactively leading to expropriation of oil rights by the mexican government at the end of world war i the united states was concerned with rapid exhaustion of domestic oil resources united states imports of crude oil nearly all of it from mexico rose rapidly from  million barrels in  to more than  million barrels per year from  to  before declining the demand for mexican oil imports was increased by the united states conservation of oil movement the united states saw mexican oil as an opportunity and the us business interests were heavily backed by the united states government in  president plutarco elías calles decreed that foreign oil companies must register their titles and limited their concessions to fifty years starting in  and extending into the s mexico was second behind the united states in petroleum output and led the world in oil exports oil production and exports from  were at historic high levels in  production was in thousands of barrels of  gallons each

emergence as a more attractive source of petroleum output fell to just  of its  level production began to recover with the  discovery of the poza rica field near veracruz which would become mexicos main source of petroleum for the next several decades  expropriationedit main article mexican oil expropriation lázaro cárdenas del río president of mexico from  to  in  cárdenas ordered the expropriation of all oil companies in mexico the expropriation of lands by the mexican government started with the ratification of the mexican constitution of  by nationalizing the land mexico and the people would be better able to control working conditions pay and environmental impact however this privatization of land further marginalized the indigenous population in  all companies in the business of oil production in mexico were foreign companies labor practices in these companies poorly benefited the workers since the companies were able to block the creation of labor unions through legal and illegal tactics despite legal opposition the confederation of mexican workers was created and proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company a strike was planned to push towards an agreement but the matter went to the court instead on december  the arbitration board declared in favor of the union and ordered the oil companies had to pay  million pesos in lost wages because of the strike faced with political difficulties in mexico as well as the intrusion of saltwater into some of the major producing field the united states and other foreign oil companies began to seek other sources of supply particularly in venezuela and interest in the middle east intensified as well  foreign oil companies continued to pump as much oil as quickly as possible for exportation until the mexican expropriation in  “ignoring reasonable conservation measures to export as much oil as quickly as possible” “mexico only found itself compelled by the rebellious and defiant conduct of the oil companies that is decreed the expropriation of their properties” the united states refusal to recognize and work with mexico’s postrevolution government along with a very hazardous work environment that lead to workers strikes and revolts forced the mexican government to expropriate the land on march   mexican president lázaro cárdenas announced the nationalization of all oil resources and facilities in mexico the government assumed control of all property of nearly every oil company operating in mexico including machinery equipment buildings refineries gas stations ships and pipelines at the time the countrys oil industry was dominated by mexican eagle petroleum company a subsidiary of royal dutch shell and american oil firms such as jersey standard and standard oil of california on june   the stateowned company petróleos mexicanos or pemex was founded with exclusive rights over exploration extraction refining and commercialization of oil in mexico international reaction to expropriationedit the british government demanded immediate compensation for the mexican eagle petroleum company however the company had been founded as a mexican company under mexican law therefore the british government couldn’t intervene directly in the company’s favor diplomatic relations between the countries were soon broken but not before mexico paid a debt claimed by the british government for damages caused during the mexican revolution the government of the netherlands sent business manager arthur methöfer to defend the interests of their citizens methöfer refused to recognize the legality of the expropriation and demanded the immediate return of expropriated property or immediate payment as compensation mexican secretary of foreign affairs eduardo hay reaffirmed that the mexican government was willing and committed to pay compensation within the stipulated time period as the dutch government began to realize the cárdenas government would not reverse the expropriation decree the anglodutch company royal dutch shell decided to pressure mexico without the help of the government negotiations with the united states went differently during cárdenas’s speech he claimed that the resources in the subsoil belonged to the mexican nation and therefore would not be considered as part of the compensation to foreign businesses the companies however assumed compensation should include the fuel that was estimated to be found in the soil president franklin d roosevelt in a public speech recognized the right of mexico to expropriate the oil properties and agreed to accept compensation for the properties of the companies excluding underground oil boycottedit in retaliation for the expropriation standard oil of new jersey and royal dutch shell began a boycott against mexico the companies tried to prevent mexico from acquiring chemicals necessary to the process of refining such as tetraethyl lead and specialized machinery this plan was supported by several american companies which refused to sell certain products to mexico such as drilling equipment pumps ethyl fluid air compressors and electrical equipment soon after students at the instituto politécnico nacional and the national autonomous university of mexico were able to synthesize tetraethyl lead a popular gasoline additive at the time used for boosting octane ratings gradually companies that sold parts and equipment gave in as mexico opted to buy from germany italy and other european countries the us state department assisted with the boycott in various ways purchases of mexican silver were suspended which represented an average amount of  million annually although after  sales were resumed in smaller quantities and lower prices in the united states government departments prohibited the use of mexican fuel preference was given to the importation of venezuelan oil the import tax for mexican oil increased from  to  cents on the dollar while venezuelan oil was only taxed at  cents shipping agencies were pressured not to transport mexican oil world war iiedit manuel ávila camacho was elected president of mexico in  with the development of world war ii franklin delano roosevelt was more interested in forming a strategic alliance with mexico to create an antifascist front than in protecting private companies the us government required cooperation to guard its borders and coastlines and to secure the supply of raw materials including oil as a result the good neighbor policy was signed on november   the mexican government agreed to pay  million for claims originating from the mexican revolution and the us government opened a line of credit in order to stabilize the mexican currency the state department also resumed purchases of silver from mexico and investments were made in mexico’s transportation infrastructure in  mexico had voted during the panamerican conference in favor of establishing continental

industry of mexico the  constitution after years of civil war the mexican government created a new constitution in  some say with justification that this  constitution was the first socialist constitution it preceded the constitution of the soviet union by a year article  of that  constitution declared that all subsoil minerals including petroleum and other hydrocarbons belonged to the nation ie the government supposedly this was progressive but in fact it simply copied the position of the spanish monarchs the only differences is that the spanish monarchs did not know about petroleum and hydrocarbons since these were not declared minerals the landowners before  were entitled to harvest them or sell the rights to do so the mexican revolutionaries of  were only doing what the spanish monarchy would have done if it still controlled mexico the truth of the matter is that what is labeled socialism is merely a form of feudalism it was very natural probably inevitable for the revolutionaries rising to power through military action to establish a variety of feudalism once in power the rhetorical benevolence of monarchy is no less lofty than that of the rhetoric of socialism and the performance of socialistic government no more impressive in serving the interests of the population than that of monarchic govenment the  constitution which declared petroleum and other hydrocarbons to be the property of the state was not enforced retroactively the leases of oil rights to companies even foreign companies were allowed to stand but land owners who had not leased those oil rights by the time of the constitution no longer had ownership of those rights the  constituition also provided for the recognition of organized labor and the right to strike this element proved to be a crucial factor in the way in which the petroleum industry was expropriated by the mexican government under lázaro cárdenas in  the early history of the petroleum industry humans had been acquainted with petroleum literally rock oil from time immemorial it was found as a seepage various places in the world it had been used as an ointment and salve the thicker variety and asphalt were used as a caulking in  a commissioner for a british mining company in mexico reported that great quantities of seepage petroleum called chapapote were marketed in tampico a town near the panuco river in southern mexico it was used as varnish and to cover the bottoms of canoes the going price was a half dollar per  pounds colonel drake drilled the first commercial oil well in the world in  in western pennsylvania there had been exploitation of natural gas from drilled wells in ancient china but no prior exploitation of petroleum from drilled wells petroleum did show up as a nuisance in well drilled for water and there was some utilization of this petroleum as an ungent and as an ingredient in medical concoctions of dubious value the petroleum industry was not launched until a decline in the supply of whale oil for lamps led to a significance price increase in whale oil price the search for substitutes for whale oil revealed that a distillate from petroleum kerosene provided a satisfactory fuel for illumination it was then that the drilling of oil wells became commercially feasible eight years after that first oil well in western pennsylvania in  someone drilled a shallow  foot deep well in mexico not enough oil was found to justify commercial operation but a few years later a small refinery was built in the region to process seepage oil later over the period  to  a boston drilled several well in the tuxpám region but did not find enough oil to justify commercial exploitation before petroleum was discovered in commercial amounts in mexico mexico was dependment upon imports of petroleum products particularly kerosene the importation distribution and marketing of kerosene and other petroleum products was solely in the hands of one american firm waterspierce oil co the price of kerosene in mexico during that time was about  us cents per gallon this was the era of the porfiriato in  porfirio díaz invited weetman pearson of the british construction company of s pearson and sons ltd to come to mexico to construct a railroad across the isthmus of tehuantepec weetman dickinson pearson was a son of one the sons of the founder samuel pearson it is notable that before it was known that mexico had petroleum fields the government was not willing to risk public funds to explore for oil there was too much of a risk that there wasnt any petroleum there the construction crews for the railroad found seepage petroleum and later the firm drilled oil wells to obtain fuel for the railroads locomotives that driling found oil in commercial quantities this was in the early s weetman pearson later known as lord cowdray created the mexican eagle oil company cia mexicana de petroleo el aguila sa in  which went on to become the dominant firm in the mexican petroleum industry until expropriation in  a major part of the reason for the mexican eagle oil companys success was the special favors granted to it by porfirio díaz before his downfall in  in several mexican states eagle oil had the exclusive right to explore for oil the mexican public benefited from the success of eagle oil because the price of kerosene fell from  per gallon to about  per gallon flag ofcia mexicana de petroleo el aguila sathe mexican eagle oil co drilled in northern part of the state of veracruz and in the vicinity of tuxpám in  the mexican eagle oil co brought in a gusher at potrero de llano this gusher was brought under control and was a very productive oil well this was not always the case with gushers in  the pennsylvania oil co was drilling at the shore of lake tamiahua between tampico and tuxpám the drilling had reached a depth of  feet and the crew took a break for lunch while they were eating the tremendous pressures below broke through into the drill hole the gas and oil not only blew through the drill hole but created fissures around the drill hole the gas and oil caught fire the fire and the fissures led to the collapse of soil around the drill hole and eventually the oil derrick and all the equipment dropped out of sight into the crater which was created the site became known as dos bocas two mouths and the cratered area eventually covered a  acre area this gusher turned out to be a far greater loss than a dry hole important cities of mexico for the oil industry oil wells and drilling sites the locations of the major oil fields are shown below oil fields of mexico c  when american oil companies heard about the gusher oil wells that had been found in mexico they entered to the market by founding subsidiary companies for mexico here are some of the new oil companies for mexico mexican oil companycontrolling company richmond petroleum coof mexicostandard oil of california california standard

success of these companies can be read in the statistics on petroleum production in mexico yearproductions brls                                 the organized labor movement in mexico the  constitution provided for the right of workers to organize the eighthour workday is stipulated in that constitution at a minimum wage sufficient to satisfy the normal necessities of life it also provided for equal pay for equal work without regard to gender race or ethnicity but it also provided for special protection of working women and minors the constitution also provided for the creation of arbitration boards made up of equal numbers of representatives from management and labor with one government representative to serve as tiebreaker strikes were legal if they were to redress the balance of power between labor and management the full provisions of the constitution with regard to labor relations were not implemented immediately but strong unions were organized in the years immediately after  in particular the petroleum workers were organized the oil workers union did use its power to raise the nominal real wage of workers so much as it promoted overstaffing and thus the reduction of work effort effectively raising the real wage per hour worked the principle of no reelection that came to prevail in the political sphere did not apply in organized labor and many of the labor union leaders continued in power for decades labor unions became the archetype institution for the corporatist state of mexico the nationalization of the mexican petroleum industry lázaro cárdenas who was president of mexico from  to  was an ardent collectivist it is not surprising that the bolshevik leon trotsky chose cárdenist mexico as his place of refuge cárdenas began implementing the provisions of the  constitution he distributed  million hectares of land to the communal farming ejidos this was more than all of the redistributions of his predecessors combined cárdenas sanctioned the formation of a stronger national confederation of organized labor under the control of a marxist vicente lombardo toledano this confederación de trabajadores mexicanos ctm is the strongest labor organization in mexico there is an umbrella organization congreso de trabajo ct that presides over the ctm and other unions but it is the ctm that has the real clout the ctm replaces the older more moderate national labor union confederación regional obrera mexicana crom as the leader of the mexican labor movement the petroleum workers union was one of the most powerful in mexico petroleum workers received substantially higher pay than mexican workers in other industries a mexican government survey in  found the following comparisons comparison of daily wage rates in the petroleum industry and the average of all mexican industries by occupation c  occupationpetroleumindustrypesosdayaverage for all mexican industriespesosday blacksmiths electricians masons carpenters chauffeurs stevedores unskilled the comparison by industry is also of interest average wages in various industries in mexico c  industryaverage dailywagepesos average annualwagepesos petroleum electrical power street railways mining textiles these were the relatively highpaying industries of the time the petroleum industries was high above all others in the direct wage but employees in the petroleum industry also had substantial fringe benefits that employees in the other industries did not have these fringe benefits included free company housing free medical benefits for the workers and their immediate families and schools for the workers children these fringe benefits had a value roughly equal to fifty percent of the wage pay the petroleum workers union had effectively achieved a closed shop in  the petroleum companies could not hire employees who were not members of the union the company could not fire any employee without paying very substantial severance pay but the union could expel any member which meant their loss of their job with the company this provision meant that the union officials had more power over employees than did their company employers this provision was put into the petroleum workers labor contract at the insistance of president abelardo rodriguez the immediate predecessor of lázaro cárdenas cárdenas reorganized the official political party giving it the institutional structure that enabled it to rule mexico for seventy years under cárdenas reorganization the party had four sectors  labor  agrarian  military  popular later the military sector was merged with the popular sector cárdenas renamed the party as the partido de la revolución mexicana but in  it was again renamed as the partido revolucionario institucional pri under cárdenas reorganization the labor sector of the party was essentially the congreso de trabajo the umbrella organization of the labor movement in  the labor unions in most of the foreign petroleum companies went on strike estensibly for higher pay and more training of mexican workers for the more technical jobs in the industry in reality the goal was to take control of the petroleum companies the demands of the union were so excessive that the companies could not grant them and still function for more on the union demands cádenas intervened demanding compliance with the workers demands it is alleged that in the negotiations with the president some agreement was reached but the petroleum company representatives insisted that the agreement be put into writing this was supposed to have impuned cárdenas integrity at honoring his word piqued cárdenas executed orders for the expropriation of the foreign oil companies properties no compensation was paid at the time of expropriation in  but later compensation was made at the value the companies had reported for tax purposes there were international protests but the nationalization of the foreign oil interests held the cost to mexico was not just the compensation paid the far greater cost was the loss of sources of capital for mexico for about twenty years in addition mexican petroleum production declined and at times mexico was a net importer of petroleum furthermore the labor union of oil workers controlled the staffing of the national petroleum company pemex and vastly overstaffed it when president salinas in  forced the laying off of excess workers the number of excess workers proved to be equal to about  percent of the necessary workers so from nationalization in  to the reorganization in  a good share of the earnings of the national petroleum company went not to the government of mexico but to the labor union distribution of petroleum production in mexico the distribution of production among the various oil fields in the s shows their relative importance in that period it was the poza rica which was dominant  shares of production field poza rica pánucoebano faja de orogolden lane isthmus detehuantepec reynosa

orogolden lane isthmus detehuantepec reynosa the impact of the nationalization although usually the impact of nationalization is depicted in terms of the effect on petroleum production this is not the crucial problem the crucial problem is the effect on the development of new producing oil wells the table below shows that in the period  the private oil industry was bringing in about three hundred new producing wells per year in was about  that the mexican government began talking about controlling the petroleum industry immediately the exploration began to drop and continued dropping the petroleum companies had alternative development sites in venezuela colombia and the far east that seemed safer investments by the time the actual nationalization came in  the annual development of new successful oil wells was a small fraction of what it had been in the mids not all of the private petroleum companies were nationalized in  only the ones which were involved in labor disputes in  the national petroleum company pemex was not notably successful in developing new wells the problem was not that it had a lower success rate than the private companies the problem was that it just did not drill many wells bureaucrats with their careers on the line have a problem with risktaking no bureaucrat wants to have to explain the loss of public funds in a dry hole after world war ii the development of new wells increased from the negligible levels of the early s but still the number of new producing oil wells developed in the decade after nationalization was less than the number broughtin in  although production from the wells expropriated in  was maintained after a few years of declined production the nationalization during that first decade was a financial failure costs rose because of overstaffing promoted by the oil workers union pemex had a difficult time meeting minimal financial obligations to the mexican government

development of new oil wells improved in  when pemex began contracting with foreign petroleum companies to drill under contract the payment for the drilling was a share of the oil found thus the risk of drilling was shifted to the drilling companies to be continued home page of appletmagic home page of thayer watkins mexican petroleum by products suppliers mexican petroleum by products
