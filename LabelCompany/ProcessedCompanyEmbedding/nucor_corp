scratch or acquired are unionized and nucor is opposed to unions believing them to be a destructive force in the us steel industry no nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election even though nucor management has not engaged in the controversial union busting tactics adopted by some companies and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates working together towards a common goal decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem instead of up to management that allows decisions and improvements to be made faster and often better decentralized management philosophyedit nucor is highly decentralized in its operations there are only five managerial levels at nucor supervisorprofessional department manager division general manager executive vice president and presidentceocitation needed most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower in addition nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around  employees which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporationscitation needed performance based compensationedit all nucor employees from senior officers to hourly employees are covered under one of four basic compensation plans in addition to base pay which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets production incentive plan operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group which can average from  to  percent of an employees base pay department manager incentive plan department managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division these bonuses can be as much as  percent of a department managers base pay professional and clerical bonus plan this bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the divisions net income return on assets senior officers incentive plan nucors senior officers do not have employment contracts they do not participate in any pension or retirement plans their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies the remainder of their compensation is based on nucors annual overall percentage of net income to stockholders equity and is paid out in cash and stock in addition nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees except officers in years of particularly strong company performance this bonus has been as high as  for each employeecitation needed egalitarian benefitsedit nucors senior officers are not provided traditional perks such as company cars executive parking spaces or executive dining rooms though in august  the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior managementcitation needed a letter was sent to the home of every nucor explaining the why the jet was needed it was important to nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion ken iverson’s book plain talk specifically pointed out that nucor didn’t have a company plane so it was seen as a big change several programs such as nucors profit sharing scholarship program employee stock purchase plan extraordinary bonus and service awards program are not available to nucors officers but only to lowerlevel employees each annual report since  has listed the names of every employee in the nucor  annual report it took  pages to list the names of all  employees technological leadershipedit in  nucor was among the first steel companies in the united states to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel primarily from junked automobiles the first thin slab production was started in  in crawfordsville in thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel in  nucor recycled nearly  million cars in its production processes the equivalent of one suv every four secondscitation needed currently nucor in conjunction with two foreignowned steel companies operates two facilities in crawfordsville indiana and blytheville arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy expensive and energyconsuming rollers the process known as castrip allows an entire mill to be built in  the space of a minimill and at  the cost of a traditional integrated mill they call this concept a micromillcitation needed controversiesedit

supplies ferroalloys and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap historyedit nucors history consists of distinct eras the reo motor car era the nuclear corporation of america era the iverson years – the dimicco era  and the ferriola era –present the reo motor car eraedit nucors origins are with auto manufacturer ransom e olds who founded olds motor vehicle company in  later as oldsmobile to become a part of general motors corporation in  olds left oldsmobile and established a new company reo motor car company in lansing michigan though olds products including the luxurious reo flying cloud car and reo speed wagon truck were popular they were not profitable and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in  after the bankruptcy reorganization reo exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses in december  reo sold its entire manufacturing operations to bohn aluminum and brass corporation the nuclear corporation eraedit the company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations but a group of dissident activist shareholders noticing the existence of a usable tax loss successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in september  and forced reo to take over a tiny nuclear services company called nuclear consultants inc in a reverse takeover the company was renamed nuclear corporation of america inc and relocated to offices in the empire state building in new york city nuclears attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful and it followed the example of other companies in the s and s and attempted to become a conglomerate moving its headquarters to phoenix arizona it made several acquisitions including vulcraft corporation a steel joist manufacturer located in florence south carolina vulcraft had been founded by sanborn chase no relation to chase  sanborn coffee who died at an early age leaving the company to his widow nuclear purchased vulcraft from chases widow in  and hired f kenneth iverson as general manager the conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in march  filed for bankruptcy the board of directors fired nuclears president and had to return his private jet to him but could not find a replacement eventually samuel siegel an accountant with nuclear and friend of iverson who had been looking to leave the company informed the board that he would remain with the company under two conditions iverson would become president and he siegel would become chief financial officer conditions the board accepted the nucor iverson eraedit iverson and siegel reorganized nucor around its only profitable business the steel fabricator vulcraft all other businesses were either sold or liquidated the company moved its headquarters to charlotte north carolina in  to be closer to its main vulcraft plant unable to get favorable steel prices from american manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time iverson a metallurgist by training decided to extend nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in darlington south carolina in  the company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace with a us  loan secured by all of the companys assets production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in  and  in  the company recognizing that the company was misnamed adopted its current name since that time nucor has expanded into other steel products gained some control of its raw material supply became a leader in recycling technology and expanded its market presence in  nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of  the company opened its building products division that same year in  nucor opened a facility in crawfordsville indiana which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thinslab technology

offices outside the us include locations in colombia mexico switzerland and the united arab emirates the nucor cultureedit nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy performance based compensation egalitarian benefits customer service quality and technological leadership none of nucors plants whether built from scratch or acquired are unionized and nucor is opposed to unions believing them to be a destructive force in the us steel industry no nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election even though nucor management has not engaged in the controversial union busting tactics adopted by some companies and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates working together towards a common goal decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem instead of up to management that allows decisions and improvements to be made faster and often better decentralized management philosophyedit nucor is highly decentralized in its operations there are only five managerial levels at nucor supervisorprofessional department manager division general manager executive vice president and presidentceocitation needed most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower in addition nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around  employees which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporationscitation needed performance based compensationedit all nucor employees from senior officers to hourly employees are covered under one of four basic compensation plans in addition to base pay which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets production incentive plan operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group which can average from  to  percent of an employees base pay department manager incentive plan department managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division these bonuses can be as much as  percent of a department managers base pay professional and clerical bonus plan this bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the divisions net income return on assets senior officers incentive plan nucors senior officers do not have employment contracts they do not participate in any pension or retirement plans their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies the remainder of their compensation is based on nucors annual overall percentage of net income to stockholders equity and is paid out in cash and stock in addition nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees except officers in years of particularly strong company performance this bonus has been as high as  for each employeecitation needed egalitarian benefitsedit nucors senior officers are not provided traditional perks such as company cars executive parking spaces or executive dining rooms though in august  the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior managementcitation needed a letter was sent to the home of every nucor explaining the why the jet was needed it was important to nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion ken iverson’s book plain talk specifically pointed out that nucor didn’t have a company plane so it was seen as a big change several programs such as nucors profit sharing scholarship program employee stock purchase plan extraordinary bonus and service awards program are not available to nucors officers

ccppmi board interactions committee boundaries committee and software certification committee david i cleland university of pittsburgh richard w kimball westinghouse electric corporation this is an abridged version of the article which originally appeared in the pmj vol  no  august  pp  owners and stakeholders every project has several stakeholders in the success or failure of the project at a minimum you have the customer recipient of the output of the project and supplier provider of the output of the project usually the customer has the most at stake because he is depending upon the success of this project to make his programs or enterprise successful he is also usually the main contributor of funds for the project the supplier enterprise on the other hand also has a lot at stake in addition to the usual risks of customer dissatisfaction reputation and cost overruns the supplier enterprise has the ongoing success of that enterprise at stake project’s strategic role projects are essential to the survival and growth of organizations failure in project management in an enterprise can impact the ability of the organization to accomplish its mission objectives and goals the greater the use of projects in accomplishing organizational purposes the more dependent the organization is on the effective and efficient management of those projects projects and organizational management projects goals and objectives must fit together in a synergistic fashion in supporting the enterprise mission project success by itself may not lead to enterprise success however appropriately chosen projects may support and contribute to enterprise strategy successful project management depends on senior enterprise management for authority strategic guidance and support senior managers in turn depend on project managers for timely costeffective achievement of project results to support corporate strategy project management is a form of “strategic delegation” whereby senior managers delegate to project managers the authority and responsibility to do such things as building capital facilities introducing new products conducting research and development and creating new marketing and production opportunities project management is also a type of strategic management control senior managers can use project management as a way to ensure that key strategies are accomplished in an effective manner a senior manager oversees the strategic direction of the enterprise through providing resources to accomplish mission objectives goals and strategies the management of projects is inseparable from the management of the enterprise consequently project success and failure will impact organizational success and failure recognizing this project owners need to be aware of the strategic context of their projects an interview with keith busse “project manager” preface by richard kimball pmj interviewer it was my pleasure to have the opportunity to meet with and discuss the nucor flat products steel project with keith busse it was not long into our discussion before i was caught up in his enthusiasm with his job this project and the cultural ambience of the nucor corporation nucor is not a big company by many standards but it is unique in many ways with sales in  of  million it has an executive management of only  monitoring the operations of  plants and  employees the corporation has its own distinct culture which reflects chairman and ceo f kenneth iversons personal philosophy they are proud of and boast at being one of the nations low cost steel producers it is a very entrepreneurial company which gives its management and employees a lot of responsibility and authority and encourages them to take prudent risks in meeting their objectives and job responsibilities the company is very loyal to their employees offering a high degree of job security a portion of all employees compensation is based on the productivity and success of the corporation it seems as if every employee wears several hats they have  a functional job assignment falling within a fairly rigid classical management structure  a matrix structure of mutual dependence on each other in fulfilling daily tasks and  frequent ad hoc assignments many times in areas not associated with their functional responsibilities in many ways they are the antithesis of a project management organization as we in pmi would conceive it for this project keith busse as the executive in charge is as close as they come to having a project manager keith busses explanation is that nucor is too small to maintain a formal project management structure                                pmj what do you do with the people when the project is complete busse we do not have an ongoing series of projects at any one location to assign them to it is our philosophy to assign a person their ultimate functional assignment and to assign them project tasks or responsibilities related reasonably close to their final role during the project implementation for example we already have a traffic manager presently he is concerned with the problems associated with arrival of all the construction materials storage protection railroad spur roads on site transportation etc when the project is operational he will then concern himself with arrival of raw materials storage transportation costs and shipments of completed product etc all but one of the people working on this project already is aware of what their future position will be the one person not aware is the site construction manager which illustrates my point in this case he will probably be reassigned to operations management or another construction project somewhere as it is relatively easy to move one person but what do you do with fifty people pmj in reality you do have an informal project management structure through complex matrix relationships and ad hoc task assignments the project is going forth and quite well at that keith e busse vice president of nucor and general manager of nucor’s new steel facility at crawfordsville indiana was a key member of the project team during the conceptual phase and now in pmi terms is the project manager of the implementation project team when the project is completed he will continue as the general manager of this new division mr busse started with nucor in  as controller of the st joe division and in  became vice president and general manager he has a bachelor of arts degree from saint francis college and an mba from indiana university he was project manager for the development of nucor’s standing seam roof system and project manager for determining the feasibility of nucor’s entry into the fastener business this was an extremely ambitious project for nucor to undertake are you aware of the strategic motivations behind the decision for nucor’s proceeding with this project busse nucor is an ambitious company we have been growing at a compound annual rate of  over the past ten years while concentrating our efforts in the steel industry we would like to continue this growth in order to do so we must expand our efforts into other growth areas one of our main strategies is to grow within the steel industry our sales represent only a small percentage of the steel market and there is much room for growth for a low cost producer it is our intention to seek areas in the steel business where we can make investments that will result both in reducing the cost of steel and increase our available market while we might never become the biggest steel company our long range objective is to become the premier steel company pmj i believe this is nucor’s first venture into the flat products market can you comment on your strategies for entry into this marketplace busse as indicated in my last answer we are seeking growth in the steel industry flat rolled products represent the largest market for steel products while this is a new venture for nucor it is not a new idea the officers of nucor have been considering this possibility since  we have been actively planning this venture into flat rolled products for three years we are convinced that with today’s technologies we can produce flat rolled products cheaper than others are now doing if we can there is a large additional market available to us not to mention that we can also be a source of lower cost flat products to our sister divisions for nucor this is a large project but as far as the available market we will only make a small dent — initially with that in mind we must learn how to crawl before we walk and walk before we run pmj once the decision was made what factors determined the organizational structure for the conceptualization and procurement phases of the project busse this was handled in the typical nucor manner a small group of nucor executives and other key personnel were assigned the task of doing this in addition to their other duties ken iverson dave aycock and i set out to determine the best site for the plant bill dauksch joe gedris howard reardon and ralph smith had the assignment of scoping out the project and determining the major contractors for all of these people this was a large additional responsibility added on to their already heavy schedules nucor received a lot of help from sms they indicated they had perfected the technology nucor was seeking and volunteered much assistance in helping us to decide exactly what we needed they initially wanted to come in and provide the whole plant on a turnkey basis while we appreciated their interest and assistance we wanted more control of our own destiny pmj can you comment on the strategic factors involved in the selection of the crawfordsville site busse that was an interesting challenge after many months of searching we identified several potential sites in illinois indiana ohio and kentucky pmj why did you concentrate in that area busse the midwest including those four states and michigan represent the largest market  to  for flat rolled steel products these geographic areas also represent the best source for steel scrap since our process utilizes scrap this was an important factor another very important principle of nucor is to build plants only in rural areas we have generally found rural employees to have a better work ethic to be more mechanically skilled to be family oriented to be more readily trainable and to have motivation we try to keep our facilities relatively small under  people in a rural area you can usually find  good employees within a thirty minute commute another criteria was good transportation crawfordsville is on interstate  and there are two major railroads in the vicinity electrical power was also essential and public service of indiana had a  kv transmission line near crawfordsville the utility and nucor eventually reached an agreement wherein nucor would be provided power at an attractive rate yet to the benefit of other ratepayers the nucor facility at crawfordsville will be an enormous consumer of power limited water was one negative concern but on the other hand we did not wish to necessarily locate on the ohio river we have another plant on the river in arkansas and we did not want to compete with them for the available scrap coming down river in this area we can get enough by rail and truck another factor was cooperation from the state of indiana relative to infrastructure grants and taxes conservative politics was also considered as a positive factor land availability was also a key ingredient we required over  acres of land with good soil bearing capacity in crawfordsville we were able to locate the required quantity of land of course we had to negotiate with fourteen different farmers that was fun pmj what were some of the strategic factors nucor considered in undertaking a large investment in the new sms technology busse as mentioned before we had already made the decision to enter the flat rolled products market we were looking for a technology that would reduce the cost of making steel we examined several different processes visited many locations heard many presentations and had a good awareness of what was available the major factor for picking sms was the fact that they already had an operating pilot plant others were saying they could do it but sms had already done it sms provided us great assistance in engineering and specifying plant requirements also sms was very anxious to sell their first operating system as a result we feel we obtained a good price for their equipment future purchases of these technologies may be slightly higher priced sms’s hot mill equipment also offered new technologies such as continuously variable crown control cvc to produce uniform thickness across the sheet and provided us with further opportunities to improve quality and reduce cost we also wanted to be first we had a goal to reach and needed to proceed other companies are watching this project with much interest but by the time it may take some of these organizations to react  years and get operational we will be producing quality low cost steel future developments are the result of one’s learning curve coupled with an aggressive dedication to new cost saving technologies we still have a lot to learn but getting started sooner was important to us pmj how important is this project in the overall strategic thrust of nucor busse very it is a key growth area for us as we proceed we will have  of nucor’s assets tied up in this project we are looking for deeper penetration into the building products area also but growth in steelmaking is a primary objective pmj that is a sizeable investment in one project what if it should fail busse at nucor no one talks of failure the possibility of failure is very remote while we are talking about new technology we have to recognize that almost everything with the exception of the caster has been successfully done before we are utilizing different combinations and more modern equipment but are basically just improving old processes to be more efficient and more productive if a serious performance situation should arise there are alternate technologies available pmj this alternate approach would result in significant delay and additional cost wouldn’t this have a serious financial impact on nucor busse of course it would have a serious impact and we are doing all we can to avoid any such scenario the timetable would get set back and the cost overruns and carrying cost of our investment would have significant impact on our financial statements but it would not break us the majority of our investment is from internal sources so we will not have unreasonably large debt obligations it might cause us to delay or postpone other future investments though pmj as project manager what are your specific objectives and what factors will be measured in determining your success in meeting said objectives busse one primary objective is to reach capacity production within the shortest possible time while maintaining good cost control as it relates to capital staffing and overhead to me this means  or more tons of steel by  another key objective is to produce quality products at minimum cost more effectively than anyone else has done to me this means  less per ton than the cost of producing this same steel today it is also my objective and desire to maintain positive working relationships with employees and management pmj in most companies the transition from the procurement team to the implementation team can be difficult in this project how long did this transition take and were there any specific challenges that you would like to comment on busse generally the transition went quite smoothly i had been involved in the project as a member of management and i also had the lead in determination of the site in this project it was more a change from the conceptual team to the operating team we are still procuring new materials and equipment basically the conceptual team identified the major contributors ie sms westinghouse production machinery klockner ebner etc in april of  i was advised that i was the person chosen to head up this project and the resulting division this provided me several months of overlap with the conceptual team in june we finalized negotiations for the site and in july we were on site pmj how often do you have project reviews with your management and at what level in the corporation are these reviews conducted busse at nucor we have a small close knit management team and are always in contact with each other as a result we don’t need to have all that many formal reviews we do get together frequently to discuss specific issues we submit statistical and status reports to charlotte weekly we also have on site reviews weekly among the management team here at site pmj what organizational factors were utilized in the determination and selection of the nucor project management team busse we function in a complex matrix system and as such we must have very flexible and very compatible people people compatibility is a must for us for any job we hire about one out of every eight interviewed each person who passes early screenings are given aptitude and psychological tests and is interviewed individually by all of the staff managers even though we are in the steel business we do not have an abundance of steel making personnel standing by to step into new assignments in a quite different project such as this as a result we needed to immediately begin building a team we now have  management personnel in the division only four of us are from within nucor no one hired to date ever built a steel mill before kris mcgee the site construction manager however did come from us steel and has considerable steel construction experience most of the others are young managers brought in from various geographies and backgrounds in the flat rolled products area we want people we can train in nucor’s ways without having to “untrain” them first our construction project team consists of the construction manager the only person without a defined future assignment two field shift superintendents one a piping expert and the other a mechanical engineer one clerksecretary and three engineers one electrical one mechanical and one civil each has daily construction responsibility for either the melt shop hot mill or cold mill the five engineers will be turn shift foremen in the mill when we become operational the construction team is supported by future operations management ie cold mill manager hot mill manager melting and casting manager maintenance manager and their staffs maintenance support is in the form of three turn foremen one day turn electrical foreman and four electrical engineers the melting and casting hot mill and cold mill support comes from future turn foremen who have been hired on an ongoing basis our engineering department consists of the manager in charge one engineer two draftsmen and a clerk the aforementioned individuals have the responsibility for both construction budgets and schedules as well as future planning and gearing up for the operational side they are responsible for the construction capital and operating budgets of their specific mill they are also directly responsible for all manpower requirements and vendor relationships how’s that for a complex project matrix when we get fully operational i expect we will have  managers at all levels and disciplines and  total employees pmj as a result of undertaking this project has there been any significant organizational change within the nucor corporation to accommodate this project can you provide any examples busse a change like this can be readily accomplished due to the way we are organized basically two new divisions were created this one and one for our new wide flange beam mill being built in blytheville arkansas i was replaced at st joe from within this resulted in minimal change or disruption to the ongoing business pmj from the external view nucor is considered an organization that relies very heavily on its suppliers to provide a high degree of service and project management capabilities do you feel this is a correct assessment if you do is this primarily a tactical or strategic policy busse yes yes and yes it is true nucor relies very heavily on its suppliers and contractors as i mentioned several times we are a relatively small company and as such we can’t afford to have special disciplines and skills waiting for an event to happen when we buy a product or service we also buy brains and special expertise this is a tactical approach but it evolves from our strategic decision to “run lean and mean” for instance we may get involved in the need to build a substation once every five years we don’t have the expertise for that nor the ability to keep current on the new developments in the electrical industry when we need a substation we go to a westinghouse or a bbc and we buy their product and their knowledge we demand a lot from our suppliers but once we have worked well together we are more likely to specify these goods and services in the future provided they remain competitive another strategic decision is that we always do our own construction management we are sure sms could have done a good turnkey job for us but it is our pocketbook and we want to control it pmj are there any questions you would like to ask or any other comments you may wish to make busse not really i believe we have about exhausted this subject generally we are pleased with the progress of this project and the suppliers’ and contractors’ performance the only area we really misjudged was the amount of engineering required for a project of this magnitude we have utilized lockwood greene and csdi far more than anticipated by the time we are finished our engineering costs will be double what we estimated however even so we have been advised that our engineering costs are only about  of the historic engineering costs for a more conventional plant mills such as this may well pave the way for significant future changes in the steel industry pmj thank you for your very informative and frank presentation of this project and an insight into the strategic thinking of the nucor corporation an interview with jeremy ct thomas preface by richard kimball pmj interviewer in discussions with jeremy thomas it quickly became apparent that he is and recognizes that he is a stakeholder in the nucor flat rolled product plant he was personally active in both obtaining the order and its implementation the process which is at the heart of this project is a development of schloemannsiemag a g of dusseldorf west germany the sms engineering company is a us subsidiary of the sms group of companies the technical name for this process is “compact strip production” or “csp” the csp process combines a new type of continuous caster with direct rolling in a compact hot strip mill this process reduces the production chain from crude steel to hot rolled product dramatically by eliminating a heavy caster slab conditioning reheating and roughing facilities and their accompanying high energy and operating costs the development of this process was a very strategic decision for sms and has required a very large investment once having made that decision a strategic project such as this nucor project became imperative to demonstrate its commercial viability                                pmj according to nucor sms played a very large role during the early stages of this project would you like to comment on that jeremy ct thomas president and ceo of sms engineering inc was and remains very active in the nucor project he has held his present position since  prior to that he was president and ceo of mannesmann demag wean all of his working career has been associated with the steel and metals industry from  to  he held various management and executive positions with united engineering and foundry company from  to  he held various executive positions with wean united inc he was born in london england and served as a second lieutenant in the royal artillery he attended harrow school in great britain the university of pittsburgh and carnegie mellon university thomas schloemann siemag ag of dusseldorf west germany the parent company of sms concast montvale new jersey and sms engineering of pittsburgh pennsylvania along with many others in this country europe and japan recognized the need to develop a caster to produce slabs with a thickness closer to the required thickness entering the finishing train of a hot strip mill after much development work a design was developed and a caster built in sms’s own steel foundry at kreutzal west germany concurrently nucor had been experimenting with casting  inch thick slabs for sheet steel at its darlington south carolina plant using a different technology in addition us steel and bethlehem were jointly working on a  million development project in conjunction with the us department of energy as dave aycock president of nucor was reported as saying in the january   edition of american metal market the sms technology “came along a lot faster than a lot of people thought it might” and added “it’s totally ready for commercial application” tom graham president of us steel in announcing the phase down of the us steelbethlehemdoe project stated “if the wheel’s already been invented allocation of further capital — public or private — would not seem prudent” to revert to your original question yes sms played a large role in convincing nucor that a flat products plant fed by a thin slab caster was a commercially viable concept nucor was continuously updated on the heats poured at sms foundry and the results that were obtained by further roll processing of these slabs in operating conditions pmj obviously this was a very important project for sms our readers would be interested in your comments as to the strategic importance of this project to sms thomas as you can appreciate being the first to come to the market place with thin slab technology was very important to sms but of equal importance was finding a company with the confidence in the process to commit the investment funds to proceed many others without ken iverson’s fortitude have shown considerable interest in the csp process and are waiting for nucor to come into production before making their commitments pmj i assume sms has made a large investment in this new hot mill technology can you provide us any insight into the strategic factors considered in making such an investment thomas you are correct in your assumption sms committed many millions to this development which was foreseen as one of the most important developments in the steel industry in the past twentyfive years the ability to install mini flat product plants at a reasonable investment cost geographically located near to the end user market was foreseen by sms as a logical step for both developed industrial nations as well as for less developed nations pmj nucor does not appear to be overly concerned in sms’s ability to move from a pilot plant to a fully operational mill would you please comment on the strategic importance of the success of this plant to sms thomas the strategic importance of this project to everyone concerned is fairly obvious i do however concur with nucor’s feelings while the plant in our kreutzel foundry has been described as a pilot plant it is in fact a full scale caster that could be located in a steel mill the only limitation was the melting capacity at kreutzel in all other respects it was designed as if for installation in a commercial operation to date more than  successful casts have been made with thicknesses of  inches to  inches and in widths from  inches to  inches pmj how does sms manage its projects in general thomas sms receives orders from its customers under different conditions complete turnkey site management only or equipment supply only with supervision of erection sms has a complete staff to handle total turnkey projects and has installations in many countries of the world construction engineering and civil piping and electrical construction together with equipment installation is subcontracted to contractors with responsibility for these disciplines in addition to acting as prime contractor sms has also acted as technical and commercial leader of consortiums formed to supply complete installations in the event of equipment only supply sms is normally called upon by our customers to supply the services of supervisors of erection who act in an advisory role to the customer’s contractors pmj are you doing anything different or special on this project to assure its success what is your project management structure on this project thomas on the nucor project we have responsibility for mechanical equipment supply only nucor has awarded separate contracts for electrical equipment construction engineering and the complete site preparation and installation supervisors of erection will be supplied to assist nucor’s various contractors the main order for this project was placed with sms ag of west germany who in turn subcontracted the usa supply to its usa subsidiaries sms concast and sms engineering project management and customer contact is handled by the project manager in dusseldorf who coordinates the activities of the three sms companies in accordance with the agreed upon schedule with nucor each company is responsible for its deliveries in accordance with the overall project schedule prepared and maintained in dusseldorf pmj i understand a great deal of interest is being shown in this slab technology thomas yes that is correct the consensus of opinion at the recent “survival strategies iii meeting” held in new york on june  and   was that the future expansion and development of the minimills lies in their ability to enter the flat product market now due to the greatly reduced investment cost for a thin slab caster and mill over a conventional mill the ability to enter the market is within their reach at that same meeting mr james a todd jr president and ceo of birmingham steel corporation stated “we also expect to grow from additional acquisitions and from participation in future thin slab opportunities” he later added “minimills are ideally suited to seize this particular opportunity” pmj are there any questions you would like to ask or any other comments you may wish to make thomas yes related to the subject of nucor and thin slab casting technology at the same steel survival iii meeting in new york ken iverson of nucor announced “one of the important new developments is a process for changing the nozzle with almost no interruption of the cast our original projection of  tons per year capacity was based on shutting down the caster every  hours changing the nozzle and restarting after  minutes the new method obviously provides the potential for increasing the capacity of the mill” other new developments are being worked on and tested at our foundry in kreutzel and continuing research will no doubt produce improvements to the technology pmj thank you for your thoughts on the nucor project and sms’s important role in its success we wish you and all of the other stakeholders in this project a continuation of what has all the appearances of being a very successful project an abridged version of a paper presented by jeremy ct thomas the csp process allows operation of a flat rolled plant with a capacity as small as  tons per year or as large as  million tons or more with moderate investment cost attractive return on investment and low labor costs csp provides unexcelled steel production efficiency the csp process combines a new type of continuous casting which produces slabs as thin as ½ to  inches with direct rolling in a compact hot strip mill strip width can be as wide as  inches the nominal size of steel rolled in conventional inch hot strip mills development the compact strip production process is a development of sms schloemannsiemag ag of düsseldorf west germany the sms group of companies is comprised of a continuous casting group a rolling mills group a press group and a plastics machinery group schloemannsiemag is the world’s largest producer of rolling mills concast is a pioneer in continuous casting concast and its associates have more than  installations worldwide with over  strands sms concast inc of montvale new jersey and sms engineering inc of pittsburgh pennsylvania are whollyowned subsidiaries of sms and are responsible for the parent company’s products and operations in north america new concept very thin slabs the basis of csp is a new type of continuous caster which will produce very thin slabs rather than the conventional inch to inch slabs produced on today’s continuous casters the normal production route for making hot rolled strip involves a continuous caster which delivers the heavier slabs from the caster the slabs move to the slab handling area and then to scarfing stations and the slab reheating furnaces when returned to the hot rolling mill line slabs are first reduced on a roughing train and then on a six or seven stand finishing train the total process from caster through slab reheating process roughing train and the finishing train to hot coil entails a high energy consumption contrary to this the new csp technology casts slabs only ½ to  inches thick immediately followed by direct rolling in a compact hot rolling mill thus the production chain from crude steel to hot rolled product is shortened dramatically eliminating the costly investment of a heavy caster slab conditioning reheating and roughing facilities and their accompanying high energy and operating costs system components caster  with the exception of a unique funnelshaped mold the csp continuous caster is designed with components already well proven in modern slab casting plants the components are of lighter design for the thinner slabs steel is supplied in the normal way from the casting ladle via a shrouding tube into the tundish and thence through a submerged nozzle into the mold the mold is the heart of thin slab casting technology the top region is funnelshaped to accommodate the submerged nozzle and designed for lowstress solidification of the strand shell parallel side walls allow rapid changing of strip width from the control pulpit because of high casting speeds throughput capacity is the same or higher than conventional slab casting plants soaking furnace  upon exiting the caster the slab goes directly into an inline soaking furnace where temperature is equalized still inline with the caster the slabs then move directly into the hot strip mill where they are rolled down to finished thicknesses mill  this is a compact mill developed specially for this application while a conventional hot strip mill would have five or six stands this unit can operate with only four or five stands depending on the maximum strip width and maximum final thickness the reduced heat radiation allows a lower finishing train entry speed and thus less drive power to test and verify the effectiveness of the thinslab casting process a full scale pilot plant at the buschhuetten steel foundry in west germany was installed more than  casts have been made on a wide variety of steel grades the slabs produced have had microstructures better than conventionally cast slabs due to the high solidification rate producing a fine equiaxed primary structure with low central segregation rolling tests at another location were conducted with results equivalent to those obtained from conventionally produced slabs the nucor order at the end of  sms received the first order for a compact strip production plant nucor corporation committed to make the system the basis of a new greenfield plant in crawfordsville indiana the plant is initially designed to produce  short tons per year with a maximum casting speed of  inches per minute slabs will be cast from ½ inches to  inches thick finished strip width will be a maximum of  inches maximum coil weight will be  tons which corresponds to a  foot length of cast thin slab nucor’s plan for this plant includes the following initial coldrolling based on purchased hot band to begin in september of  startup of electric furnace and casting machine for initial hotrun and debugging phase in march of  startup of reheating furnacehot rolling mill complex in april of  the economics the economics are uniquely attractive by all measures reduced capital cost lower operating costs relatively quick return on investment improved yield and quality of product savings in energy consumption reduced inventory costs a dramatic level of steel production efficiency in the csp process the steps between the caster and finishing train are eliminated — with equivalent savings in investment costs there is no slab storage area no need for scarfing nor slab marking no need for slab reheating furnaces and no need for a roughing train compactness of the system also is reflected in building size a conventional  ton per year hot strip mill installed in new zealand required floor area of  square meters a csp mill installation also of  tons per year capacity requires only  square meters only  the size of the conventional the advantages of simplicity and compactness quickly translate into sharply reduced capital requirements the caster alone will cost  or less than a conventional continuous caster table costs comparison  tonsyear plant consider now a comparison of the mill complex part of the csp system with a conventional installation savings are gained in all segments of the mill complex including furnace and related equipment the mill itself and the infrastructure basically the mill segment may cost on the order of  more for the conventional plant the overall investment cost for a conventional plant would be on the order of  greater table  indicates the investment cost difference and also shows a  greater operating cost for the conventional plant in operations improved yield reduces cost there are substantial savings in losses due to crop ends and in scale losses in the slab reheat furnaces and roughing train normally a  inprocess slab inventory is found in continuous casting plants the elimination of slab storage reduces processing time from pour to finished coil by weeks all together these and energy and labor savings result in operating costs which would be  greater for a conventional plant table comparison of energy consumption btuus tons table steel production efficiency savings in energy consumption also is a major factor table  compares energy consumption in btu’s per us ton for various processes energy consumption in all segments is significantly less with the csp thinslabcontinuous casting direct rolling process requiring only  the energy of ingot casting with cold charge rolling finally consider steel production efficiency the united states integrated producers have been making good progress in this area achieving a  level of  manhours per us ton in  an extremely efficient us integrated producer operated at  manhours per us ton with segments of some plants doing even better than that with the csp process we anticipate the level of steel production efficiency to be less than  manhour per ton by  james m fisher vice president computerized structural design inc computerized structural design inc csdi has a long time relationship with many of the divisions of the nucor corporation thus csd’s involvement with nucor steel’s new slab casterhot strip mill is critical not only for the design of the new mill but also to our total involvement with nucor corporation csd is a consulting firm specializing in the design of industrial buildings foundations and special structures much of the firm’s work centers around designbuild projects which demand economical and innovative designs for our clients our involvement with the mill began as consultants to the general manager mr keith busse during the site selection process csdi was called on to help evaluate soil conditions at the various sites being considered for the project soon after the site was selected we were asked by nucor research and development to design the structural steel and the building foundations for the hot mill and for the melt and cast structure because of our previous experiences with nucor we knew that once they called on us to begin a project we had to immediately organize our design team not a day could be lost because of nucor steel’s extremely tight schedule the work on the steel design began in midaugust  with a “handshake” contract final shop drawings for the hot mill were approved by our office in midoctober  just two months after beginning our work simultaneously in october  we were asked to bid on the engineering for the equipment foundations for the hot mill again knowing the demands that would be placed on the successful bidder by nucor we formulated our design team from the point of view of the management at csdi there was a major risk in taking on the foundation work on the hot mill this type of work is drafting intensive and required the resources of about onehalf of our drafting staff the danger related to the potential loss of other existing clients that might require services during this same period of time we were successful and obtained the contract the project management system which was put in place began performing in fact we realized that we were not tapped out as far as our resources thus we negotiated additional foundation work with nucor relative to the caster and its foundation system this was a management trap in that we virtually eliminated any contingency that we had to handle new projects from other clients the real blow to our project management came when nucor told us to take over all foundation work associated with the cold mill our first response was no we could not take on any additional work without jeopardizing the firm’s ability to respond to our other clients’ needs our negative response was not accepted by nucor thus our project management system was reduced to management by crises and to putting out the biggest fires first during the months of january february and march record overtime hours were set by company personnel the record overtime is indicative of one aspect of csdi management philosophy we do not staff up for a given project only to lay people off when the project is completed instead we ask for extra effort to deal with overcommitted situations currently our work is under construction and special effort is still required to answer field questions and process shop drawings in a timely manner as an additional activity we are making weekly visits to the site to resolve questions and clarify the drawings for the nucor field personnel and the contractors for csdi our work at crawfordsville has been significant in that it represented nucor’s continued confidence in our firm from a management point of view the nucor projects demanded a significant share of the firm’s resources and understanding and flexibility was needed from all csdi has answered nucor’s challenge proving it’s hard to say no to nucor                                dr james m fisher is vice president and principal of

constructions tr higgens lectureship award for his work relative to the design of industrial buildings an interview with keith j ascough preface by richard kimball pmj interviewer it was my pleasure to meet with and discuss the nucor flat rolled products steel project with keith ascough mr ascough who is now manager control systems marketing for the westinghouse automation division was the sales manager responsible within westinghouse at the time of this negotiation he was instrumental in developing the sales strategy which ultimately obtained this order as mr ascough indicates in the interview this order was of strategic importance to westinghouse in getting them in on the ground floor in the development of a new approach to making flat rolled steel products it also provided westinghouse the opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of its new technology of fully distributed digital control to a complete steel mill                                pmj in discussions with nucor and sms it was mentioned that westinghouse was involved in this project in the early stages how did this come about ascough with a lot of luck actually in the last quarter of  nucor was negotiating with electrical suppliers for another new mill in arkansas to produce wide flange beams during the course of these negotiations one of nucor’s senior electrical engineers visited westinghouse to familiarize himself with the new drive control and automation system that we had developed using wdpf™ our all digital fully distributed control system we did not appreciate at that time the importance of that visit and the effect it was to have upon our involvement with the flat rolled products plant in april of  we received a motor list for the rolling mills from sms and the pickle line from production machinery we went through our normal bid review process and made a positive bid decision having made this decision we set out to develop a bidding strategy to win this order we knew if we used the same approach as was appropriate for the major steel companies that we would not be successful from our knowledge of nucor we knew that they would want a plant which combined low cost with maximum performance in operation maintenance and quality keith j ascough is the manager control systems marketing for the automation division of westinghouse electric corporation in pittsburgh pennsylvania he holds a ba engineering mechanical degree from the university of sheffield in england he has been with westinghouse for three years prior to joining westinghouse he has held a variety of management and executive positions with wean united inc and been associated with the steel industry for over twentyfive years initially these objectives seemed mutually exclusive however we were determined to give it a try as we prepared our proposal we reviewed each cost contributing element and asked ourselves “can the plant run without this feature what is sacrificed if we omit it is there a more economical way to do this while still fulfilling its basic purpose” our strategy or objective was to fulfill nucor’s objectives efficiently economically completely and safely but without luxury having challenged ourselves with these questions at each stage we finished our technical proposals and submitted them to nucor each competing electrical supplier was given one day to review and explain their proposal and any features they wished to bring to nucor’s attention the nucor project review team consisted of three people from their darlington mill — the manager of rolling mill operations manager of maintenance and the same senior electrical engineer we had met the previous fall each of these people still maintained the responsibility for their permanent activities this was our first demonstration of the nucor culture in action for a project as large as this most companies would have had a task force or project team devoted exclusively to this assignment” during our session with nucor we were advised that our technical solutions and proposal were acceptable the next hurdle was delivery their schedule was extremely tight and we could not provide all of our equipment to meet the required delivery we sat down and developed a very detailed schedule which although it did not meet their requested schedule did commit to meet their installation and start up schedule as a result nucor advised that we had made the short list of acceptable suppliers following this we had two more days of technical refinement with nucor and sms to assure compatability between the mechanical and electrical supply and two days for finalization of price and commercial conditions nucor people are excellent buyers and pressed us hard until they were satisfied that they had the best combination of product quality price and commercial conditions we were then advised that we had obtained the order pmj westinghouse has been a leader in supplying electrical equipment to the steel industry for many years did this project have any special strategic importance to you ascough yes it did this was a very important and strategic order for westinghouse westinghouse as all other companies serving the steel industry had gone through some difficult years it was important to us to establish ourselves as the electrical supplier of this first revolutionary steel making process which has the potential to improve both the quality and to lower the cost of production we also saw this as a way to broaden our installed base as we have not traditionally been a supplier to the minimills market equally important was the opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of our own newly developed fully distributed digital control system to a whole steel plant also the first application in the steel industry of this new control technology was in spain the timing of this project fit in nicely with the completion of several of our spanish projects allowing us to redeploy our returning project personnel efficiently pmj what methods or procedures are you utilizing to manage this project ascough this is a large order for the automation division and includes various westinghouse products not produced by this division as well as a significant portion of equipment manufactured by other than westinghouse the scope of supply includes electrical distribution systems minicomputers main and auxiliary motors both ac and dc regulation control and automation equipment systems engineering spare parts and field services during installation and startup within westinghouse any large project of this nature is managed by a lead division which assumes full technical and contractual responsibility for the project throughout all stages until completion the drive control systems department of the automation division is taking the lead for this project simultaneously with obtaining the order from nucor a project manager was appointed to execute the contract the project manager jack wallace acts as the primary interface with nucor sms other contractors and suppliers and other westinghouse divisions assisting the project manager is a contract administrator whose responsibilities include interfacing with the accounting financial manufacturing purchasing traffic and other functional organizations causing essential documentation to happen in a timely manner in addition each major production unit has a senior westinghouse project engineer assigned for example the hot mill pickle line reversing cold mill etc these project engineers are responsible for among other things the complete technical design of the electrical drive and automation systems in that production unit and for coordinating systems common to more than one production unit with the fellow project engineers such common systems include the minicomputer system for schedule calculations adaptive learning and maintenance of engineering and production logs in addition the wdpf control system connects all of the production units to gather and provide production information setups control diagnostics and data due to the magnitude of this project the automation division has assigned to one of its sister divisions — the projects department of the commercial division — the responsibility for the procurement of all nonwestinghouse manufactured products the motors and the electric distribution system this includes the responsibility for design and procurement of the distribution system in this way we can take advantage of the multiple skills and disciplines that westinghouse has while ensuring that nucor still sees a single point of contact the project manager as the overall coordination point and responsible person for the performance of the contract pmj how is this approach working out ascough we believe it is working well shipments have already commenced and will be complete by the end of this year our projects department has been very active in assisting nucor in determining their actual electrical distribution needs nucor’s expertise is in operating plants not in designing them therefore we feel our assistance in this area has been beneficial to them the project to date has run smoothly and any problems which have arisen have been resolved without difficulty pmj what type of review process do you utilize and to what degree is westinghouse management involved ascough as i indicated this is a very important project to westinghouse we have frequent reviews with nucor sms lockwood greene and other contractors associated with this project we also have internal management reviews within westinghouse there is a lot of autonomy given to each division as well as each business unit the division and business unit managements are frequently updated on the status and receive monthly reports the project has been going so well that top management has been satisfied with the progress to date pmj what does this project mean to westinghouse’s future strategic direction ascough this is a milestone project for westinghouse it appears as if the fortunes of the steel industry are turning around and we are poised to take advantage of this turnaround we have a strong nucleus of drive systems engineering talent the most modern control system in the world high tech drive systems and we are positioned in the automation division a major growth segment of the corporation we hope to see several plants similar to this nucor plant being built in the united states and overseas in the future with the successful completion of this project the process technology and plant operating experience should place us in a very good position in this marketplace a project of this type is in many respects a partnership between the owner and their major suppliers this will provide all of us the opportunity to be learning the operating characteristics and performance of the new plant at the same time this is an advantage both to nucor and westinghouse our past experience can be used to suggest to nucor ways to optimize the operation and control of the process and of course it will benefit westinghouse by providing us new experience pmj thank you for your informative answers regarding this project and an insight into the strategic thinking of the westinghouse automation division john b wharton pe lockwood greene e steve helms pe lockwood greene engineering consultant’s role for the last several years lockwood greene has made a concerted effort to serve the metals industry with fullservice project management engineering and planning the company has been fortunate to work with numerous leading companies in the metals industry the nucor steel project represents one of the largest and most sophisticated projects of its kind lockwood greene has responsibility for installation engineering for all major mechanical and electrical systems development of general arrangement drawings coordination with all equipment suppliers and project management of these efforts for nucor project’s strategic role as the domestic steel industry continues its resurgence lockwood greene is providing project management and engineering services which allow the steel manufacturers to accomplish necessary capital expansion while maintaining lean corporate engineering staffs in essence lockwood greene serves as the company’s internal project manager and engineering staff the current project represents the first project for lockwood greene with nucor steel and therefore the first opportunity to establish a reputation with this steel industry leader as the first continuous strip caster in the united states the success of this project will be a benchmark for the steel industry as a whole lockwood greene is therefore a major stakeholder in the success of this leadingedge project project organization due to the fasttrack nature of the project lockwood greene is utilizing three of its five major engineering offices to accomplish simultaneous engineering efforts for three distinct areas of the plant the bulk of the engineering and project management is being provided by the oak ridge tennessee office including engineering of the hot rolling mill melt shop and outside utilities total plant general arrangements and overall project management the engineering of the cold rolling mill is being performed in the spartanburg south carolina office while engineering of the casting machine is being performed in dallas texas lockwood greene’s cad system and corporate computer network allows effective coordination of a multioffice project team to ensure uniformity of design coordination and effective communication management lockwood greene has implemented a tiered project management structure to oversee this project the oak ridge office has one senior project manager with the ultimate responsibility for management and coordination of the project within lockwood greene between lockwood greene and nucor and between lockwood greene and other project participants each of the three offices has a designated project engineer who manages and coordinates the efforts of that office and reports directly to the senior project manager in addition to the project engineers each office has one team leader for each engineering discipline who manages and coordinates the efforts of that discipline and reports directly to the project engineer the team leaders in the oak ridge office also act as the first line of communication for coordination of efforts among offices within one discipline in all cases the project engineers are informed of all communication and are always directly accessible to any member of the project team communications management with well over a dozen companies as major participants in this project communications management between lockwood greene and the other participants is of major importance to ensure information transfer to the most appropriate persons all lockwood greene project members are in direct contact with equipment suppliers other engineering companies contractors and nucor personnel as the need arises all information transferred by means of telephone calls or meetings are documented in reports or minutes and transmitted to nucor all participants in the information transfer and throughout lockwood greene the lockwood greene senior project manager has support from a project controls department for managing project communications the project controls department actually consists of separate project administration and document control groups project administration assists in maintaining all project accounting and progress track and reporting systems document control handles the distribution reproduction master record filing and processing of all communication flow whether incoming outgoing or interdepartmental project team success the goal of all projects is the successful operation of the enterprise to obtain this goal all project participants must maintain effective management of human resources costs communications and quality as all project participants work towards the same goal the spirit of cooperation is the primary key to the success of this project                                john wharton is a group leader in the electrical department of lockwood greene in oak
