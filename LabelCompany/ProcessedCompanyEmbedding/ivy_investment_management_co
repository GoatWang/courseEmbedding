results our name reflects our progressive product offerings and growing global presence as we continue to adapt to the needs of investors market perspectives how to strike the right balance in high yield bonds  strong  performance and a sharp rally in credit spreads have prompted some investors to take a cautious view of high yield bonds however we believe this asset class remains attractive as part of a fixed income allocation particularly as the us federal reserve looks to raise interest rates the key is to approach the asset class thoughtfully the market is changing the surprise election of donald trump was a game changer while many details of this new administration are still uncertain the general direction is clear the positives of progrowth tax cuts regulatory rollback and infrastructure spending have to be weighed against a deleterious impact on global trade monetary policy remains generally accommodative however a shift in the fed’s “dot plots” and more hawkish rhetoric from many federal open market committee fomc members could indicate a path to higher treasury rates that is not as far off as recently thought why consider high yield as the fed plans to embark on its next interest rate tightening cycle investors in traditional fixed income assets are bracing for a prolonged period of underperformance zerointerestrate policy over the last several years has left many core fixed income portfolios with little yield cushion to absorb rising benchmark rates duration risk for bellwether core benchmarks such as the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index has also drifted steadily higher the result is that portfolios overexposed to highly interestratesensitive segments such as us treasuries us agency bonds and mortgagebacked securities may be even more vulnerable to principal losses than they were during past rate hike cycles as cycle change risks change to help diversify portfolio duration risk and strengthen yield curve positioning investors may consider a high yield bond allocation credit spreads are still more than double those of investmentgrade corporates and mortgagebacked securities with far less interest rate sensitivity than either of these segments moreover earnings estimates among the high yield issuer base are indicating marked improvement in  as companies get a double benefit from the improving domestic economy and the potential boost of the domesticfocused fiscal policy of the new administration further high yield default rates should begin to fall aggressively in the second half of  to a more typical  –  range due to an improved backdrop for commodityrelated credits however solid fundamentals are largely reflected in valuations across all asset classes while default rates are forecasted to trend lower valuations leave little cushion to absorb periods of heightened volatility given the policy uncertainty related to the new trump administration a busy  election calendar in europe and the prospect of a more active fed some vigilance is warranted high yield bond spreads have tended to absorb most treasury increases performance when fiveyear us treasuries rose  bps or more in three months source jpmorgan as of  for illustrative purposes only we are not soliciting or recommending any action based on this material past performance is not indicative of future results any views represent the opinion of the manager and are subject to change high yield bonds have prevailed in past rate hike cycles to illustrate the impact of us treasury yield increases on highyield bonds consider how the asset class has performed during previous periods when fiveyear us treasury yields increased  basis points or more in three months we examined each of these occurrences over the past  years high yield bond spreads absorbed  –  of the us treasury yield increase with returns moderately affected during the period of interest rate volatility positive returns resumed as rate volatility typically abated over the subsequent threemonth period consider the fourth quarter of  when the yieldtomaturity on the fiveyear treasury note rose from  to  a difference of  basis points during this period high yield absorbed this treasury move as spreads rallied  basis points which provided for a total return of  higher rated high yield credits have delivered better riskadjusted returns source bloomberg barclays as of  past performance is not a guarantee of future results sharpe ratio a measure that indicates the average return minus the riskfree return divided by the standard deviation of return on an investment standard deviation a measure of the degree to which a fund’s return varies from its previous returns or from the average of all similar funds generally expressed as a percentage the larger the standard deviation the greater the likelihood and risk that a security’s performance will fluctuate from the average return the larger the standard deviation the greater the likelihood and risk that a security’s performance will fluctuate from the average return ratings shown are the middle ratings of moody’s fitch and sp combined as compiled by bloomberg barclays why manager style and size have become increasingly important as rates begin to normalize over the next several years we expect security selection and alpha to play a much greater role in high yield bond portfolio returns than sector rotation and beta the added gains and downside protection a skilled manager can deliver can be considerable in terms of capturing both opportunistic capital appreciation and greater compounding opportunities through consistently higher income generation to help assess an investment manager’s ability to deliver stable alpha and limit default loss investors can evaluate whether the investment process is disciplined and repeatable securing steady outperformance in high yield requires a consistent investment process that properly balances risk and return managers should have consistent track

reflects our progressive product offerings and growing global presence as we continue to adapt to the needs of investors market perspectives how to strike the right balance in high yield bonds  strong  performance and a sharp rally in credit spreads have prompted some investors to take a cautious view of high yield bonds however we believe this asset class remains attractive as part of a fixed income allocation particularly as the us federal reserve looks to raise interest rates the key is to approach the asset class thoughtfully the market is changing the surprise election of donald trump was a game changer while many details of this new administration are still uncertain the general direction is clear the positives of progrowth tax cuts regulatory rollback and infrastructure spending have to be weighed against a deleterious impact on global trade monetary policy remains generally accommodative however a shift in the fed’s “dot plots” and more hawkish rhetoric from many federal open market committee fomc members could indicate a path to higher treasury rates that is not as far off as recently thought why consider high yield as the fed plans to embark on its next interest rate tightening cycle investors in traditional fixed income assets are bracing for a prolonged period of underperformance zerointerestrate policy over the last several years has left many core fixed income portfolios with little yield cushion to absorb rising benchmark rates duration risk for bellwether core benchmarks such as the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index has also drifted steadily higher the result is that portfolios overexposed to highly interestratesensitive segments such as us treasuries us agency bonds and mortgagebacked securities may be even more vulnerable to principal losses than they were during past rate hike cycles as cycle change risks change to help diversify portfolio duration risk and strengthen yield curve positioning investors may consider a high yield bond allocation credit spreads are still more than double those of investmentgrade corporates and mortgagebacked securities with far less interest rate sensitivity than either of these segments moreover earnings estimates among the high yield issuer base are indicating marked improvement in  as companies get a double benefit from the improving domestic economy and the potential boost of the domesticfocused fiscal policy of the new administration further high yield default rates should begin to fall aggressively in the second half of  to a more typical  –  range due to an improved backdrop for commodityrelated credits however solid fundamentals are largely reflected in valuations across all asset classes while default rates are forecasted to trend lower valuations leave little cushion to absorb periods of heightened volatility given the policy uncertainty related to the new trump administration a busy  election calendar in europe and the prospect of a more active fed some vigilance is warranted high yield bond spreads have tended to absorb most treasury increases performance when fiveyear us treasuries rose  bps or more in three months source jpmorgan as of  for illustrative purposes only we are not soliciting or recommending any action based on this material past performance is not indicative of future results any views represent the opinion of the manager and are subject to change high yield bonds have prevailed in past rate hike cycles to illustrate the impact of us treasury yield increases on highyield bonds consider how the asset class has performed during previous periods when fiveyear us treasury yields increased  basis points or more in three months we examined each of these occurrences over the past  years high yield bond spreads absorbed  –  of the us treasury yield increase with returns moderately affected during the period of interest rate volatility positive returns resumed as rate volatility typically abated over the subsequent threemonth period consider the fourth quarter of  when the yieldtomaturity on the fiveyear treasury note rose from  to  a difference of  basis points during this period high yield absorbed this treasury move as spreads rallied  basis points which provided for a total return of  higher rated high yield credits have delivered better riskadjusted returns source bloomberg barclays as of  past performance is not a guarantee of future results sharpe ratio a measure that indicates the average return minus the riskfree return divided by the standard deviation of return on an investment standard deviation a measure of the degree to which a fund’s return varies from its previous returns or from the average of all similar funds generally expressed as a percentage the larger the standard deviation the greater the likelihood and risk that a security’s performance will fluctuate from the average return the larger the standard deviation the greater the likelihood and risk that a security’s performance will fluctuate from the average return ratings shown are the middle ratings of moody’s fitch and sp combined as compiled by bloomberg barclays why manager style and size have become increasingly important as rates begin to normalize over the next several years we expect security selection and alpha to play a much greater role in high yield bond portfolio returns than sector rotation and beta the added gains and downside protection a skilled manager can deliver can be considerable in terms of capturing both opportunistic capital appreciation and greater compounding opportunities through consistently higher income generation to help assess an investment manager’s ability to deliver stable alpha and limit default loss investors can evaluate whether the investment process is disciplined and repeatable securing steady outperformance in high yield requires a consistent investment process that properly balances risk and return managers should have consistent track

researchers and marketers have spent significant time and resources dissecting the millennial mindset but the generational limelight is beginning to shift as members of the youngest generation generation edge start trickling into the workplace meet generation edge also known as generation z born after  they are true digital natives and look to be just as — if not more — influential than their millennial predecessors as members of this upandcoming generation enter their formative years explore what makes them unique their parents while millennials were mostly raised by idealistic boomer parents during the selfesteem movement many edgers are parented by a very different generation — generation x generation x came of age during the emergence of hour media and tabloid journalism in adulthood xers were in the wrong place at the wrong time they entered the job market as the dotcom bubble burst and purchased houses just before the great recession gen xers have been through a lot and are determined to make sure their kids are better off xers are encouraging independent thinking and competition in their edger children consequently edgers are showing themselves to be a realistic and practical generation gen edge influencers thus far if you think millennials are techsavvy… well just wait edgers are vastly more adept in the digital world while millennials grew up with clunky gaming systems and pixelated graphics most edgers can’t recall a time without touchscreens and motionsensing gaming millennials remember dialup internet edgers grew up with ubiquitous wifi have high expectations around technology and will expect the world to keep up technology however is only the beginning of the edger story for such a young generation gen edgers have seen their fair share of tragedy they watched as the country was rocked by terrorism they worried as their parents fought to keep their homes during the great recession they’ve developed a tough shell to protect themselves from cyberbullying social media is teaching them that they can’t trust politicians or even law enforcement and the first election in which gen edgers were eligible to vote clinton v trump — a race that will go down in history as one of the most contentious and divisive elections ever gen edgers witnessed some truly dire events but have also looked on as we’ve made some inspiring changes in the fabric of our culture they’ve watched as barack obama became the first africanamerican president seen samesex marriage legalized and have followed along if not participated as the fight for women’s rights marches on all of which are astonishing changes from the status quo of previous generations the edger persona dollars and cents — understandably  of edgers are concerned about college debt but instead of worrying about it they’re saving for it edgers prefer to save money rather than spend it immediately while millennials try to be careful with their money edgers take frugality even further they care about more than just the price tag and a coupon they want to get the best value for their money they want to know about additional services that might come with their purchases these qualities at such a young age hint to a financiallyconscious generation which isn’t altogether surprising considering the financial hardships their xer parents survived since xers didn’t experience the american dream like boomers did xer parents are giving their children the practical and savvy tools to be successful in an unfair world adulting as teens — while the oldest edgers have graduated college this is mostly a teenage generation — albeit one that’s already thinking a lot about their lives as adults sixtyone percent of edgers have already begun saving for their future and many of today’s students are concerned about finding a job once they graduate college still they remain optimistic about their careers  aspire to be in their dream job in  years these highreaching edgers want to dive into opportunities for career growth as soon as possible gen edgers expect professional development in their first jobs if companies play their cards right they can avoid the jobhopping phenomenon so prevalent among millennials by offering edgers continual training and providing ample professional development these types of engagement will be important for retaining edgers allknowing — edgers have grown up with unlimited instantaneous access to information they expect to have a constant connection to their peers and families across multiple platforms they can and will factcheck anything — and they’re more than willing to research companies and people they already know whether or not a new line of skincare products is truly “all natural” they’re proud of their favorite clothing brand’s nonprofit engagements and they read all about prominent business scandals while this can be intimidating don’t let it be for an edger it’s a breath of fresh air when a company has easilyaccessible information that isn’t trying to hide anythingwhat this might mean for the workforce many gen edgers are still in their formative years but we can already guess some of the traits they might bring with them to the workplace they are technologically fluent selfreliant and pragmatic they’ll be the first to master a new web technology and start seamlessly integrating it into their daily routines… but probably won’t want to be viewed as the new inhouse it and digital specialists if it’s not in their job description having picked up a thing or two from their xer parents edgers will lean more towards independence and selfreliance than millennials they won’t jump at opportunities to collaborate because they’ll be too busy worrying about getting their work done when they do collaborate they’ll rely on virtual tools that don’t require being in the same room as their colleagues gen edgers will also be practical about goals and limitations and determined to see projects through to completion in the most efficient way possible they’ll try to stay on top of their workloads through multitasking and smart use of processes and technology and they’ll bring a realistic and disciplined perspective to the workforce while generation edgers are still defining their generational identity you can plan on seeing some stark differences to millennials their entry to the working world will stir up the generational workplace and might cause some clashes at times with a millennialdominated environment through all this speculation one thing remains unarguably true — gen edge will usher in a whole new set of skills values and perspectives they’ll add a fresh dollop of generational diversity and present a challenge but also an opportunity to those who are tuned in for the

many edgers are parented by a very different generation — generation x generation x came of age during the emergence of hour media and tabloid journalism in adulthood xers were in the wrong place at the wrong time they entered the job market as the dotcom bubble burst and purchased houses just before the great recession gen xers have been through a lot and are determined to make sure their kids are better off xers are encouraging independent thinking and competition in their edger children consequently edgers are showing themselves to be a realistic and practical generation gen edge influencers thus far if you think millennials are techsavvy… well just wait edgers are vastly more adept in the digital world while millennials grew up with clunky gaming systems and pixelated graphics most edgers can’t recall a time without touchscreens and motionsensing gaming millennials remember dialup internet edgers grew up with ubiquitous wifi have high expectations around technology and will expect the world to keep up technology however is only the beginning of the edger story for such a young generation gen edgers have seen their fair share of tragedy they watched as the country was rocked by terrorism they worried as their parents fought to keep their homes during the great recession they’ve developed a tough shell to protect themselves from cyberbullying social media is teaching them that they can’t trust politicians or even law enforcement and the first election in which gen edgers were eligible to vote clinton v trump — a race that will go down in history as one of the most contentious and divisive elections ever gen edgers witnessed some truly dire events but have also looked on as we’ve made some inspiring changes in the fabric of our culture they’ve watched as barack obama became the first africanamerican president seen samesex marriage legalized and have followed along if not participated as the fight for women’s rights marches on all of which are astonishing changes from the status quo of previous generations the edger persona dollars and cents — understandably  of edgers are concerned about college debt but instead of worrying about it they’re saving for it edgers prefer to save money rather than spend it immediately while millennials try to be careful with their money edgers take frugality even further they care about more than just the price tag and a coupon they want to get the best value for their money they want to know about additional services that might come with their purchases these qualities at such a young age hint to a financiallyconscious generation which isn’t altogether surprising considering the financial hardships their xer parents survived since xers didn’t experience the american dream like boomers did xer parents are giving their children the practical and savvy tools to be successful in an unfair world adulting as teens — while the oldest edgers have graduated college this is mostly a teenage generation — albeit one that’s already thinking a lot about their lives as adults sixtyone percent of edgers have already begun saving for their future and many of today’s students are concerned about finding a job once they graduate college still they remain optimistic about their careers  aspire to be in their dream job in  years these highreaching edgers want to dive into opportunities for career growth as soon as possible gen edgers expect professional development in their first jobs if companies play their cards right they can avoid the jobhopping phenomenon so prevalent among millennials by offering edgers continual training and providing ample professional development these types of engagement will be important for retaining edgers allknowing — edgers have grown up with unlimited instantaneous access to information they expect to have a constant connection to their peers and families across multiple platforms they can and will factcheck anything — and they’re more than willing to research companies and people they already know whether or not a new line of skincare products is truly “all natural” they’re proud of their favorite clothing brand’s nonprofit engagements and they read all about prominent business scandals while this can be intimidating don’t let it be for an edger it’s a breath of fresh air when a company has easilyaccessible information that isn’t trying to hide anythingwhat this might mean for the workforce many gen edgers are still in their formative years but we can already guess some of the traits they might bring with them to the workplace they are technologically fluent selfreliant and pragmatic they’ll be the first to master a new web technology and start seamlessly integrating it into their daily routines… but probably won’t want to be viewed as the new inhouse it and digital specialists if it’s not in their job description having picked up a thing or two from their xer parents edgers will lean more towards independence and selfreliance than millennials they won’t jump at opportunities to collaborate because they’ll be too busy worrying about getting their work done when they do collaborate they’ll rely on virtual tools that don’t require being in the same room as their colleagues gen edgers will also be practical about goals and limitations and determined to see projects through to completion in the most efficient way possible they’ll try to stay on top of their workloads through multitasking and smart use of processes and technology and they’ll bring a realistic and disciplined perspective to the workforce while generation edgers are still defining their generational identity you can plan on seeing some stark differences to millennials their entry to the working world will stir up the generational workplace and might cause some clashes at times with a millennialdominated environment through all this speculation one thing remains unarguably true — gen edge will usher in a whole new set of skills values and perspectives they’ll add a fresh dollop of generational diversity and present a challenge but also an opportunity to those who are tuned in for the changes on the horizon

investments we stand for a legacy of expertise focused on delivering strong longterm results our name reflects our progressive product offerings and growing global presence as we continue to adapt to the needs of investors market perspectives fallen angels offer opportunity in credit market  in most credit cycles the market hits a point when credit rating downgrades far exceed upgrades this ratings migration process can significantly impact the valuations of securities particularly when credits are downgraded from a rating of investment grade to high yield companies that go through such a downgrade often are referred to as fallen angels the price dislocation that occurs as companies and sectors transition from investment grade to high yield can present significant opportunity for experienced investors in what is termed a crossover market crossover market opportunity there are several reasons the crossover market and fallen angels have offered investors willing to accept the additional risks the potential for excess returns but the forced selling that often results from these credit downgrades is the primary driver with fallen angels many investment managers who focus on investment grade securities have mandates with limits based on credit ratings in general the higher the credit rating the larger the position size can be in a specific credit when a credit gets downgraded to high yield a manager invested in that security often must reduce the position to get within the mandate’s limits — and that means forced selling in addition the investment grade market is approximately five times larger than the high yield market forced selling thus often occurs into the much smaller market and the resulting price often adjusts lower as the ratings transition happens fallen angels also tend to be much larger companies with more debt outstanding when compared to companies rated high yield which adds to the transition challenges from a larger to a smaller market in general the more downgrades that occur over a short period of time the more attractive the potential opportunities become on a riskreward basis market factors at work now in latter  and early  commoditybased sectors particularly energy and metals experienced significant pressure downward in both the equity and debt markets as a result many commoditybased companies were downgraded in q this resulted in the majority of the energy and metals sectors in both investmentgrade and high yield markets experiencing extreme price volatility this downward pressure on bond prices was exaggerated by the forced selling that occurred as many former investmentgrade companies were downgraded to high yield fallen angels to illustrate the price volatility that occurred during this time the average price of high yield bonds in the energy sector according to bloomberg barclay indexes for the investmentgrade and high yield categories was  at the end of february  the investmentgrade market experienced similar pain with average price on bonds in the energy sector at  per the bloomberg barclays indexes one year late at february  monthend the same average prices were at  and  in the bloomberg barclays high yield and bloomberg barclays investment grade indexes respectively it is important to note that these prices were average prices for the indexes many individual names in the crossover market experienced more severe pricing action total return for the high yield energy sector was  and investment grade was  over the past  months ending february  attractive riskreward opportunities similar to what occurred in the crossover energy sector over the past year present themselves in various sectors and individual names over the course of credit cycles in times when riskreward opportunities are limited it is generally a prudent strategy to invest in the higher credit quality bbb rated credits parts of the crossover market in other times as was the case in early  it definitely paid to be more aggressive historical returns offer a guide although the crossover market is not widely discussed as a distinct market it has been recognized with its own returns and statistics for more than  years the total return history of the crossover market compares favorably to both higher and lowerquality credit during that time for example the annualized return for the crossover market was  in  compared with  for high yield and  for investment grade in  the last time crossover downgrades were material relative to upgrades the annualized return was  although it may be unrealistic to expect a repeat of ’s total return we think the magnitude of expected downgrades in  is comparable on a riskadjusted return basis for the period  using the sharpe ratio the crossover result of  was slightly less than high yield at  but exceeded investment grade at  low correlation with interest rate moves one way to examine the relationship between securities or among factors is through “correlation” — a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other a correlation of  indicates the securities moved in lockstep through a specific time period securities in the crossover market historically have not been highly correlated to interest rate changes as typically has been the case with investment grade credit in fact the correlation between us treasuries and crossovers is only  since  compared with  for investment grade based on this historical relationship we believe crossovers are not likely to be materially affected as interest rates rise in each of the eight years since the onset of the global financial crisis crossovers have not had a single year in which they underperformed both investment grade and high yield based on returns in the bloomberg barclays indexes pursuing the potential now in our view investments in the crossover market offer the potential for higher riskadjusted returns versus the high yield market without the high correlation to interest rate changes of investment grade credit that’s an important consideration in the current environment since the us federal reserve has begun moves taking interest rates higher history also shows that the crossover market has been most attractive at the end of a credit cycle when rating dislocations were at their peak for these reasons we think  offers a potential opportunity in the crossover credit market source bloomberg barclays crossover returns based on bofa merrill lynch us diversified crossover corporate index which represents us dollardenominated bbb

offerings and growing global presence as we continue to adapt to the needs of investors market perspectives fallen angels offer opportunity in credit market  in most credit cycles the market hits a point when credit rating downgrades far exceed upgrades this ratings migration process can significantly impact the valuations of securities particularly when credits are downgraded from a rating of investment grade to high yield companies that go through such a downgrade often are referred to as fallen angels the price dislocation that occurs as companies and sectors transition from investment grade to high yield can present significant opportunity for experienced investors in what is termed a crossover market crossover market opportunity there are several reasons the crossover market and fallen angels have offered investors willing to accept the additional risks the potential for excess returns but the forced selling that often results from these credit downgrades is the primary driver with fallen angels many investment managers who focus on investment grade securities have mandates with limits based on credit ratings in general the higher the credit rating the larger the position size can be in a specific credit when a credit gets downgraded to high yield a manager invested in that security often must reduce the position to get within the mandate’s limits — and that means forced selling in addition the investment grade market is approximately five times larger than the high yield market forced selling thus often occurs into the much smaller market and the resulting price often adjusts lower as the ratings transition happens fallen angels also tend to be much larger companies with more debt outstanding when compared to companies rated high yield which adds to the transition challenges from a larger to a smaller market in general the more downgrades that occur over a short period of time the more attractive the potential opportunities become on a riskreward basis market factors at work now in latter  and early  commoditybased sectors particularly energy and metals experienced significant pressure downward in both the equity and debt markets as a result many commoditybased companies were downgraded in q this resulted in the majority of the energy and metals sectors in both investmentgrade and high yield markets experiencing extreme price volatility this downward pressure on bond prices was exaggerated by the forced selling that occurred as many former investmentgrade companies were downgraded to high yield fallen angels to illustrate the price volatility that occurred during this time the average price of high yield bonds in the energy sector according to bloomberg barclay indexes for the investmentgrade and high yield categories was  at the end of february  the investmentgrade market experienced similar pain with average price on bonds in the energy sector at  per the bloomberg barclays indexes one year late at february  monthend the same average prices were at  and  in the bloomberg barclays high yield and bloomberg barclays investment grade indexes respectively it is important to note that these prices were average prices for the indexes many individual names in the crossover market experienced more severe pricing action total return for the high yield energy sector was  and investment grade was  over the past  months ending february  attractive riskreward opportunities similar to what occurred in the crossover energy sector over the past year present themselves in various sectors and individual names over the course of credit cycles in times when riskreward opportunities are limited it is generally a prudent strategy to invest in the higher credit quality bbb rated credits parts of the crossover market in other times as was the case in early  it definitely paid to be more aggressive historical returns offer a guide although the crossover market is not widely discussed as a distinct market it has been recognized with its own returns and statistics for more than  years the total return history of the crossover market compares favorably to both higher and lowerquality credit during that time for example the annualized return for the crossover market was  in  compared with  for high yield and  for investment grade in  the last time crossover downgrades were material relative to upgrades the annualized return was  although it may be unrealistic to expect a repeat of ’s total return we think the magnitude of expected downgrades in  is comparable on a riskadjusted return basis for the period  using the sharpe ratio the crossover result of  was slightly less than high yield at  but exceeded investment grade at  low correlation with interest rate moves one way to examine the relationship between securities or among factors is through “correlation” — a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other a correlation of  indicates the securities moved in lockstep through a specific time period securities in the crossover market historically have not been highly correlated to interest rate changes as typically has been the case with investment grade credit in fact the correlation between us treasuries and crossovers is only  since  compared with  for investment grade based on this historical relationship we believe crossovers are not likely to be materially affected as interest rates rise in each of the eight years since the onset of the global financial crisis crossovers have not had a single year in which they underperformed both investment grade and high yield based on returns in the bloomberg barclays indexes pursuing the potential now in our view investments in the crossover market offer the potential for higher riskadjusted returns versus the high yield market without the high correlation to interest rate changes of investment grade credit that’s an important consideration in the current environment since the us federal reserve has begun moves taking interest rates higher history also shows that the crossover market has been most attractive at the end of a credit cycle when rating dislocations were at their peak for these reasons we think  offers a potential opportunity in the crossover credit market source bloomberg barclays crossover returns based on bofa merrill lynch us diversified crossover corporate index which

reveals a funds investment style for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  years unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time month trailing

capture ratio are  year statistics alpha is a measure of a funds actual returns and expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta beta reflects the sensitivity of the funds return to fluctuations in the market index rsquared indicates how much of a funds fluctuations were attributable to movements in the funds benchmark standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a funds returns are sharpe ratio is a measure of a funds riskadjusted performance capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return upside capture or negative return downside capture the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance and does not include the effects of sales charges the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear

course is on active management” said thomas w butch ceo of ivy distributors inc “proshares has long been known as a leader within the etf space and we are pleased to partner with them”three of the five funds share their strategies with existing proshares etfs while it has become common to see mutual funds migrated to the etf wrapper it is far more unusual to see the reverse—successful etf strategies made available as mutual funds for investors in retirement plans or advisory platforms that typically are limited to mutual funds these ivy proshares funds offer access to innovative index strategies from one of the industry’s premier providers of etfs“with their strong reputation and substantial distribution network ivy investments is a natural partner to help us introduce these innovative strategies to mutual fund investors for the first time” said michael l sapir cofounder and ceo of proshare advisors llc the advisor to proshares“we chose these five categories precisely because they complement our active product lineup and they are differentiated styles outside of what we believe are more commoditized passive asset classes commonly available elsewhere” butch added “for example the ivy proshares sp  bond index fund tracking bonds of its index’s companies will be the first mutual fund with this strategy to this point”following is a snapshot of the lineup product
