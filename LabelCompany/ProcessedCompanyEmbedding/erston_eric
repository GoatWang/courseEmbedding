leader in rapid’s sales organization eric erston is rapids senior vice president of sales for the americas region he has extensive experience in a variety of sales roles including leading gotomarket functions for mergers and acquisitions prior to joining rapid eric served as senior vice president of global sales at enernoc from  to  he held senior sales leadership positions at rsa most recently he was hailed as global vp of go to market identity and risk management hes sold enterprise security solutions to companies of all sizes and is a great example of someone whose sales career has grown from individual contributor roles to diverse leadership experience heres his story on how he got started why hes excited about rapid and what advice he has for those starting out in sales let’s start with the basics did you always know you wanted a career in sales how’d you start down this pathi knew i wanted to be selling things and by age  i was building and selling custom bmx bikes from there it took an undergrad degree in accounting to help me realize that wasn’t the path for me i fell into sales shortly after college and have loved it ever since being a sales guy during the first dot com bubble in  was an amazingly fun ride and solidified my love for the discipline  boston is full of hot exciting cybersecurity companies why rapidwhen choosing a company to work for its important to look at  major elementsproduct is the product or solution set totally sound is it marketleadingmarket are you marketconstrained is the product market fit correctpeople are the people key differentiators for the company in the market rapid was a big yes in all these areas i enjoy security and it operations and i wanted to be with a company that delivers foundational elements of most end users’ programs as opposed to “nice to haves” i didnt want to go to the company with the next “shiny” object i wanted to be with a company with a track record of delivering value to customers and driving growth from solutions that exist today not roadmap promises the security and it operations fields are full of technology but short on value delivered by vendors so there’s huge opportunity for a company like rapid to fill that valueprovider hole plus security has become such an important area for both the public and private sectors in addition to being exciting its something you can really believe in and connect with what do you think the most exciting opportunity is for rapid right nowim hardpressed to pick just one the two things that really excite me are the rapid insight platform and our pact partner program the insight platform is the first of its kind in security a collection of products that deliver value individually but are also engineered together in a clouddelivered solution that provides both efficiency and effectiveness to customers—thats a sales persons dream and rapids pact partner program fires me up because its different its built from the ground up with end users and partners at the forefront so its all about value for the constituents ive never seen a program that is designed to do anything except push the vendors product but pact is unique and its going to bring value to the whole ecosystem working with partners is a winwin when you engage with them the way we do what have been some of your biggest challenges since you started at rapid in januaryfortunately the biggest challenge we face is the one all growth companies face which is how to keep the best of what got us here while making needed changes so we get to where we want to beall without messing things up we have an amazingly effective gotomarket engine at rapid and weve pioneered what i refer to as modern sellers but we need to continuously develop and expand our capabilities and approach we pride ourselves on delivering high value to our ecosystem and we do it by offering a unique sales model and a unique set of solutions to maximize our impact we work hard to start with the right talent and then invest heavily in enablement to ensure were focused on outcomes for our customers and partners and not just more sales its a challenge but the rewards are worth it and frankly its the only way to be great in todays market what’s it like to be on the sales floor at rapidit’s sort of like watching the stanley cup playoffs just when you think the game cant get any faster and the competition can’t get any more intense the players find a way to amp it up we have an amazing group of talented professionals and the teamwork and camaraderie are unparalleled im continuously impressed by the collaboration knowledge sharing and genuine excitement that our people show each other when someone is successful the feeling spreads across the floor and everyone celebrates its a really cool phenomenon  what’s the hardest lesson you’ve learned during your time in saleseven when you think youre on top of your game you can make some really dumb mistakes—and they can be costly sometimes mistakes are the result of being sloppy or shortcutting but sometimes they come from running too fast and not sticking to the process a good buddy of mine always says the process will never let you down and hes right process might not tell you what you want to hear but it wont let you down and of course we can avoid nonstop pain by adhering to the fundamental rule surround yourself with great people what’s the best piece of advice you’d give to someone looking to start a career in salesfind a good mentor—someone who’s seen different markets and enjoyed meaningful success but also lived through down times technology sales has changed a lot thats why we focus so intently on finding and developing modern sellers perspective from someone with experience can be invaluable for a young sales professional last question what’s your favorite sports teamim a pretty big bruins fan but i have to admit not much beats the  red wings and the early s oilers in my

emc first acquired archer they were bringing in for all intents and purposes a startup company so taking those functions and migrating them over to take advantage of the gotomarket capabilities that the big machine had you needed someone to look after all of them gotomarket includes strategic alliances partner programs what would be considered corporate marketing some of the product marketing capabilities and then the sales and sales engineering capabilities over time we’ve functionalized a lot of that so today it’s closer to sales than anything else but if you are a salesdriven culture you are handandglove with the marketing teams product marketing teams and everything that goes on from a customer and messaging perspective how do you define the function of gotomarket gotomarket starts as soon as the desire for revenue materializes at that point it’s really around the external message and then it’s around the delivery of capabilities to support that message and then it’s around delivery vehicles for that message the delivery of a capability means we have a product a solution or a service – something that we are going to sell delivery vehicles are the channels to which you take that to market through it could be an advisory partner it could be traditional technology reseller it could be a systems integrator or it could be your sales force or a partner’s sales force all those pieces need to work together a gotomarket capability can’t function on any one of these alone you’ve got to have a way to seed the market with your vision the place you want the market to believe that its going that’s the topdown messaging you also need bottomsup messaging because people don’t buy vision for the most part they buy solutions to immediate problems so those problems have to become reality and they become reality because you are able to implement them where does gotomarket sit in the product innovation process is it something that leads product development or is it something that takes place after innovation has already happened i think that it is both but there is a clear role for gotomarket to drive innovation engineers and product managers should be building solutions that solve customer needs those needs get brought in through some of the gotomarket functions like sales or product marketing that front interface has to assess what the market needs are where the gaps are and where the opportunities are there has to be a component of your offering that stretches the maturity level of your existing customer base and part of it has to be right on the money of “this is the pain that people are solving today” – and that’s where the real excellence of the solution has to be firing on all cylinders you have to be able to solve that problem today do you have an example of a time when new product innovations took place specifically because of feedback from gotomarket the offering that rsa has just launched around security analytics was a clear response to market demand every single customer that manages security operations has a hard time implementing all the technology they have customers were saying “i’ve got all these pieces and parts i don’t really get value out of all of them” we went back to the product team and said “this is the problem – how do we solve it” that led to our latest product release as a result you end up with a product that solves a pain point but it is also visionary for some folks – it’s inspirational and gives them an organizational target to drive to how do you work with other functional teams from a daytoday perspective to accomplish gtm objectives very carefully and closely if you’re not talking to them on a regular basis then you are going to be disconnected the balance is to get the sales and product marketing functions both aligned to the field salespeople talk to customers all the time but they can’t be the only ones talking to customers you need the product marketing and product management guys all talking to customers and hearing where the pains are what’s working well what’s not and understanding what the adjacencies are the market you are playing in eric erston is vp
