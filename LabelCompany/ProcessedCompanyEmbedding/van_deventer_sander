plans and partnering strategy  9 summary transcript participants company sander van deventer general partner at forbion capital former  interim ceo of dezima pharmapartners talks to fintan walton about the game changing pharma and biotech companies forbion is investing in dezima pharma a recent investment is discussed at length investment strategy of forbion capital partnerfintan walton hello and welcome to pharmatelevision news review here at bioeurope spring in barcelona in 3 on this show i have sander van deventer who is general partner at forbion capital welcome sander van deventer yes thank you very much fintan walton sander you are a as i said a general partner at forbion capital but you are also interim ceo of a company called dezima  now dezima is a company we will come on to the detail of that but it describes the types of companies you are investing in so just from forbion capital point of view what sort of companies do you invest in what are you looking for and what you like about the companies you have identified sander van deventer yes i think in general our strategy has been to invest in companies that really are game changers in their respective therapeutic areas so that includes novel class of small molecules but also gene therapy cell therapy approaches and our strategy really is to bring it you know some times from really early on all the way to market registration such as weve done for example with uniqure where we really started gene therapy and then brought it all the way to a product which is now approved in europe and the other thing is that we really want to cater unmet medical needs fintan walton right and game changers disruptive technologies have got big prizes to them but they have high risk to them as well so how do you balance that risk particularly if you are going to back the products all the way through into clinic sander van deventer yes of course we spread risk in our portfolio so dezima pharma which is a small molecule for dyslipidemia really falls in a different category than say an early investment in a gene therapy company on the other hand i think what we have specialized in this to be really good at clinical development regulatory strategy and not the least also manufacturing buying compound from mitsubishi tanbe and formation of dezima pharmafintan walton okay so lets look at dezima because thats an interesting story in its own right first of all just give us a little bit of the history to that how do that come about and why did you get in the game so early sander van deventer yes so we do have a good relationship with a couple of our exclusive advisors including john kastelein whom i know quite well because together we were the we founded uniqure together fintan walton okay sander van deventer and so he is our advisor and he brings us quite a lot of deals and so john actually knew that there was this compound in japan which had been developed by mitsubishi tanbe but they discontinued development and we knew actually from the characteristics of the drug and looking at it in more detail actually it became quite apparent that this was a real good one in that particular class of drugs which are cetp inhibitors so starting from there actually we founded a company around it the company actually opened for additional inlicensing and we formed the management ourselves we got great help from one of our other portfolio company xention part of their development team the cmo and the vp clinical development are from xention and so with a lot of support from forbion and one of our portfolio companies we really brought this product into a company which hit the floor running i would say fintan walton right but youve also just raised some money recently through series a sander van deventer we did yes we actually prefinanced the company with together with a local dutch fund called biogeneration ventures but now we have a new investor coming in new science ventures very well known to us we have couple of joint investments very good investor bringing in significant amount of additional money including money from ourselves which will fully fund the company all the way through phase iib so we also got a  million soft loan called innovation credit from the dutch government so together that fully finances this company all the way through phase iib fintan walton i suppose when a company discontinues a product like mitsubishi tanbe does you have to ask questions i am sure you did so what answers did they give to your questions that enabled you to say yes this may be still a winner sander van deventer well of course that is a question you would have to ask mitsubishi and not to me we believe its a winner just basically looking at the data which include clinical data and i think there is more corporate strategy reasons for them to discontinue development fintan walton so there is nothing there from a clinical perspective or from a technical perspective that worried you sander van deventer no not at all fintan walton obviously otherwise you wouldnt have taken it sander van deventer weve done very extensive due diligence and i think the people we work with know this cetp space in and out and so yes we are really confident that we have a good product here fintan walton and is there a still a collaboration with mitsubishi tanbe pharmadeals id   on this sander van deventer yes we are very happy with the collaboration with mitsubishi and i think things are moving quite rapidly forward i mean and its only for this reason that we will be able to do start a phase ii study within just a couple of months from now fintan walton right so obviously they carried out a lot of clinical knowledge about this particular product sander van deventer they did they did a phase i single dose and multiple ascending dose studies in europe theyve done fantastic work on the drug itself on formulation and theyve provided us with a really good preclinical package development of lead molecule in dyslipidemia spacefintan walton right so lets look at the this lead molecule because i mean obviously its in a very interesting space dyslipidemia is important obviously it fits within the same field as cholesterollowering drugs so what is it about your molecule that and its approach that put its in a superior position to say regular statinsander van deventer yes so statin lower ldl cholesterol and clearly are effective in doing that when it comes to clinical endpoints but despite statin treatment quite a lot of patients with dyslipidemia still have coronary events for example if you had a first coronary event even with statin treating you have a  chance of getting another one within twoyears time so there is room for improvement the problem is if you increase the dose of statin then you do see more a cholesterol lowering but you also run in to other problems such as for example increased type  diabetes incidence and some statin actually decrease hdl cholesterol at higher dosages so just increasing the dose of the statin doesnt work you see cetp inhibitors have a quite a different mechanism they mediate there or they effect of shuttling of cholesterol from hdl to ldl particles in exchange for triglycerides and by doing that they both increase hdl cholesterol and lower ldl cholesterol and so that in itself is an interesting mechanism and they do it on top of statinsfintan walton okay sander van deventer and so if you combined cetp inhibitors with statin then you could get to more for example ldl cholesterol lowering while you avoid actually the diabetes risk in fact in one of the first studies with a cetp inhibitor the one that was initially developed by pfizer that even that came very nicely out of the trial how does dezima pharma compete against other cetp inhibitorsfintan walton alright so how do you compete against other cetp inhibitorssander van deventer so the cetp inhibitors actually all are molecules from different classes and they have very different effects on ldl cholesterol and hdl cholesterol for example the dalcetrapib drug a roches product that failed only increased the hdl cholesterol and we believe that definitely is not sufficient for an effective clinical endpoints we strongly believe you need to decrease ldl cholesterol and our product actually is the best in class in that respect in both respects actually increasing hdl but also in decreasing ldl cholesterol and then there are some other proatherogenic particles lipoproteins like a particle called lipoproteinlittle a which is very atherogenic and its not effected by any drug basically in a significant effect so we do have a very pronounced effect on that proatherogenic particles also it really has differentiated itself from other statins and cetp inhibitorsfintan walton right and what is it about your molecule that its structure and so forth that makes it distinctive sander van deventer well its a completely different class and we do know something about other cetp inhibitors that is where they actually bind to cetp and in what respect they effect the shuttling and clearly our molecule binds in the lipid bearing pockets and it is probably fold more or even more than fold more potent than the other competitors future plans and partnering strategyfintan walton okay so obviously but ive got to point out you are the interim ceo so presumably you are looking for a new ceo for that good luck with that but there just in terms of taking the product forward you mentioned that often you will take drugs all the way through into clinic and even to market in this case you are going to do that sander van deventer well in this case its going to be a little different fintan walton of course sander van deventer the point of course is that we know that phase iii clinical development for this type of product is large pharma territory and the clinical trials that are being designed by lilly and merck that range from depending on how you do it from  to  patients and that definitely will not be in our in what we will do but we do believe that if we have a very strong phase iib program that we will be able to partner this product because it falls in an unmet medical need area and we are pretty sure that large pharma would be interested in a product like that fintan walton right obviously it retains its profile that you assume it has at the moment so thats a partnering program you also mentioned that for dezima you were looking for other products you are interested in licensing or identifying other alliance could you give us some sort of feel for what that would be sander van deventer well those would be products in the same area that is for treatment of dyslipidemia and that could be in various classes there is squalene synthase inhibitors there are oral products lipid analogs that modify lipid profiles et cetera et cetera and as a matter of fact we see a lot of these opportunities coming by fintan walton sure and then obviously for a company like that you are looking for an exit at some point sander van deventer we do for all our portfolio companies we look for an exit fintan walton i know its a leading question but i suppose this sort of company you probably wouldnt want to ipo but you may want somebody to buy sander van deventer yes sure i dont think it does make a lot of sense to ipo a company like this i mean its definitely going to be a partnership and a trade sale some point in time fintan walton okay and sanders so just in the end just to finalize this you are here at this conference are you looking for partners already sander van deventer we do and actually i mean there is a quite lot of interest in this product already so yes fintan walton sanders thank you very much indeed for coming on the show sander van deventer well thank you fintan walton dr fintan walton is the founder and ceo of pharmaventures  after
