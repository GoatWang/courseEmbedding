founded in  however its predecessor firms date back to  when bosworth todd founded the toddboston company in  responding to changing markets and frustration with the static nature of standard value practices the value products adopted its unique methodology using intrinsic value to identify a stocks true underlying value today with nearly  years of experience with the intrinsic value methodology todd asset management continues to believe priceintrinsic value piv is still the most effective method for determining the relative attractiveness of one stock versus another regardless of economic sector piv provides the foundation for five large cap strategies domestic large cap intrinsic value domestic intrinsic value opportunity international intrinsic value global intrinsic value equity income international intrinsic value opportunity combining piv with a fundamentalsbased proprietary multifactor ranking model piv is the foundation for each of our five strategies but the process has evolved to include a fundamentalsbased proprietary multifactor ranking model we believe investing in stocks with attractive valuations that also possess fundamental strength and market acceptance increases the probability of alpha generation over the short and long term generally our proprietary model provides a composite ranking by separately scoring the fundamentals relevant to a particular strategy based on inputs that are individually validated by our portfolio management team the cornerstone of the process piv is double weighted since the composite ranking allows securities to be compared across sectors and regions based on their fundamentals we are able to both build and monitor portfolios with this process success measured by client satisfaction we know that client satisfaction is the ultimate measure of a firms success todd asset management strives to diligently execute our process each and every day todd asset management expects to continue its tradition of

information the lciv posted a gain of  gross of fees in the quarter slightly trailing sp  and russell  value returns of  and  respectively for the quarter year to date and over the trailing year the lciv is comfortably ahead of both indexes with the sp gaining a little more than  year to date we see a number of points investors should be aware of including the range of ytd returns by sp  sector are as follows utilities  energy  healthcare  info technology  materials  consumer staples  financials  industrial   telecom  and consumer discretionary  range of ytd total returns by asset class are sp  up  sp midcap up  sp smallcap up  russell  value  russell  up  and barclays agg etf  profit taking in the consumer discretionary and industrial stocks has been one of the biggest drivers of performance in domestic markets as investors saw harsh weather slow the economy rotation into utilities and energy defined the quarter healthcare also performed well as takeovers and safety spurred interest geopolitical uncertainty think ukraine and iraq has caused oil to rise helping energy shares the fed continues to taper yet volatility has declined and many bankscapital markets players are suffering mergers and acquisitions have surged especially in health care technology and media most are occurring close to our calculated intrinsic value we are pleased with the performance of the strategy because even being underweighted in the sectors that have performed best we are still performing well while the fed has been tapering their bond purchases the market has been rewarding the traditional investment disciplines based on valuations fundamental and technical disciplines and not simply bidding up high beta stocks we present our customary charts on what factors have been helping or hindering performance for us stocks below while beta was rewarded over the past year it has shifted to the underperformers in the most recent quarter valuations favoring cash flow returns to shareholders and a ccounting book value have helped performance over the past quarter along with certain momentum measures most other factors that we consider attractive tended to detract from returns during the quarter perhaps as a result of the extraordinary actions the ecb and bank of japan are undertaking chart    compared to the sp  during the quarter stock selection helped our performance while sector allocation detracted the net result was to slightly underperform the index during the quarter our best contributors on stock selection were the consumer staples and industrials specific stocks that helped were altria and walgreens in the consumer staples sector and united rentals and illinois tool works in the industrials the areas that cost us the most in stock selection were financials and materials specifically bank of america and jp morgan chase as well as cf industries were laggards we did remove bank of america from the portfolio during the quarter on our sector weights we were overweighted the industrials financials and consumer discretionary compared to the sp  and underweighted the staples energy and materials sectors positioning in the energy and financial sectors cost us performance versus the sp  compared to the russell  value stock selection cost us a modest amount while sector weightings helped a bit stock selections in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors detracted from portfolio performance whirlpool and macys were the laggards in discretionary while emc and oracle lagged the tech group our choices in the consumer staples and industrials helped our performance and the leaders and laggards are noted above our best performing stocks were conoco phillips intel apple covidien and gannett company the laggards were bank of america express scripts whirlpool jp morgan and cf industries among the leaders covidien was the beneficiary of a takeover bid by medtronic while intel and apple both are benefitting from better expectations on technology device sales we have booked the profit and sold the covidien shares they are both seeing upward revisions to estimates conoco phillips is benefitting from better ep results gannett is benefitting from higher operating earnings resulting from the acquisition of ah belos broadcasting business bank of america and jp morgan have both suffered from continuing concerns about government actions stemming from the financial crisis express scripts declined after weaker results in the first quarter prompted a reduction in estimates whirlpool saw a weaker thanexpected q as a result of the bad weather and cf weakened as commodity prices declined our multi factor model continues to highlight the more economically sensitive sectors as attractive at this juncture capital spending is firming up as we begin to see expenditures on technology improving additionally we view the recent increase in mergers as a way for companies to increase capacity without having to resort to the vagaries of actually building factories this could be a precursor to increasing demand for productive capacity and it certainly indicates a newfound confidence among management teams interesting charts from the us that we saw this quarter we can go into chapter and verse about the quarter the negative gdp the geopolitical crises or any number of other items about recent market action but the most important chart to look at is the rolling ten year market returns chart  chart  chart  chart  charts like the timeline above are always useful in our opinion since the beginning of the year the market has reached new highs despite several notable economic and geopolitical headwinds we thought some pause was likely after the first quarter as midterm elections are coming up in the us as we look forward we cannot rule out a pause but having shrugged off a russian invasion of the ukraine the dissolution of iraq as we know it and a hugely negative print on gdp growth were hard pressed to say what is likely to cause this market to backtrack we believe the combination of a recovery in economic growth and continued low short term rates in the us indicates the path of least resistance is still up for the sp  as always we are here to assist you if you need any additional information please feel free to contact any of us jack white cfa      curt scott cfa      jack holden
