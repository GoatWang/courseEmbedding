bridgestonefirestone latin america before his promotion to chairman ceo and president of bridgestonefirestone north american tire llc bfnt in september he will be in charge of bfnts sales organization plus its product development and manufacturingmodern tire dealer sat down with emkes during appropriately enough the international tire expo to find out how bridgestonefirestone plans to proceed in mtd what are your brand plans in emkes were putting more of an emphasis on the major brands bridgestone and firestone bridgestone will be the presenting sponsor for cart championship auto racing teams in  and well get much more exposure with firestone in the irl indy racing league now that weve signed up for four more years so we will continue to have a big focus on motor sports in particular open wheel racing with cart irl and formula onealso bridgestone and firestone billboards will be in times square for new years  thats where people start the year and they will start with our brandsmtd can you quantify the benefit of being in formula oneemkes thats not easy to measure but with formula one racing in indianapolis theres no doubt it helps our brand awareness and i think it creates an excitement among our dealersmtd what new products can we expect to see in emkes we havent put the finishing touches on our new products one of the things we have to do is to make sure our dealers can compete and make money in the marketplace well have more highend productsmtd will you be expanding the firehawk indy tire lineemkes i think thats a fair statementmtd what about the dayton brandemkes thats part of our good concept in the goodbetterbest philosophy dayton was the tire sponsor of the indy lights series before it ended promotional plans for the dayton brand will be forthcoming later this year or early in and that sort of leads me a little bit into the tread transportation recall enhancement accountability and documentation act we as a company are thinking there will be more of a trend toward tire enhancement coming down the pike with the tread act we think the act will have more of an impact on the cost of a lowercost private brand than it will on a major so our  marketing plans are more directed on major brandsmtd how will the tread acts early warning reporting provisions affect youemkes what the tread act has proposed is complicated but even though its not real clear we have a feel for what is coming down the pipeline were ahead of the curve because of the actions we implemented over a year ago with initiatives in our making it right campaign from what we know at this time the cost of complying with the tread act provisions is considerablemtd how do both large and small independent tire dealers fit into bridgestonefirestones philosophy of doing businessemkes it may sound simple but if our dealers are successful we will be successful and if our dealers are not successful then eventually we will not be successful we will focus on their success we have jobs because dealers buy tires we better listen to them and take care of them our affiliated dealer and tirestarz programs cater to all types of dealersmtd what channels do you distribute tires throughemkes we have the family channel which includes dealers and the companyowned stores and then the mass merchandisers like sears and costco the family channel accounts for about  of our business some of the business we do with muffler shops and car dealers go through tire dealersmtd will you expand your companyowned store chainemkes as a general statement there is going to be calculated growth in our companyowned store channel but our stores are run by bfs retail and commercial operations llc a different division not under my supervision still there is a lot of synergy between the twomtd one of our readers wanted me to ask you about fill rates he said he needs more product because he sells all he getsemkes ive heard that too the answer for that is our sales have exceeded expectations how are we addressing that in july we began an tireaday expansion at our plant in costa rica which we are going to run seven days a week were also expanding in mexico by the middle of  well be producing  more tires a day seven days a week well also increase production in brazil by mid we have wonderful working relations with workers in those countriesmtd but is any of that growth targeted at the usemkes yes we realize we have to put more capacity in place we will continue to import more product from japan right now my focus is on sourcing we are running our plants in the us at full capacitymtd thank you mark bob ulrich editor helpful share share close facebook twitter google mail comments    post comment more stories news july   sullivan tire adds mobile access live chat
