money president of american express abruptly resigns by kenneth n gilpin published september   in a surprise move jeffrey e stiefler president of the american express company abruptly tendered his resignation yesterday telling the company he was leaving at the end of the month mr stiefler who is  is a longtime associate of harvey golub the companys chairman and chief executive the two men spent much of the s together at the companys ids subsidiary the minneapolisbased mutual fund and financial planning company that is now called american express financial advisors in june  after mr golub was named to the top job he tapped mr stiefler who at the time was running ids to come to new york as president together the two men were the sole occupants of what the company called the office of the chief executive in a letter that was distributed publicly as well as to american express employees mr golub said mr stieflers resignation is based on his longstanding desire to work at a less intense pace and in an environment that allows him to spend more time with his family mr golub said mr stiefler intended to move to california and plans to pursue business opportunities in that part of the country michael oneill a company spokesman said mr stiefler was not available for comment mr stieflers resignation marks the second time he has left american express which he first joined a dozen years ago in  he quit his job as senior vice president for marketing at ids to run the meritor savings bank a subsidiary of the philadelphia savings fund society he returned in  as executive vice president of sales and marketing at ids analysts declined to talk on the record about mr stieflers resignation but they said that despite its abrupt nature the move was not that surprising over the last two years mr golub has made a number of moves that suggested that mr stieflers star was waning in august  mr golub added a third executive to the office of chief executive naming jonathan s linen  as vice chairman this year two more men have been moved into that office in janaury kenneth i chenault  formerly president of travel and related services at american express was named vice chairman with responsibility for the companys consumer card and international businesses and in april mr golub recruited george l farr  a former colleague at mckinsey  company to join american express as another vice chairman it was increasingly difficult for stiefler to have an impact because of all these new contenders one analyst said and increasingly his name was not attached to important highly visible projects as president mr stieflers principal responsibilities were overseeing the american express bank an enterprise that its parent is now trying to sell as well as american express financial advisors in his letter mr golub said the position of president would not be filled and that mr stieflers responsibilities would be assumed by himself and the other members of the office of the chief executive the analyst said the presidents job isnt likely to be vacant for all that long one day american express will have a president again news of mr stieflers resignation was released after the final bell at the new york stock exchange where american express stock closed at  down  cents a share   inside nytimescom health raquo too hot to handle arts » the harmony of liberty opinion
