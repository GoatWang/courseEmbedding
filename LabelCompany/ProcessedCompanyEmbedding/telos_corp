directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

us for three decades the brands of the telos alliance have revolutionized radio and television by pioneering disruptive cuttingedge audio technology with the goal of helping global networks and local stations produce better programming improve audience engagement and bolster ratings the telos alliance is made up of six brands—telos® systems omnia® audio axia® audio linear acoustic® seven® systems and minnetonka™ audio distinctly and collectively these brands raise the bar for support performance and innovation in the radio and television industries just look at our pedigree to see the evidence axia audio invented audio over ip for broadcast and contributed time and resources to the effort that led to the aes standard telos systems was the first to create a broadcast audio phone system that included dsp processing to dramatically improve the quality of onair phone calls from an audio processing standpoint omnia audio created the first alldigital fm audio processor dspbased broadcast audio processor broadcast processor to have aes composite output single side band ssb for fm stereo and audio over ip seven is the creator of voltair the first manufacturer to challenge the status quo in the ratings watermarking arena on the tv side minnetonka created the first professionallevel graphical audio editing software for pc platform and multitrack surround sound editor meanwhile linear acoustic has received a technical emmy® for “pioneering development of an audiometadata processor for conforming audio to the atsc standard” among other honors  in  telos alliance formed the tv solutions group a new division to focus on the expanding needs of the tv and broadcast markets providing solutions that aid broadcasters in the transition to the latest tv industry technology including aes headquartered in cleveland ohio usa the telos alliance is a truly international company with offices and dealers around the world                  meet the leaders   telos alliance cleveland headquarters tour   telos alliance awards   telos systems—part of the telos alliance—was founded in  by steve church a talk show radio host and engineer who was dissatisfied with the poor quality of the onair telephone calls on his shows he was also an engineer determined to do something about it the resulting telos  telephone interface system was a great success inspiring steve to build a business to make and sell the systems telos systems has since become the industry leader in broadcast telephone systems and ip and isdn codecs the breakthrough telos zephyr audio codec for example is one of the most successful digital broadcast products in history with more than  in use worldwide telos telephone hybrids and onair talk show systems set the performance benchmark for the industry and we continue to pioneer groundbreaking technology that pushes boundaries and gives broadcasters the telephony solutions they need for reliability efficiency and the best possible sound quality   way back in  axia audio the studio audio division of the telos alliance invented audio over ip for broadcast we did what no one had ever done before—create professional radio gear that networks using standard ethernet for use in digital audio routing mixing and distribution systems for broadcast and other pro audio applications the foundational technology in all axia products is livewire plus aes—we call it livewire—an aoip protocol that enables highreliability lowdelay uncompressed digital audio over ethernet including audio logic control and program associated data pad devices connect together using standard ethernet cables audio and control routing is accomplished with offtheshelf ethernet switches axia livewire has builtin compliance with the aes standard thats because axia and the telos alliance are committed proponents of aoip interoperability—first as charter supporting members of the x working group that defined aes and now as founding members of the media networking alliance a group of prominent equipment manufacturers formed to actively promote the adoption and implementation of the aes standard today axia mixing consoles digital audio routers broadcast intercom systems and routing control software—along with other telos brands and  partners—are powering broadcast studios around the globe with more than  mixing consoles and  networked audio devices   omnia audio—part of the telos alliance—was founded by frank foti who used audio engineeringprocessing to enable stations to craft a unique ‘signature sound’ that was louder than anything else on the air yet with clear sound and no distortion this processing is at the core of omnia products allowing stations to stand out among the competition on a crowded dial omnia has continued to innovate with leadingedge and solutionsoriented broadcast audio technology and numerous accolades and awards under its belt in fact omnia is now the brand leader in audio processing processingencoding for streaming audio voice processing analysis tools and studio audio processing its products are the choice of the majority of the top  rated stations in america and are used at most major stations worldwide omnia continues to push the envelope to give broadcasters the tools they need to amplify customize and perfect sound signatures   founded in  seven systems —a part of the telos alliance—began with the idea to marry ultracomplex time compression algorithms that would allow radio stations more effective and efficient broadcast time the resulting product—audio time manager—became radio’s preeminent solution for realtime compression and timeshifting and has been used at some of the biggest talk stations in the world always on the bleeding edge seven then reinvented the profanity delay with program delay manager adding the unprecedented capability to capture objectionable live content for future review now seven systems specializes in audio technologies and products that address unique problems in the industry most recently seven has produced one of the most disruptive technologies in broadcast history—the voltair line of watermarking enhancement products which became one of the hottest and most gamechanging products in the industry   linear acoustic was founded in  by tim carroll the first linear acoustic product was the octimax  audio processor with the onset of digital television came myriad problems involving loudness and digital audio control linear acoustic turned their attentions to solving these problems at every stage of the digital audio chain and soon developed a product range that made digital broadcast sound work as it should audio over ip aoip has been embraced by the radio side of broadcasting for many years where the myriad advantages of networked audio via the livewireaes standard is well known now aoip is available for television audio thanks to linear acoustic aerosoft™ the linear acoustic sdi xnode deembeds two separate hdsdsdi inputs converts it to up to  channels of livewireaes audio makes it available for processing upmixing and encoding in the brandnew aerosoft processing engine and then reembeds the audio into two independent sdi outputs this provides unmatched flexibility scalability and channel density  in  linear received a technical emmy® for the pioneering development of an audiometadata processor for conforming audio to the atsc standard and has provided upmixing loudness metering encoding products and technical support for nbc’s coverage of the  bejing summer games the  vancouver winter games the london  summer games the  sochi winter games and most recently the  summer games in rio   founded by john schur minnetonka audio software inc masi was formally incorporated in  with the charter to produce professional quality digital audio editing products as the technology evolved masi maintained a position as a technology leader and was the first to produce a multitrack surround sound editor mx the discwelder series of products for authoring dvdaudio discs continued the company’s lead in supporting highresolution and surround audio formats masi continues its industry leadership with the development of the surcode series of audio encoding products to support industrystandard formats including dolby e dolby digital dolby digital plus dolby pro logic ii dts and dtshd surcode is known in the industry as the “go to” brand of ready to use surround sound as plugins for major daw’s nle’s and oem in  masi introduced a first of its kind an audio only asset management and automation platform called audiotools server it has quickly become the standard for major broadcasters because of the encapsulated audio expertise required for tasks such as loudness control in a filebased environment expanding on the success of audiotools server audiotools cloud was introduced in  as the first amazon aws “application” to offer audio specific workflow tools for broadcasters post houses and more allowing businesses to only pay for what they need when they need it memberships ​
