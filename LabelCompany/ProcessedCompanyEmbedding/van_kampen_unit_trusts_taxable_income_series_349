be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the initial date of deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities

impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case upon trust termination or in the course of satisfying large unit redemptions  objectives and bond selection the objective of a

of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires

factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain bonds in the trusts has been obtained from bond insurance company see insurance on the bonds risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poor s rating services sp downgraded the longterm  sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trust s holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bond s issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls or the credit rating on a bond included in a blackrock trust or a variable rate trust is downgraded as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant with respect only to a variable rate trust because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to a variable rate trust on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in a variable rate trust s net asset values during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of a variable rate trust s floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates certain bonds in a high yield trust may be subject to interest rate adjustments if either moodys investors service inc  moody s  sp s or fitch or in certain limited circumstances another ratings service downgrades the rating for such bond or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade the interest rates payable on certain bonds in a high yield trust may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and consequently may adversely affect both the income you receive from the securities in a high yield trust and the value of your units on the other hand increases in a bonds interest rate related to decreases in such bonds credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bonds issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating decreases additionally an increase in a bonds interest rate may increase the risk that the bonds issuer will prepay or call the bond before its stated maturity credit risk is the risk that a security s issuer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security while interest and principal payments on ginnie mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government a gnma income portfolio and the units thereof are not guaranteed or insured by the us government or any government agency in addition neither the us government nor ginnie mae guarantees the market value or yield on ginnie mae securities prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans earlier than expected and in particular may affect the units of a gnma income portfolio this reduces the trust s life and future interest income any payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called prepayment most mortgage loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty each mortgagebacked security payment includes a return of principal as well as interest prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or sell their homes they may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of lower interest rate mortgages as interest rates decrease the rate of refinancings may increase significantly thereby increasing the prepayment risk of mortgagebacked securities extra monthly principal payments made near the trust s inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the borrower to the lender and therefore the future amount received by the trust your trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal you also might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough principal is prepaid on the securities in your trust your trust could terminate significantly earlier than expected  call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bond s call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond s par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereof in prospectus part i bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bond s rating concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections a gnma income portfolio concentrates in mortgagebacked securities you should understand these securities before you invest these securities are described in detail in the section titled ginnie mae securities extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the trust s life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgagebacked securities as a result the securities in your trust and in particular any mortgagebacked securities in a gnma income portfolio may become more sensitive to rising interest rates and may decrease in value foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trust s investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trust s portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses high yield bond risk high yield trusts invest primarily in high yield bonds other trusts may hold bonds currently rated below investment grade following one or more downgrades high yield or junk bonds are frequently issued  view more similar

unit investment trust included in van kampen unit trusts taxable income series  monthly semiannual distributions distributions   estimated current return   estimated long term return   cusip e e estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates prospectus part i november   this prospectus contains two parts no one may use this prospectus part i unless accompanied by prospectus part ii you should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference  the securities and exchange commission has not approved or disapproved of the trust units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus any contrary representation is a criminal offense van kampen investments investment objective the trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of longterm bonds insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investors service inc rating of aaa o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payment in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bond in the portfolio are listed under portfolio diversification on the next page o the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of issuers located in california these issuers make up approximately  of the principal amount of the bonds the financial condition of california is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of units o we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold the same bonds even

trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of longterm bonds the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds the objective of a laddered trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately     and  years from the date of deposit there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a with respect to insured trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investor service inc moodys rating of aaa and with respect to all other trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of at least bbb a moodys rating of at least baa or if not rated credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in a longterm investment grade trust or an investment grade trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in an insured trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust neither the public offering price nor any evaluation of units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by an insured trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringunit price in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the standard  poors rating of bbb or at least the moodys investors service inc rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by a trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by an insured trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by standard  poors standard  poors describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in prospectus part i additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals consumer product and retail issuers your trust may invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but will require sophisticated technology to remain competitive financial services companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by financial services companies any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the recently enacted grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the securities markets in general adverse changes in the direction of the securities markets investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes telecommunications companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your trust competitive pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of other issuers more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the sales charge for an intermediateterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge for a laddered trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds and the sales charge for a longterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life sales charge                                            to   the eltr life represents the

financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any

for the purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level the reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing units for a single trust estate including multiple trusts created under a single estate or fiduciary account to be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph all purchases must be made on the same day through a single brokerdealer or selling agent you must inform your brokerdealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge letter of intentfor purposes of

purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to the unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to the unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if the unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever the unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended amount fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee

which a comprehensive wrap fee charge wrap fee is imposed fee accounts if the units are purchased for a fee account and the trust is subject to a wrap fee ie the trust is wrap fee eligible the sponsor

employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts unit price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states during the

this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income expenses  general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the trusts amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts all costs and expenses incurred in creating and establishing the trusts including the cost of the initial preparation printing and execution of the trust agreement and the certificates legal and accounting

the total amount received for providing these services to all van kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the total cost of providing the services in any calendar year the evaluator will receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i for evaluating each trusts portfolio for its services the trustee will receive the fee indicated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i which may be reduced as described therein part of the trustees compensation for its services is expected to result from

sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds consumer product and retail issuers the trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services companies the trust may invest in issuers within the bank and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin recently bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted but volume gains have been strong in both commercial and consumer products there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the recently enacted grammleachbliley financialservices overhaul legislation will allow banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture telecommunications issuers because your trust may be concentrated in bonds issued by telecommunications companies the value of the units may be susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services a trust may also invest in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by a trust taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds in an insured trust insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in each insured trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior the deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus each insurance policy obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such insured trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such insured trust see portfolio for the trust in the prospectus part i nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such insured trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an insured trust are fixed for the life of an insured trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from an insured trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such insured trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise an insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basisthe insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by an insured trust insurance policy may be sold out of the insured trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the insured trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the insured trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in the prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if the insured trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the insured trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the insured trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in the prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bond not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default ambac assurance corporation ambac assurance effective july   ambac indemnity corporation changed its name to ambac assurance corporation the insurance policy of ambac assurance obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in the insurance policy are held by an insured trust a monthly premium is paid by an insured trust for the insurance policy obtained by it the trustee will pay when due successively the full amount of each installment of the insurance premium pursuant to a binding agreement with ambac assurance in the event of a sale of a bond covered by the ambac assurance insurance policy the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance
