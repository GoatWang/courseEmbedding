defective products claims defective products and medications injure hundreds of thousands of people every year through careful and detailed investigation of these claims peter thompson  associates has successfully represented many mainers who were injured by products and medications that had not been properly tested or had problems that were ignored by the manufacturer in determining whether a product is defective a manufacturer is required to take into account expected human error and act reasonably to prevent avoidable injury when that type of human error occurs often a part that costs no more than a few cents can save a person’s life or prevent serious injury at peter thompson  associates we are proud of our effort and the efforts of other attorneys who handle these types of cases to hold manufacturers accountable for their negligence in design or in resolving known problems with defective products and medicationsour firm uses the very best experts to assess whether a product or medication is defective through the use of expert analysis and through examination of a company’s internal records we have an excellent track record of success in defective product and medication cases in a recent case we were able to show that a manufacturer knew about a flaw in the design of a saw guard and had been told by its own engineers to correct the flaw despite having been advised of the safety hazard the manufacturer nevertheless chose to keep manufacturing and distributing the saw with the defectour firm also uses the best experts in the field to determine the nature and extent of our clients’ injuries treating physicians are generally willing to provide some information about our client’s future restrictions and the future impact of hisher injuries however because treating doctors often do not have the time or inclination to provide a thorough analysis of the future impact of injuries on work activities and other activities of daily living we use the best experts in the field to provide more comprehensive analysis of these issues in order to prove our cases we find that by providing this type of detailed and comprehensive analysis to insurance companies we are able to settle cases favorably without having to go to court over  percent of the time insurance companies know attorney thompson’s reputation in court and in the vast majority of cases choose to settle rather than risking an unfavorable result at trial and having to pay the high the costs associated with trial contact us free consultation  name required email required phone required message enter

as important as getting the compensation they need and deserve peter thompson and his legal team are committed to fighting for accountability and justice “we are in this fight to make our communities and hospitals safer places for our families and children” we’re here to help we also understand the stress that is caused by serious injuries and for that reason do everything possible to minimize

intros and outros on tuesday rd march i spoke at a recruitment summit as a favour for a friend using the intro and outro techniques shared by peter  potential clients booked appointments into my calendar for  sessions if only  of those convert into clients that will be worth a minum of k in the next  months thank you so much to whole of the team for sharing some great stuffawesome terry edwards i left my career in marketing last year to pursue my passion for nutrition and start my own business all the conditions were right but i wasnt prepared for the complete feeling of overwhelm and confusion i felt in the first few months i thought my marketing and corporate experience would carry me through but this was very different from what id imagined since being part of peters mentoring programme ive felt really supported and that i had a structure to help me move forward having access to all this knowledge feedback and encouragement has enabled me to achieve things much faster and avoiding many mistakes im sure than i could possibly have done by myself my first workshop brought in £ which is a very good start and im already building on that looking to systemise my process to attract clients to my weight loss programme by creating a webinar programme without peters help and importantly the wealth of tips and information i glean each month from all the fantastic people in the group i wouldnt even have know where to start i really feel i have no reason not to succeed now angela steele since joining the mentoring group i ran a webinar i started promoting it less than  working days before i posted an announcement on  of my own linkedin groups i didnt post on anybody elses groups plus one email on the monday to members  people registered lesson   you can fill a webinar within  hours of it starting i advertised it as a  minute webinar it ended up lasting  hour and  minutes  people turned up for the webinar and  were still there an hour later then within minutes it dropped to  lesson   if you tell people it will last a certain time and you exceed that they may plan other things in their diary and be forced to drop out and we generated £ of sales on the day mark wickersham since joining the mentoring group and applying the ideas my subscribers have gone from from  to  and i anticipate similar growth next year marianne cowdrey we joined the mentoring course because we felt we were stuck in the same old groove and needed some new ideas to improve our business we were not disappointed we now have so many ideas the one i feel has made the most financially beneficial as yet is the rewriting of our monthly offer letters we run weekly training course and the number of delegates attending has doubled since we changed increasing our turnover by at least £ as our competition offer similar courses for free we are very pleased with this increase chris  lynda chanin let me give you some advice right now  right here dont talk to these guys if you want your life to run without frustration the frustration of sitting on an extra £ per month without even knowing it the frustration of getting  extra great ideas that will enhance my business with a minimum of work and the biggest frustration of all – being in business for all these years of struggle not knowing that the answer was staring me in the face jeff pettitt being the export expert i work with multimillion international companies to help them grow their global business before i joined peters mentoring programme i did a lot of thinking looked at where else i could spend my money and what the outcome and profitability would be for me and my companyand i told peter this up front taking the time for my own business instead of always focusing on everyone elses has given us the impetus to be bolder plan for the future create new revenue streams and most importantly for us use peters influence to create highlevel contacts to further develop our business we are now focused on the scalability within our business and no longer too busy making money to make real money as my wife always says gary jennings i was too bogged down in being busy to have made any real progress in month  i have  products of varying value   of which are complete and out there  of which are nearly done and another  in creation this focus has been so useful for me personally and the benefit of the groups contribution peters facilitation and steves awesome monthly calls have combined to make it the best value for money training i have ever attended david hyner since investing in the mentoring course with peter thomson i have a greater knowledge of how to run seminars his advice helped me run my first workshop which generated £ i am also in the process of developing more products which will net me thousands of pounds in the future i would definitely recommend this training to anyone who is serious about developing their business if they are a speakerauthorcoach bernie de souza i used the xxxxxxxx this morning it really did make a difference to how the meeting went and when i indicated £xxxx as my day rate double what i usually say he simply said ok well i will have to find the budget wont i eureka moment you guys rock – i really do appreciate all those little gems its been a long time since i felt this fired up for all sorts of reasons and having people to kick me like i kick my clients is just what i need diane dykes in my first hour with peter and steve they opened my eyes to multiple amazing business strategies and one of those strategies that i applied from the very next day has easily earned me around £ more this year alone the mentoring group really support each other too our recent visit to spain opened my eyes to far greater business ideas i wouldnt have dreamed about a year ago apart from having a wealth of experience and knowledge to share they really care about your results as much as you do ive not only gained a great business mentors but a great friends too stephen tierney after my mentoring call i changed the copy to incorporate your idea and waited with baited breath that one single advert produced  full paying clients for my

to publish the road map for the coming season so they can try and keep pace but heres the kicker – how can they keep pace when i have peter thomson in my corner a simple email to the man will normally unstick any stuckness the man talks simple common sense – but its only common sense after hes revealed it to you jeff pettitt a  h international out of the  speakers at our event peter was rated number  – by a mile it was no surprise to hear our delegates say how much theyd enjoyed his downtoearth presentation his practical ideas and his warm and friendly style gill fielding the wealth company we needed someone to inspire the  attendees of our roadshows and give them some simple tools for business success peters presentation was first class and a learning experience that was enjoyed by everyone who attended graham boulger commercial director  paymentshield i think there are lots of ideas in achievers edge that help me in my life in addition to new thoughts however one of the key things for me is it is often a reminder of things i know but that have got somehow lost in the hurly burly of my thinking about life as an example recently i was listening to the edge and peter talked about the need to live life to the full live every week and day as if you are your last life has only a finite number of days now i know this there is nothing new here and this idea has influenced me before in fact this point was only  mins of the months programme but those comments and ideas from peter influenced my life for a week after i listened to the programme every day i thought about making the most of my day before that idea submerged itself back into my unconscious thoughts my week was a whirlwind of particularly rewarding business and personal activity i could give you other examples too so the value of achievers edge to me is that it goes beyond being a source of new ideas it is also a reminder of the basic cornerstone of my self talk the need to set goals be positive think the impossible celebrate life influence others by looking at life from their perspective etc etc it helps me to refocus and check i am really doing the things i believe in daryl howe i met peter thomson in january  when he conducted a workshop for our senior directors we were so impressed with his content and presentation we hired peter to work with us on a sales and marketing strategy after only one day he came up with an idea that we thought was electrifying we implemented the idea in total and committed resources and expenditure to ensure it worked for us since then the idea has made us over £ gbp in additional profit we are still using the idea today and it is our constant lead generation strategy peter thomson is undoubtedly the uks leading sales and marketing strategist and i would recommend to anyone who want to improve their sales and marketing results to use peter as we have done over the last  ½ years maris interiors llp is the uks leading office design and fit out specialist with  people and revenues exceeding £m per annum michael howard chief executive maris interiors i met peter after a speaking engagement about  years ago it was so invigorating that i just had to subscribe and become a part of the achievers edge family  years later i still feel that way every month new ideas an injection of positive thinking and optimism grounded in usable ideas specifics peters advice on planning over the longer term countless tips from guest speakers the double prioritised todo list theyre woven in to my life these days richard mcdougal as a subscriber to peters audio programme the achievers edge i have gained numerous ideas and tips on how to achieve more success both in my personal and business life his practical and thought provoking messages inspired me to start my own web site and share my own ideas and experiences with small business owners worldwide his motivational and inspirational prompts have led me to achieve great things in my life i unreservedly recommend you listen and take action on peters ideas and advice robert warlow peter thomson is one of the most eloquent persuasive and thought provoking communicators that weve had

clients our allnew program with peter the bestkept secrets of the worlds great achievers is like a modern day think and grow rich and has been anticipated for months dan strutzel vice president publishing nightingale conant usa i can totally recommend tgimondays and membership of the achievers club since i started feeding my brain with positive messages and taking peters advice i think i started subscribing to the achievers edge in  i have risen from the ranks of sales executive right through to managing director and the company has gone from £m per annum to £m this year and returning a stunning bottom line it hasnt all been down to peters expert guidance – but he certainly has given me an edge which has enabled us to outsmart the competition many times thank you for everything peter ballard i cannot begin to fully quantify the benefits that i have accrued through working with your products it all started eight years ago when seeing you personally deliver some of your tried and tested systems i actually started to take action and implement a number of your ideas as you know i have three thriving businesses and a million pounds property in stratforduponavon i sold a business a couple of years ago for £ i can say without a doubt that these things would not have happened without using the pti systems and your great ideas even better things are about to follow i know that anyone who takes action can achieve so much more by following your processes most pleasing is the benefit of passing the enhanced knowledge gained through the personal and business development to those close to me in life my family friends clients and team members your enthusiasm is infectious thank you so very much mark allen managing director squosh software limited i have been an  achievers edge subscriber for around  years now and have found the material invaluable i always find the monthly issues interesting and useful picking out areas that are relevant to me now as well as know that i am building an archive of back issues that allow me to dip into them in the future i very much look forward to the guest interviews as they provide fascinating insights into how other people have made a success of themselves and often offer more than a book or audio programme as you are asking questions and getting responses that are relevant for your subscribers i have also benefited immensely from the audio extracts as this section has introduced me to many audio programmes that i would never otherwise have considered buying through more traditional medium this is because being able to listen to  mins or so allows you to quickly make up your mind as to whether youd benefit from the rest of the programme much of my audio library has been built on hearing extracts from the achievers edge i would highly recommend the  achievers edge for anyone who is serious about developing themselves in any area of this wonderful thing called life marc carter the achievers edge has provided me with great inspiration and advice on how to grow my new business it allows me to share in the knowledge of peter thomson and other leading successful business leaders who would not normally be available to me the achievers edge is an excellent business tool offering great advice and fresh ideas to meet the day to day and long term challenges of running a business and ones life tom murray fcma managing director  profit partners ltd i have been a subscriber to the achievers edge for ½ since you first started the series i remember then being attracted to the monthly magazine on tape because i could listen to it in the car and was spending around  hours per day travelling at that time working in sales i soon found a number of ideas that have helped me over the years and i remember an early series on change which made an impact on me since then i have always tried to adapt to change positively and as a result i have been promoted a number of times and currently hold a job that i have been after for some years there have been many ideas over the years that have given me that edge and have helped me be ahead of the game if you will excuse the cliché i have used a number of your ideas and also ideas from your guests to good effect and could probably use more one particular life changing feature early in  stood out for me was about limiting our exposure if i recall correctly to financial risk i remember you making the point about being prepared for the unexpected and reducing our reliance on one critical income to pay our debts etc well since then and after purchasing a number of programmes from nightingale conant i hope to pay off my mortgage this year eight years after i first made the decision to pay it off early from a financial point of view i have taken your advice and that of john commuta bob procter and robert kiyosaki and i am sure that we will benefit from it in the future as well as my children who have watched our circumstances change we are better organised for the constant possibility of reengineering however it is interesting that as i have increased my adaptability and flexibility and at the same time have become more prepared i am given bigger assignments and have just taken on another role which should keep my thoroughly busy for the next three years each month i look forward to your envelope arriving with my monthly dose of positive thinking and ideas one thing remains important to me and that is the monthly achievers edge please keep up the good work and you may not know it but you have had a substantial impact on my career and our wealth finally i am not sure where this thought came from that i have used successfully in sales training the thought is that before we can earn we must learn clearly placing the l in front of earn demonstrates how our earning potential is limited only by our ability to learn education really is the key richard vis i always like listening to your programme i find them interesting informative and uplifting a lot of what we hear from day to day in the media is bad news and doom and gloom your programmes are a change from that i know that listening to your programmes and other various nightingale conant programmes is definitely life improving if you use the ideas in my case it is in a lot of subtle ways as apposed to specifics for example when dealing with people and certain situation i can hear certain peoples voices and quotes from the programmes in my head these lead me to behave and reactrespond in different and better ways ian popplewell the achievers edge continually provides thoughts and ideas that produce positive and effective change in my work and social life it is the single best source of business psychology and self development in an easily digested format it is the first publication that i would recommend to anyone who is interested in self improvement inspirational bob caren peter thomson is a business person who enthusiastically embraces every aspect of business in which he is engaged that enthusiasm is embodied in his skills as an accomplished author masterful interviewer and presenter par excellence all these attributes and more he brings to his monthly business and personal development audio programme the achievers edge if you are a budding entrepreneur – grab the achievers edge with both hands if you are already a successful entrepreneur and aim to stay that way the achievers edge will supply great ideas to help keep you ahead of the field if you are neither of the above but perhaps a cog large or small on the corporate business wheel beset by endless board and committee meetings and ponderous decision making to name but a few then seize the achievers edge for the breath of fresh air that it will undoubtedly prove to be filled with independent thinking constructive ideas business nous and a total absence of hierarchical presumption worth its subscription for the monthly interview alone martin tunstall i am writing to express how i have achieved my goals through the achievers edge i have been a subscriber for  years and started as a shopkeeper i am now the neath town mayor and have been since june  i feel that all my success has been achieved by the ideas i learned in the achiever edge and i will continue to be a subscriber for the rest of my life g singh town mayor the achievers edge audio package is a superb programme  i have found it to be tremendously useful and very practical each month it is full of great ideas that can be put to immediate use kevin whiltshire peter we were in the car driving home from work and i have to tell you the achievers edge is just wonderful it has given me so much to think about for my business and we are always eager to implement

attend pete bennett i was very skeptical that i was capable of making and marketing my own products it seemed too daunting overwhelming and mission impossible the information strategies exercises and peterisms have turned it into a i cant wait too and dont stop me now im having such a good time marcia gladwin an excellent course packed to bursting with useful strategies hints and tips if youre serious about making money from creating your own products then you should definitely attend this practical downtoearth course helen leach first hour alone was worth the course and every other hour was at least as good thanks a million peter and team mark bristow ive had a great time learning how to take my ideas to market the course was ver precise and informative i feel it represents great value the money thank you paul ribbons i now know that i can create and sell product and make money from it simon davies although i do force myself to read books for me audio learning is far the most easiest and cost effective method of taking in information especially when driving long distance when i will take the three most recent tapes and play them with rest gaps between sides listening to the radio i find the variety of monthly topics interesting applicable and very much relevant to business today especially where nothing in what we do is entirely predicable the first program i listened too was your th tape many years ago i now have a big pile of tapes and for the cost of two cups of coffee a week the latte factor investment index i get access to a lot of information peoples experiences and the opportunity to put new ideas in to practice on reflection i have also purchased many of the audio programs and books by achievers edge guests – their work i find a great resource that i use to help me my colleagues or friends the personal touch is very important it is comforting and many of the ideas taken from the program have worked very well for me in business my personal life and in helping others especially young people looking at starting out in business paul unger this programme is packed with fantastic ideas inspiring my imagination to produce more and more inspiring products michael snuggs there was so much information help tips and great details which was shared it excelled beyond my expectations i have all the resources i need vanessa barker could it be that i am the only environmental health officer subscribing to the achievers edge if any of my colleagues around the country do also subscribe i bet i have been receiving it for the longest time i still have all the tapes neatly filed the first being tape ten of volume one they are not just filed and forgotten of course because i do still dip into them from time to time to jog my memory or retrieve a particular snippet i first became a subscriber when i was running my own consultancy and continued even when i returned to working full time in local government over six years ago because i found your monthly offerings so interesting and helpful whilst my qualifications and experience cover a wide range of subjects i have specialised in health and safety since  although employed as an enforcement officer my real work has revolved around providing advice and guidance  much of it to new and fledgling businesses because good business practice and peoples general attitude are so closely linked to good health and safety i often find that i am including elements of your guidance in my conversations i do not just deal with small businesses however  even the world famous cheltenham racecourse and the everyman theatre in cheltenham have benefited from some of your ideas i have also taken many of your suggestions to heart building an impressive though as yet unpublished collection of health and safety hints and tips numbering over three thousand and getting up one hour early every day well nearly every day to write about health and safety matters inspired by your general approach i took the bull by the horns when approached by my local diocese of the church of england last year for a bit of advice on asbestos and landed up writing a detailed guidance manual aimed at helping churchwardens and others to comply with the legislation at considerably lower cost than calling in a professional many of whom are anything but self publishing the manual and attending to its printing and distribution have all stemmed from past items in the achievers edge and have certainly ensured that it was available far more speedily than by other means even if it has entailed a lot more work and all of it in my spare time  time which i would not even have realised was available but for your insights on reflection i wonder why i have never contacted you personally before and have no ready explanation although i have been known to phone your office to check that tapes are on their way from time to time  i must be keen david vosper mcieh peter is a master of his

is sensible he shows you it is all about value to the client not the hourly rate or what you think it worthwhen peter says your fee is too low …listen to him and then take action it is only your
