consolidated financial statements of pervasip  about us  initiatives  pervasip corp  sec filings   comprehensive cannabis analytics extraction and testing in recent years regulations surrounding cannabis have changed dramatically in several states  recreational marijuana use in colorado was legalized effective january   for individuals  and over our goal is to be at the forefront of the analytics extraction and testing process in colorado and to eventually provide those services for cannabis products in other states   commercial and recreational growers are able to obtain superior results when they use scientific analysis and medical marijuana regulations require extensive testing of product prior to reaching patients including potency pesticide residual heavy metal and microbial testing we have developed scientific methods for the analysis of cannabinoids in flowers concentrates and edibles with the use of various instrumentation  we also plan to assist medical marijuana specialty production facilities in order to better regulate calculate proper dosage and understand the importance of consistency in product gardening is a science and growers should not rely solely on the visual information and destructive analysis to determine health and potential yields we believe we possess the knowhow to offer commercial clients the ability to double the yield at approximately  of the cost of other plant enhancement techniques implementation of advanced instrumentation is a major key to efficient operations where plant yields are maximized costs are reduced and impacts on the environment are minimized  we have identified several areas where tremendous opportunity exists for portable chemical sensing instrumentation   pvsp current price volume bid ask
