affected   the patent license agreement attached to the registration statement as exhibit  herein provides the company with the right to market chinese patent no zl the “licensed patent” for a period of five  years beginning on january   however we have not filed for trade mark other patent or copyright protection of our own third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us any future trademark and patent applications may not be approved   in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights   although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights including the use of incryption there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results   we are not currently but in the future could become a party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations   companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various “nonpracticing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies we presently are not involved in any such lawsuits but in the future as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile including in connection with our initial public offering it is possible that patent and other intellectual property claims against could arise in addition from time to time we may introduce new products including in areas where we currently do not compete which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities   although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of intellectual property claims will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   however defending patent and other intellectual property claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees we may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party’s rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result      table of contents   you cannot evaluate our business or our future prospects due to our lack of operating history todate we have been involved in limited business activities potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by development stage companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises in addition there is no guarantee that we will commence full business operations   furthermore we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any significant revenue we therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from selling color panels we will not be able to continue operations   if our president leaves the company prior to securing replacements we will be left without management and our business operations would cease   we depend on the services of our president ping zhou and our success depends on the decisions made by our president the loss of the services of our president could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there is no assurance that our president will not leave the company or compete against us in the future as we presently have no employment agreement with her in such circumstance we may have to recruit qualified personnel with competitive compensation packages equity participation and other benefits that may affect the working capital available for our operations our failure to attract additional qualified employees or to retain the services of our president could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition we will fail without appropriate replacements   although our president is not currently receiving compensation for her services she may decide to pay herself which will adversely impact any potential net profit that we may generate   we are not currently compensating our president for providing management services to us in the future we might pay our president compensation if the cash flow generated from operations significantly exceeds our total expenses our president has the power to set her own compensation as he sees fit if she determines to compensate herself it could have an adverse effect on our net profit if any   the lack of public company experience of our officers and directors could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   our officers and directors have had no responsibility for managing a public company in the united states which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of  such responsibility includes complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis in addition our officers and directors may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner or in a manner which adequately responds to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the

bulletin board however we cannot assure you that our shares will be quoted on the otc bulletin board or if quoted that a public market will materialize   the securities and exchange commission has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the securities and exchange commission that   a contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading b contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws c contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price d contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions e defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks and f contains such other information and is in such

in a penny stock the customer with   a bid and offer quotations for the penny stock b the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction c the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and d a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a suitably written statement   these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock therefore if our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities       table of contents   holders   we had  holder of record of our common stock as of april     securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   we do not have any securities authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans   penny stock regulation   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined of less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share such securities are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell them for transactions covered by these rules the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase additionally for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require the delivery prior to the transaction of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock

declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings if any our capital requirements and financial position general economic conditions and other pertinent conditions it is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but rather to reinvest earnings if any in our business operations   dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders   in this offering the level of dilution is increased as a result of the relatively low book value of yxxs presently issued and outstanding stock this is due to the shares of common stock issued to the companys officers and directors totaling  shares at  per share for  cash and  recorded as a subscription payable versus the current offering price of  per share   the companys net tangible book value on january   was  or approximately  per share based upon  shares

nevada general corporation law permits a corporation to indemnify an officer or director even in the absence of an agreement to do so for expenses incurred in connection with any action or proceeding if such officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and such indemnification is authorized by the stockholders by a quorum of disinterested directors by independent legal counsel in a written opinion authorized by a majority vote of a quorum of directors consisting of disinterested directors or by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of disinterested directors cannot be obtained   the nevada general corporation law prohibits indemnification of a director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that the officers or directors acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct fraud or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action despite the foregoing limitations on indemnification the nevada general corporation law may permit an officer or director to apply to the court for approval of indemnification even if the officer or director is adjudged to have committed intentional misconduct fraud or a knowing violation of the law   the nevada general corporation law also provides that indemnification of directors is not permitted for the unlawful payment of distributions except for those directors registering their dissent to the payment of the distribution   according to article  of our bylaws we

accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   startup costs   in accordance with asc  “ startup costs” the company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the startup and organization of the company   cash   cash includes cash in banks money market funds and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which in the opinion of management are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value   f   table of contents   yi xi xin inc notes to financial statements january     note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “accounting for income taxes” the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized as of january   the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions   fair value measurements the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which  defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable   level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions   the company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis   f   table of contents   yi xi xin inc notes to financial statements january     note   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  the company has not generated any revenues since inception and sustained a net loss of  for the period from inception november   to january   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon among other things its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts   the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note   income taxes   the reconciliation of income tax benefit at the us statutory rate of  for the period from inception to january   to the company’s effective tax rate is as follows   income tax expense at statutory rate      change in valuation allowance        income tax expense                                         the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the company’s net deferred tax assets as of december   are as follows           net operating loss       valuation allowance       net deferred tax asset                                        the company has approximately  of net operating losses “nol” carried forward to offset taxable income if any in future years which expire commencing in fiscal  in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be     realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based on the assessment management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to nols for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized   f   table of contents   yi xi xin inc notes to financial statements january     note  – stockholder’s equity     since inception november   the
