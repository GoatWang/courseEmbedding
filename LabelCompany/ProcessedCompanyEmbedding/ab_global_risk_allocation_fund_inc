statistics are shown for class a shares only unless otherwise noted; other classes may have different characteristics you can lose money by investing in the fund any investment in the fund should be part of an overall investment program rather than a complete program all mutual funds are subject to market risk including possible loss of principal because the fund is a fundoffunds an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks of the exchange traded products in which it invests including but not limited to risks associated with smaller companies foreign securities emerging markets debt securities commodities and derivatives the fund will bear its share of the fees and expenses of the exchangetraded products consequently an investment in the fund entails more direct and indirect expenses than a direct investment in an exchangetraded product because the fund invests in exchangetraded products it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds including the risks that the market price of an exchangetraded products shares may be higher or lower than the value of its underlying assets there may be a lackof liquidity in the shares of the exchangetraded product or trading may be halted by the exchange on which they trade principal risks of investing in foreign securities include changes in currency rates foreign taxation and

of the portfolio’s holdings rise and fall from day to day so investments may lose value interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices fall and vice versa―longterm securities tend to rise and fall more than shortterm securities the values of mortgagerelated and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk credit risk a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal―the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline allocation risk allocating to different types of assets may have a large impact on returns if one of these asset classes significantly underperforms the others foreign nonus risk nonus securities may be more volatile because of political regulatory market and economic uncertainties associated with such securities fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the investment or reduce returns these risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets derivatives risk investing in derivative instruments such as options futures forwards or swaps can be riskier than traditional investments and may be more volatile especially in a down market leverage risk trying to enhance investment returns by borrowing money or using other leverage tools―magnify both gains and losses resulting in greater volatility below investment grade securities risk investments in fixedincome securities with lower ratings commonly known as “junk bonds” tend to have a higher probability that an issuer will default or fail to meet its payment obligations investors should consider the investment objectives
