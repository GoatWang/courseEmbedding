reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bcg cannot be ruled out adverse reactions symptoms of bladder irritability related to the inflammatory response induced are reported in approximately  of patients receiving tice® bcg the symptoms typically begin  to  hours after instillation and last  to  hours the irritative side effects are usually seen following the third instillation and tend to increase in severity after each administration the irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed symptomatically with products such as pyridium propantheline bromide oxybutynin chloride and acetaminophen the mechanism of action of the irritative side effects has not been firmly established but is most consistent with an immunological mechanism there is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of tice bcg flulike symptoms malaise fever and chills which may accompany the localized irritative toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically antihistamines have also been used adverse reactions to tice bcg tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with subsequent instillation delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation although uncommon serious infectious complications of intravesical bcg have been reported the most serious infectious complication of bcg is disseminated sepsis with associated mortality in addition m bovis infections have been reported in lung liver bone bone marrow kidney regional lymph nodes and prostate in patients who have received intravesical bcg systemic infections may be manifested by pneumonitis hepatitis cytopenia infective aneurysm andor sepsis after a period of fever and malaise during which symptoms progressively increase some male genitourinary tract infections orchitisepididymitis have been resistant to multipledrug antituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy if a patient develops persistent fever or experiences an acute febrile illness consistent with bcg infection bcg treatment should be discontinued and the patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic infection see warnings the local

of active local or systemic bcg infection for acute local or systemic reactions suggesting active infection an infectious disease specialist experienced in bcg complications should be consulted tice bcg dosage and administration the dose for the intravesical treatment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papillary tumors consists of  vial of tice® bcg suspended in  ml preservativefree saline do not inject subcutaneously or intravenously preparation of agent the preparation of the tice bcg suspension should be done using aseptic technique to avoid crosscontamination parenteral drugs should not be prepared in areas where bcg has been prepared a separate area for the preparation of the tice bcg suspension is recommended all equipment supplies and receptacles in contact with tice bcg should be handled and disposed of as biohazardous the pharmacist or individual responsible for mixing the agent should wear gloves and take precautions to avoid contact of bcg with broken skin if preparation cannot be performed in a biocontainment hood then a mask and gown should be worn to avoid inhalation of bcg organisms and inadvertent exposure to broken skin draw  ml of sterile preservativefree saline  sodium chloride injection usp at –°c into a small syringe eg  ml and add to  vial of tice bcg to resuspend gently swirl the vial until a homogenous suspension is obtained avoid forceful agitation which may cause clumping of the mycobacteria dispense the cloudy tice bcg suspension into the top end of a cathetertip syringe which contains  ml of saline diluent bringing the total volume to  ml to mix gently rotate the syringe the reconstituted tice bcg should be kept refrigerated –°c protected from exposure to direct sunlight and used within  hours unused solution should be discarded after  hours note do not filter the contents of the tice bcg vial precautions should be taken to avoid exposing the tice bcg to direct sunlight bacteriostatic solutions must be avoided in addition use only sterile preservativefree saline  sodium chloride injection usp as diluent treatment and schedule allow  to  days to elapse after bladder biopsy before tice bcg is administered patients should not drink fluids for  hours before treatment and should empty their bladder prior to tice bcg administration the reconstituted tice bcg is instilled into the bladder by gravity flow via the catheter do not depress plunger and force the flow of the tice bcg the tice bcg is retained in the bladder  hours and then voided patients unable to retain the suspension for  hours should be allowed to void sooner if necessary while the bcg is retained in the bladder the patient ideally should be repositioned from left side to right side and also should lie upon the back and the abdomen changing these positions every  minutes to maximize bladder surface exposure to the agent a standard treatment schedule consists of  intravesical instillation per week for  weeks this schedule may be repeated once if tumor remission has not been achieved and if the clinical circumstances warrant thereafter intravesical tice bcg administration should continue at approximately monthly intervals for at least  to  months there are no data to support the interchangeability of bcg live products how is tice bcg supplied tice® bcg is supplied in a box of  vial of tice bcg each vial contains  to  ×  cfu which is equivalent to approximately  mg wet weight as lyophilized freezedried powder ndc  storage the intact vials of tice® bcg should be stored refrigerated at –°c –°f this agent contains live bacteria and should be protected from direct sunlight the product should not be used after the expiration date printed on the label references dejager r guinan p lamm d khanna o

clock are there two more loaded words in all of hifi for those too young to know in  an audio manufacturer named george tice brought to market a  accessory that could improve the sound of any domestic music system simply by being connected to an ac outlet in the same roomor so he claimed but the claim was incredible because the product appeared to be nothing more than a rebadged radioshack digital alarm clock to which an invisible proprietary treatment had been applied stereophile borrowed and tested various samples of the tice clock and although one writer said he might have heard a very slight effect editor john atkinson summed up our coverage by stating that not only did the clock fail to perform as advertised but george tices technical explanations for it had no basis in scientific fact thomas j norton stereophiles technical editor at the time added that the tice clock was identical inside and out to a  radioshack alarm clockto the naked eye an amusing side note the tice clock was also one of the grains of sand around which professional skeptic james randi oozed the pearl of his famously clever exposé of our hobby as randi stated on his website the tate clock    is only one of the items stereophile tested and approved john atkinson and i both noted publicly that not only did randi get the products name wrongan indication that this debunker of mindreaders thinks he can glean information from the printed page without actually having to readbut he misstated our review conclusions by a statistically significant ° randi responded with as much worldweary canyoubelievethesefruitcakes condescension as he could muster decrying our pettiness for even mentioning his typoand of course ignoring completely the matter of his false report of our review conclusions as i said clever footnote  field day back to the plot whenever alternative science is evoked in an attempt to explain the technological workings of an audio component or tweakmore often than not its the latter of coursewe of the press would do well to remember laffaire tice and heres why even though stereophile reported truthfully that the tice clock was inadequate to every task except reporting the time of day there remain those who believe we committed a journalistic sin by reporting on it at all so it goes i guess for any of us who would report on the products of quantum resonant technology of santa monica california which i mentioned in last months listening column the companys qx audio accessory  is remarkable for two things its use in a goodquality system has a consistently audible effectmusic recordings sound notably and consistently clearer bigger more open and more naturally detailedand qrts explanation of the technological basis of that effect is unsatisfying the former puts the qx in an altogether higher nobler plane than the tice clock but the latter still bugs me in a nutshell qrt describes the qx as a scalar field generator that uses technology derived from quantum mechanics to provide ordering and stabilization of magnetic field effects the company also says the qx isnt a filter of any sort and thus does not impede current delivery in the slightest the latter is certainly true the qx places nothing but electrical contacts and heavygauge wires in line with the household current but if the task that it doesnt perform is clear the one that it does perform remains cloaked in mystery i wont pretend i understand quantum physics better than anyone else whose postcollegiate science education is limited to reading national geographic at the dentists office but it seems to me that anyone who can design and manufacture a useful practical household generator of scalar fields would have been kidnapped by the cia by now and put to work building superweapons as were enrico fermi wernher von braun and tony stark that a marginal industry such as ours can attract so many people who have successfully farted at the laws of physics never ceases to amaze me the skepticism with which i regard quantum rts official explanation footnote  also comes from having looked inside one of their qxs apart from the expected powersupply components the qxs single circuit board contained four discrete transistors one voltage regulator four very small capacitors six resistors one crystal four coils and an pin chip of indeterminate function that chip and most of the other parts were obscured by a coating of something hard dark and opaque not that this means anything but i have owned and repaired wahwah pedals of greater apparent complexity having said all that the quantum qx works not only does it provide one of the most clearly audible performance differences ive heard from a noncable accessory its effect has been documented in a series of laboratory differential tests conducted by acuity products of east sussex england wwwacuityproductscouk i dont think its a consumer magazines place to publish a manufacturers test graphics within the course of a report any more than its our place to copy a product description word for word from a promotional brochure but you can see acuitys results for yourself on the internet and yes they appear quite remarkable i have on hand four samples of the qx the most effective being the two that are dedicated to my pair of audio note ane speakers the others when i use them at all are adjacent to my preamp and to the ac outlet strip that powers my system according to roy gregory of nordost corpnordost distributes quantum products in the usqxs positioned directly above or below a conventional loudspeaker control the stray electromagnetic fields given off by and perhaps reflected back at the motor of each dynamic driver in light of that explanation i couldnt help thinking of the qx as an active version of the altogether passive vpi db aka the vpi brick scarcely a week has gone by when ive failed to amuse myself or others by switching those two qxs on and off and listening for the difference this morning in fact i invited my wife to play that game i plugged the ac cords of the two speakermounted qxs into the same switchable heavyduty outlet strip then sat on the floor between the speakers the outlet strip in my lap and my back toward the main listening seat i played one of janets current fave albumsleonard cohens live in london cd sony an aiff copy of which ive ripped to my imacand asked her to let me know whenever it seemed that i might have done something to change the sound overall and to try to describe the change in her own words as well as to tell me whether she thought it was a change for the better or for the worse footnote  im being unfair james randi did in fact put me in my place with a witheringly funny illustration of a sera cartoon character named dudley doright i have hesitated to even think of the great man since then in apprehension of the even more clever taunts that would surely ensue footnote  scalar field sounds scientific but all it means is that any particular property is not associated with a specific direction temperature for example is a scalar field whereas magnetic and electric fields are not because they are directional you can read my thoughts on the misappropriation of scientific terms herejohn atkinson next page  » article contents page  page  contacts log in or register to post comments
