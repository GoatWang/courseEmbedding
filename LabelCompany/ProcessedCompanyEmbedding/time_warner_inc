tmobile by tara lachapelle photographer chris goodneybloomberg tech tara lachapelle tara lachapelle is a bloomberg gadfly columnist covering deals she previously wrote an ma column for bloomberg news follow taralach facebook twitter email print share july    pm edt time warner inc  at closing july st  usd tmobile us inc  at closing july st  usd tmobile us inc accomplished what it set out to trounce sprint corp and ruffle feathers at the once unrivaled wireless leaders verizon communications inc and att inc now investors should start to see a more mature tmobile  even if magentatshirtwearing ceo john legere still boisterously nags his starchy rivals in the twittersphere the little engine that could is entering the next phase of its transformation and that means growth in both subscribers and its stock price will be tougher to come by tmobiles secondquarter results after wednesdays close of trading may yet be good with analysts estimating adjusted earnings jumped  percent to  cents a share as revenue increased  percent to  billion but tmobiles stock which has more than quadrupled in five years has recently started to hit speed bumps options trading ahead of earnings imply investors are tempering their expectations bloomberg markets reporter gregory calderone notes that the potential average gain implied by the most popular contracts is less than the historical average as puts congregate around the  to  level tmobile shares were selling for  apiece midday wednesday  meeting resistance tmobiles stock topped out in june as the wireless carrier confronts new growth challenges source bloomberg this doesnt detract from whats been an impressive strategy by legere who seems to enjoy making it look more impromptu than it probably was its all part of tmobiles cool factor which he brought to the brand even if it does at times induce eye rolls not for nothing tmobile was able to steal sprints spot as the no  player in the industry then force att and verizon to cave by offering unlimited data plans growth slog tmobiles postpaid subscriber net additions probably declined in the second quarter as its competitors began offering unlimited data plans source bloomberg theres also a marked difference in how tmobile went about this versus sprints approach sprint is offering customers a year of free service if they make a switch which does more to highlight sprints desperation than present a substantial threat to the other carriers this table created by bloomberg intelligence analysts shows how tmobile is being competitive while sprint just looks sad going unlimited while tmobile verizon and att are in a price war over unlimited data plans sprint went all out  free for new customers through july  if they sign up this month source company websites bloomberg intelligence note sprint verizon and att dont include taxes and fees in their rates while tmobile does but now that the easy subscriber wins have been made tmobiles attention should turn to improving its coverage there are signs that the company is doing this bloomberg intelligence notes that tmobile ended a promotion that offered customers two lines for the price of one and increased the charge for hd video it also outbid every other company in the spectrum auction earlier this year spending  billion to narrow its gap with att and verizonstep  get customersstep  keep themregardless of whether tmobile merges with sprint or another party other possible candidates here it needs to work on consumers perception that its service isnt great that means adding new subscribers from here will get more costly a challenge for a company that already has tighter margins than its bigger rivals  and those bigger rivals are only getting more powerful att may not be growing but it will have more enticing offerings once it closes the acquisition of time warner inc verizon is also clearly on the hunt to join forces with a big media company  margin compression tmobile has strategically sacrificed profits for growth but it will be a larger tradeoff going forward as stealing subscribers becomes more costly source bloomberg tmobile has had quite a run but to impress investors from here will be more difficult this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of bloomberg lp and its owners to contact the author of this story tara lachapelle in new york

acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who

in a longexpected deal warner communications announced on may   they were acquiring lorimartelepictures the acquisition was finalized on january   the merger of time inc and warner communications was announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern launched a  billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who eventually became ceo of time warner described the  merger with aol as the biggest mistake in

in a longexpected deal warner communications announced on may   they were acquiring lorimartelepictures the acquisition was finalized on january   the merger of time inc and warner communications was announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern launched a  billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who eventually became ceo of time warner described the  merger with aol as the biggest mistake in

announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern launched a  billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name

in a longexpected deal warner communications announced on may   they were acquiring lorimartelepictures the acquisition was finalized on january   the merger of time inc and warner communications was announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern launched a  billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who eventually became ceo of time warner described the  merger with aol as the biggest mistake in corporate history in  time warner was among  entities that contributed the maximum of  to the second inauguration of president george w bush on december   newly installed time warner ceo jeffrey

in a longexpected deal warner communications announced on may   they were acquiring lorimartelepictures the acquisition was finalized on january   the merger of time inc and warner communications was announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern launched a  billion hostile bid to acquire time inc in an attempt to end a stockswap merger deal between time and warner communications this caused time to raise its bid for warner to  billion in cash and stock paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a delaware court to block the timewarner merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman

merger the court ruled twice in favor of time forcing paramount to drop both the time acquisition and the lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january

warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known as time warner communications also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the

merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who eventually became ceo of time warner described the  merger with aol as the biggest mistake in corporate history in  time warner was among  entities that contributed the maximum of  to the second inauguration of president george w bush on december   newly installed time warner ceo jeffrey

under the atc name in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses us west also took a  stake in the entertainment portion of the company calling that division time warner entertainment or legally time warner entertainment company lp us wests stake eventually passed to acquired cable company mediaone then to att broadband in  when that company acquired mediaone then finally to comcast in  when that company bought the att broadband division comcast sold their stake in the company in  relegating the name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner president in  although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and ceo gerald levin in  hbo and cinemax became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers with companion channels supplementing the main networks in  hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service in  cnn introduced cnncom which later became a leading destination for global digital news both online and mobile in  warner bros spearheaded the introduction of the dvd which rapidly replaced vhs tapes as the standard for home video in  hbo became the first national cable tv network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel sedit merger with aoledit in  it was announced that aol would purchase time warner for us billion due to the larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name

acquisition was finalized on january   the merger of time inc and warner communications was announced on march   during the summer of that same year paramount communications formerly gulfwestern

lawsuit and allowing the formation of the two companies merger which was completed on january   however instead of the companies becoming defunct the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure resulting in the new company being called time warner sedit us west partnered with time warner in  to form what is now known as tw telecom initially known

name to a subdivision under time warner cable time warner subsequently acquired ted turners turner broadcasting system in october  not only did this result in the company in a way reentering the basic cable television industry in regards to nationally available channels but warner bros also regained the rights to their pre film library which by then had been owned by turner the films are still technically held by turner but wb is responsible for sales and distribution while turner gained access to wbs post library as well as other wbowned properties time warner purchased the six flags theme parks chain in  the company later sold all six flags parks and properties to oklahomabased premier parks on april   dick parsons already a director on the board since  was hired as time warner

larger market capitalization of aol their shareholders would own  of the new company while time warner shareholders owned only  so in actual practice aol had acquired time warner even though time warner had far more assets and revenues time warner had been looking for a way to embrace the digital revolution while aol wanted to convert its stock price into tangible assets the deal announced on january   and officially filed on february   employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity the federal trade commission cleared the deal on december   and gave final approval on january   the company completed the merger later that day the deal was approved on the same day by the federal communications commission and had already been cleared by the european commission on october   aol time warner inc as the company was then called was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides gerald levin who had served as chairman and ceo of time warner was ceo of the new company steve case served as executive chairman of the board of directors robert w pittman president and coo of aol and dick parsons president of time warner served as cochief operating officers and j michael kelly the cfo from aol became the chief financial officer according to aol president and coo bob pittman the slowmoving time warner would now take off at internet speed accelerated by aol all you need to do is put a catalyst to time warner and in a short period you can alter the growth rate the growth rate will be like an internet company when the aol time warner deal was announced the vision for its future seemed clear and straightforward by tapping into aol time warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers aol would use time warners highspeed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers time warners branded magazines books music and movies this would have created  million subscription relationships unfortunately the growth and profitability of the aol division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high speed broadband providers the value of the america online division dropped significantly not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell and forced a goodwill writeoff causing aol time warner to report a loss of  billion in  — at the time the largest loss ever reported by a company the total value of aol stock subsequently went from  billion to about  billion an outburst by vice chairman ted turner at a board meeting prompted steve case to contact each of the directors and push for ceo gerald levins ouster although cases coup attempt was rebuffed by parsons and several other directors levin became frustrated with being unable to regain the rhythm at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of  effective in may  although cocoo bob pittman was the strongest supporter of levin and largely seen as the heirapparent dick parsons was instead chosen as ceo time warner cfo j michael kelly was demoted to coo of the aol division and replaced as cfo by wayne pace aol chairman and ceo barry schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new content creation division being replaced on an interim basis by pittman who was already serving as the sole coo after parsons promotion many expected synergies between aol and other time warner divisions never materialized as most time warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger a new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of aol time warner replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division caused resentment among time warner division heads who blamed the aol division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company aol time warner coo pittman who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives who also criticized pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for aol time warner that were never met some of the attacks on pittman were reported to come from the print media in the time inc division under don logan furthermore ceo parsons democratic style prevented pittman from exercising authority over the oldguard division heads who resisted pittmans synergy initiatives pittman announced his resignation as aol time warner coo after july   being reportedly burned out by the aol special assignment and almost hospitalized unhappy about the criticism from time warner executives and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as parsons was firmly entrenched as ceo pittmans departure was seen as a great victory to time warner executives who wanted to undo the merger in a sign of aols diminishing importance to the media conglomerate pittmans responsibilities were divided between two time warner veterans jeffrey bewkes who was ceo of home box office and don logan who had been ceo of time logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group overseeing america online time time warner cable the aol time warner book group and the interactive video unit relegating aol to being just another division in the conglomerate bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group comprising hbo new line cinema the wb turner networks warner bros and warner music both logan and bewkes who had initially opposed the merger were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to aol time warner ceo richard parsons logan generally admired at time warner and reviled by aol for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker moved to purge aol of several pittman panzers aol time warner chairman steve case took on added prominence as the cohead of a new strategy committee of the board making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the internet however under pressure from institutional investor vice president gordon crawford who lined up dissenters case announced in january  that he would not stand for reelection as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting making ceo richard parsons the chairmanelect that year the company dropped the aol from its name and spun off timelifes ownership under the legal name direct holdings americas inc case resigned from the time warner board on october   jeff bewkes who
