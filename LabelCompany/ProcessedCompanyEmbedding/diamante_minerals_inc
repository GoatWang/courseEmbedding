that may be produced per month at petaquilla minerals ltd’s molejon gold mine located in donoso district colon province republic of panama our royalty right is contingent on our advancing to blendcore llc as borrower and as the operator of certain proposed operations at the molejon gold mine the final tranche of a loan in the total principal amount of  the funds are to be advanced in accordance with a budget for the restart of processing of stockpiled ore at the mine which has been annexed to the loan agreement dated january   among our company blendcore and petaquilla minerals’ subsidiary petaquilla gold sa as of january   our company had advanced  to blendcore under the loan agreement subsequent to our advancing the monies to blendcore progress has been slow in advancing the restart separate and apart from the issues arising with respect to the loan to blendcore we have engaged a law firm in panama to pursue the acquisition of the molejon gold mine representatives of this firm are in discussions with a committee formed by the panamanian government to oversee the transfer of interests of the molejon gold mine   valuation of derivative   as the loan agreement with blendcore contains a royalty component there is an embedded derivative in its value currently the company has elected to account for the entire instrument as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value presented in earnings the fair value of the derivative is determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis related to various expected future cash flows to be received based on weighted probabilities due to the uncertainty of the potential royalty streams this asset is classified as a level  asset within the fair value hierarchy as our valuation estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs including estimates as to the probability and timing of future gold production transaction related fees and costs are expensed as incurred   the changes in the estimated fair value from the derivative along with cash receipts each reporting period are presented together on the statement of operations as a component of revenue under the caption “derivative – change in fair value”   allowance for doubtful account   at present the gold mine has not been restarted the company has engaged the services of a legal firm in panama to determine appropriate title to the claim and our course of action to receive the funds advanced as such an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the amount of the loan has been recorded in the books for the year ended july   no adjustment has been made and the allowance still stands as of january     note   going concern and liquidity considerations   the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that the

operations through equity financing arrangements which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending july     the ability of the company to emerge from the exploration stage is dependent upon among other things obtaining additional financing to continue operations and development of its business plan in response to these problems management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a

ceo and the cfo under their respective employment agreements in the prior period management fees were comprised of the amounts issued with no resulting decrease professional fees during these periods have increased due to additional legal costs related to the blendcore loan as well as additional legal and accounting costs for the filing of our registration statement on form s under the securities

is located in the state of mato grosso in westcentral brazil approximately  kilometers northeast of cuiaba the state capital click to enlarge   the batovi diamond project is accessible from cuiaba by main and secondary roads one would travel east from cuiaba on paved road br  kilometers to primavera do leste before heading  kilometers north on partially paved road mt to paranatinga an allweather gravel road connects paranatinga to the project area which lies  kilometers to the north   in addition paranatinga has an airport that is suitable for charter aircraft        table of contents   currently there is no plant or equipment on the project site   in brazil exploration licenses are issued by the director general of the departamento nacional de produção mineral translated as the national department of mineral production and referred to in this quarterly report as the “dnpm” an exploration license is granted for an initial term of up to three years and can be renewed once if the license holder submits an interim report on the exploration work completed to date which justifies further exploration   an annual exploration fee must be paid to the dnpm to keep an exploration license in good standing the exploration fee is assessed at the rate of r per hectare for each year during the initial term of the license and at the rate of r per hectare for each year during the renewal term mineracao batovi has provided documentation to us evidencing that its exploration licenses comprising the batovi diamond project are in good standing   the batovi diamond project represents an opportunity for the potential discovery of primary diamond bearing kimberlite intrusives due diligence documents provided by mineraco batovi confirm that the general area is host to over  known kimberlite intrusives which were discovered by debeers and rio tinto who explored the area between  to about  historically a number of the kimberlites were evaluated as possible sources of large high quality alluvial diamonds found in the area in small artisanal alluvial mining operations although limited testing of the discovered kimberlites returned a few small stones from some of the kimberlites they were generally not found to be significantly diamondiferous this suggests that diamond bearing kimberlites which are the source of the large alluvial diamonds found in the project area have yet to be discovered   mineracao batovi has followed up this historic work with limited exploration activities at a cost of approximately cdn million and has identified possible individual diamond indicator mineral trains on the property   since we have not funded the  payment required to be made to mineracao batovi in order to acquire our initial  equity interest in the batovi diamond project we are not in a position to assume our duties as the operator as contemplated by the joint venture agreement however if we are able to fund such  or an adequate portion of this we anticipate that a majority of the proceeds will be applied to fund exploration work aimed at defining the potential source kimberlites of the indicator mineral trains   typically geophysical surveys are used to locate potential kimberlites geophysical surveys measure the physical properties of the rocks below them it is hoped that the kimberlites would have contrasting physical properties to the surrounding rocks the proposed geophysical survey would detect both the conductivity and magnetic signature of the underlying rocks it is expected that the kimberlites would differ from the surrounding host rocks in terms of these physical properties   if we earn our initial  equity interest in mineracao batovi and assume our role as the operator of the project we anticipate that our first step will be to commission an airborne electromagnetic geophysical survey over certain areas preliminarily identified by mineracao batovi as having the potential to host diamond bearing kimberlites mobilizing an airborne survey system to the project area could take a couple of months after execution of the survey contract the airborne survey itself should take less than a month thereafter the survey data will have to be extensively manipulated to allow its use we anticipate that such analytical manipulation would require one to two months to complete we estimate that the airborne survey will cost approximately    any priority targets identified by the airborne survey will need to be tested likely by drilling the length and scope of any such drill program – and the appropriate drill and associated equipment required  will depend on the nature and number of targets but we anticipate that it would likely take several months to complete until the results of the geophysical survey are complete it is difficult to ascertain what the cost of this target testing phase will be but we estimate that the initial round of drilling will likely cost between  to         table of contents   any future work would be contingent upon the initial round of testing generating positive results should a kimberlite be discovered with potentially economic diamond content we expect that the next phases of work would be delineation drilling followed by bulk sampling and if warranted a feasibility study   the batovi diamond project is centered on the perennial batovi river it is conceivable that this would provide a water source for any future operations we have not investigated what steps would be required or what arrangements will have to be made to secure water rights   there is currently no power grid at the project area if future exploration activities justify development at the project site which will give rise to substantial power requirements diesel generators will have to be installed or arrangements will have to be made to fund the extension of the power grid from paranatinga which is located  kilometers to the south of the project area   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   our exposure to market risks includes but is not necessarily limited to equity price risk commodity price risk foreign currency risk and country risk   equity price risk   we are subject to market risk related to the market price of our common stock which trades over the counter on the otcqb historically we have relied upon equity financings from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future as a result there is risk that we may not be able to complete an equity financing at an acceptable price when required   commodity price risk   we may in the future be subject to market risk related to the market price of rough diamonds which are priced per carat and gold which is priced per ounce however at january   we had only a minor interest in the batovi diamond project   and the royalty period on petaquilla gold’s molejon gold mine project had not yet begun accordingly fluctuations in the market price of rough diamonds or gold do not currently have a direct impact on our operations   foreign currency risk   we are subject to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations our functional currency is the united states dollar however a portion of our business is transacted in the canadian dollar and if we acquire an interest in mineracao batovi we expect that a significant portion of our business will be transacted in the brazilian real to date foreign exchange currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our results of operations we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure to manage our foreign currency fluctuation risk   country risk   we are subject to market risk related to our operations in foreign jurisdictions we are party to an amended and restated joint venture agreement with mineracao batovi dated january   which contemplates our company acquiring an interest in mineracao batovi to develop finance and operate the batovi diamond project in brazil we have also entered into

report we are unaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on us you could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties   risks related to our company and business        table of contents   evaluating our future performance may be difficult since we are a shell company with negative cash flow and accumulated deficit to date   we have entered into an amended and restated joint venture agreement dated january   pursuant to which we are required to contribute  in cash on or before june   to mineracao batovi ltda a brazilian company which holds the mineral claims underlying the batovi diamond project in return for a  equity interest in mineracao batovi we currently hold a  equity interest however we are a shell company as such term is defined in rule  under the securities act of  as amended and since our inception on october   through january   we have incurred a net loss of  as a result of our limited financial and operating history including our negative cash flow and net losses to date it may be difficult to evaluate our future performance   t here is no assurance that we will be successful in securing financing and substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue our operations over the next twelve months   the continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate financing we anticipate that we will need  to fund the next  months of our operations however given our limited financial and operating history and our status as a shell company there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of financing accordingly substantial doubt exists as to whether we will be able to continue our operations over the next twelve months   even if we are successful in acquiring our initial interest in mineracao batovi our reliance on equity financings is expected to continue and t here is no assurance that such financing will be available when required   even if we are successful in acquiring our initial interest in mineracao batovi our reliance on equity financings is expected to continue for the foreseeable future and the availability of such financing will be dependent on many factors beyond our control including but not limited to the market price of diamonds the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price and the status of the worldwide economy any one of which may cause significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing including access to the equity and credit markets   diamond exploration and mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ significantly from expectations or anticipated amounts furthermore exploration programs conducted on the batovi diamond project may not result in the establishment of ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable diamonds    diamond exploration and mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and uncertainties many beyond our control including but not limited to i unanticipated ground and water conditions ii unusual or unexpected geological formations iii the occurrence of unusual weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events iv lower than expected ore grades v industrial accidents vi delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits vii delays in transportation viii availability of contractors and labor ix government permit restrictions and regulation restrictions x unavailability of materials and equipment and xi the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations these risks and uncertainties could result in delays reductions or stoppages in exploration or development work and any future mining activities increased capital andor extraction costs damage to or destruction of the batovi diamond project extraction facilities or other properties personal injuries environmental damage monetary losses and legal claims        table of contents   success in diamond exploration and gold mining is dependent on many factors including without limitation the experience and capabilities of a company’s management the availability of geological expertise and the availability of sufficient funds to conduct the exploration program even if an exploration program is successful and commercially recoverable diamond or goldbearing ore bodies are established it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling and identification of the mineralization until extraction is possible during which time the economic feasibility of extraction may change such that the diamonds cease to be economically recoverable   diamond exploration is frequently nonproductive due for example to poor exploration results or the inability to establish ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable diamonds in which case the project may be abandoned and writtenoff furthermore mineracao batovi will not be able to benefit from exploration efforts and recover the expenditures that are incurred on exploration programs if mineracao batovi does not establish ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable diamonds and develop the batovi diamond project into profitable mining activities and there is no assurance that mineracao batovi will be successful in doing so   whether an ore body contains commercially recoverable diamonds depends on many factors including without limitation i the particular attributes including material changes to those attributes of the ore body such as size grade recovery rates and proximity to infrastructure ii the market price of diamonds which may be volatile and iii government regulations and regulatory requirements including without limitation those relating to environmental protection permitting and land use taxes land tenure and transportation   in regards to the loan agreement with blendcore and petaquilla gold our company bears the risk that production will not recover sufficient quantities of gold to cover the repayment of the loan in either the initial royalty term or if needed the extended royalty term the loan has been guaranteed by the title holder of the property and is secured by a first charge over that portion of stock piled ore on the title holder’s mine site should the agreement reach this point our company would bear the risks of having to process the stock piled ore including without limitation i the particular attributes including material changes to those attributes of the stock pile such as recovery rates and ability to procure infrastructure to process it ii the market price of gold which may be volatile and iii government regulations and regulatory requirements including without limitation those relating to environmental protection taxes land tenure and transportation   we do not insure against all of the risks we face in our operations   in general where coverage is available and not prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risk we will maintain insurance against such risk subject to exclusions and limitations we currently maintain insurance against certain risks including general commercial liability claims and certain physical assets used in our operations subject to exclusions and limitations however we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks and hazards associated with our operations  we may be subject to liability for environmental pollution or other hazards associated with our or mineracao batovi’s exploration activities which we may not be insured against which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or which we may elect not to insure against because of high premiums or other reasons furthermore we cannot provide assurance that any insurance coverage we currently have will continue to be available at reasonable premiums or that such insurance will adequately cover any resulting liability   mineracao batovi holds mineral rights in brazil a foreign jurisdiction which could be subject to additional risks due to political taxation economic and cultural factors   our business plan contemplates our acquisition of an initial  equity interest in mineracao batovi a company incorporated in brazil operations in foreign jurisdictions outside of the us especially in developing countries may be subject to additional risks as they may have different political regulatory taxation economic and cultural environments that may adversely affect the value or continued viability of our rights these additional risks include but are not limited to i changes in governments or senior government officials ii changes to existing laws or policies on foreign investments environmental protection mining and ownership of mineral interests iii renegotiation cancellation expropriation and nationalization of existing permits or contracts iv foreign currency controls and fluctuations and v civil disturbances terrorism and war        table of contents   in the event of a dispute arising from our anticipated future involvement in the batovi diamond project we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states or canada we may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing our rights with respect to a government entity or instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity any adverse or arbitrary decision of a foreign court may have a material and adverse impact on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations   the title to mineracao batovi’s mineral property interests may be challenged   although we have undertaken reasonable due diligence to confirm that mineracao batovi has taken reasonable measures to ensure proper title to its interests in the batovi diamond project and other assets there is no guarantee that the title to any of such interests will not be challenged no assurance can be given that mineracao will be able to secure the grant or the renewal of existing mineral rights and tenures on terms satisfactory to it or that governments in the jurisdictions in which it operates will not revoke or significantly alter such rights or tenures or that such rights or tenures will not be challenged or impugned by third parties including local governments aboriginal peoples or other claimants mineracao batovi’s mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements transfers or claims and title may be affected by among other things undetected defects a successful challenge to the precise area and location of mineracao batovi’s claims could result in it being unable to explore or operate on its properties as permitted or being unable to enforce its rights with respect to its properties   we depend on certain key personnel and our success will depend on our continued ability to retain and attract such qualified personnel   our success is dependent on the efforts abilities and continued service of certain senior officers and key employees and consultants a loss of service from any one of these individuals may adversely affect our operations and we may have difficulty or may not be able to locate and hire a suitable replacement   certain directors and officers may be subject to conflicts of interest   our sole director and our officers are involved in other business ventures including similar capacities with other private or publiclytraded companies such individuals may have significant responsibilities to these other business ventures including consulting relationships which may require significant amounts of their available time conflicts of interest may include decisions on how much time to devote to our business affairs and what business opportunities should be presented to us   the laws of the state of nevada and our articles of incorporation may protect our directors and officers from certain types of lawsuits   the laws of the state of nevada provide that our sole director and officers will not be liable to the company or its stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors and officers of the company our bylaws provide for broad indemnification powers to all persons against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law these indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims and may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors and officers caused by their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances        table of contents   our sole director and our officers are residents outside of the us and it may be difficult for stockholders to enforce within the us any judgments obtained against such director or officers   our sole director and our officers are nationals andor residents of countries other than the us and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside of the us as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on such director and officers or enforce within the us any judgments obtained against such director and officers including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the us or any state thereof consequently stockholders may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies against such director and officers under us federal securities laws in addition stockholders may not be able to commence an action in a canadian court predicated upon the civil liability provisions under us federal securities laws   our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are not effective in any event disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting no matter how well designed and operated are designed to obtain reasonable and not absolute assurance as to its reliability and effectiveness   management’s evaluation on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures is designed to ensure that information required for disclosure in our public filings is recorded processed summarized and reported on a timely basis to our senior management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly authorized assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and transactions are properly recorded and reported our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were ineffective as of the end of our fiscal year ended july   and as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report in any event any system of controls no matter how well designed and operated is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable and not absolute assurance as to its reliability and effectiveness our failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures may result in our inability to continue meeting our reporting obligations in a timely manner qualified audit opinions or restatements of our financial reports any one of which may affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets   risks related to our common stock   brokerdealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our common shares because they are considered a penny stock and are subject to the penny stock rules this could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares   our common stock currently constitutes “penny stock” subject to certain exceptions for the purposes relevant to us “penny stock” includes any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or with an exercise price of less than  per share rules g through g promulgated under the united states securities exchange act of  as amended impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on certain brokersdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a “penny stock” in particular a brokerdealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor” generally an individual with net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  together with his or her spouse must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt a brokerdealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities finally a brokerdealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer’s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks        table of contents   the additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon brokerdealers may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our shares which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market   in the event that an investment in our shares is for the purpose of deriving dividend income or in expectation of an increase in market price of our shares from the declaration and payment of dividends the investment will be compromised because we do not intend to pay dividends   we have never paid a dividend to our shareholders and we intend to retain our cash for the continued development of our business accordingly we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future as a result a return on investment will be solely determined by the ability to sell the shares in the secondary market   historically the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to fluctuate significantly   our stock is thinly traded and trading in our stock is volatile in addition the global markets generally have experienced significant and increased volatility in the past and have been impacted by the effects of mass subprime mortgage defaults and liquidity problems of the assetbacked commercial paper market resulting in a number of large financial institutions requiring government bailouts or filing for bankruptcy the effects of these past events and any similar events in the future may continue to or further affect the global markets which may directly affect the market price of our common stock and our accessibility for additional financing although this volatility may be unrelated to specific company performance it can have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares which historically has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future   in addition to the volatility associated with general economic trends and market conditions the market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to the impact of any one or more events including but not limited to the following i our inability to raise the financing required to fund the acquisition of our initial  equity interest in mineracao batovi ii changes in the global market for diamonds iii failure to meet market expectations on mineracao batovi’s exploration activities iv sales of a large number of our shares held by certain stockholders including institutions and insiders v legal claims brought forth against us and vi introduction of technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies   a prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain additional financing which would adversely affect our operations   historically we have relied on equity financing as the primary source of funding a prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global markets may result in our inability to secure the financing required to fund the acquisition of our initial  equity interest in mineracao batovi or to seek additional financing which would have an adverse effect on our operations   additional issuances of our common stock may result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders and reduce the market value of their investment   we are authorized to issue  shares of common stock of which  shares were issued and outstanding as of january   future issuances for financings mergers and acquisitions exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants and for other reasons may result in significant dilution to and be issued at prices substantially below the price paid for our shares held by our existing stockholders significant dilution would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power held by our existing stockholders and may result in a decrease in the market price of our shares        table of contents   item

diamond mining diamond mines can be categorized into two main groups most of the significant diamond mines around the world target the primary diamond deposits – the volcanic rocks called kimberlites and in rare cases closely related volcanic rocks called lamproites that brought the diamonds to surface the second type of mine targets the diamonds that have been eroded from these primary sources at the batovi project our main focus is discovering the primary kimberlite source of the alluvial diamonds found in the rivers the recovery of diamonds from kimberlite is based upon the physical differences of diamond and the kimberlite as diamond is relatively dense the first steps in a recovery plant are typically designed to produce a dense concentrate a dense media separator is used to remove the light material leaving in most cases less than  of the material as a heavy concentrate this concentrate contains diamond and other dense minerals including many of the diamond indicator minerals discussed in the exploration section diamond is then recovered from this concentrate using two additional properties of diamond when diamonds are exposed to xrays most will fluoresce an xray sorter recovers any minerals that fluoresce from the concentrate diamonds are also hydrophobic and lipophyllic – they repel water but are attracted to grease thus grease tables are commonly used as a final recovery step the concentrate is passed over a table coated in grease diamonds will adhere to the grease while other minerals continue to pass over the table periodically the grease table is scraped off – recovering any diamonds as described above the recovery of diamonds has a minimal impact on the environment kimberlite itself is relatively benign and the chemicals used in the recovery process are inert operations the batovi strike team why mato grosso brazil claims exploring for diamonds extracting diamonds video batovi project news releases corporate presentation  videos signup

fipke has invested over m of his own money into the project demonstrating his belief and commitment exceptionally large diamonds up to  carats in size have been found in the claims area by artisanal miners the project is accessed by a wellmaintained road network the project’s results to date point to the potential that exists to find one or more kimberlites containing large high quality diamonds
