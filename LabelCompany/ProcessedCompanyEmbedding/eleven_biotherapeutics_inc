upon the companys tpt platform the companys tpts incorporate a tumortargeting antibody fragment and a protein cytotoxic payload into a single protein molecule in order to achieve focused tumor cell killing the company believes its tpt approach offers significant advantages in treating cancer over existing adc technologies the company believes its tpts provide effective tumor targeting with broader cancer cellkilling properties than are achievable with small molecule payloads that require tumor cell proliferation and face multidrug resistance mechanisms additionally the company believes that its tpts cancer cellkilling properties promote an antitumor immune response that will potentially combine well with immunooncology drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors for more information please

product candidates formulated with vb are capable of driving host antitumor immune responses that can potentiate the activity of immunooncology agentsas part of the same poster presentation eleven shared data from a preclinical model in patientderived xenograft tumorbearing mice reconstituted with a human immune system which was used to assess the combination of intratumoral injection of vb with the antipd antibody nivolumab treatment with vb alone suppressed the growth of injected tumors while monotherapy nivolumab had little effect in contralateral noninjected tumors responses from mice treated with both vb and nivolumab were more pronounced than responses in mice treated with either product as a monotherapy based on these results eleven believes that vb killing of tumor cells could facilitate and augment checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activitysystemicallyadministered tpt pipeline eleven’s initial systemicallyadministered tpts leverage a proprietary highly potent deimmunized plant toxin debouganin debouganin has picomolar killing of cancer cells and may be effective against cancer stem cells in preclinical studies debouganin demonstrated the ability to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms that can decrease the efficacy of small molecule payloads based on these results eleven believes that debouganinbased therapies may be effective against a wide spectrum of cancers investigational new drug application ind submission for vbd planned for first quarter of  at the aacr annual meeting eleven presented preclinical data suggesting that its debouganin payload is capable of effectively killing tumor cells that are resistant to treatment with antibody drug conjugates adcs composed of dm and mmae payloads when conjugated to the same monoclonal antibody trastuzumab the company believes this is due in part to debouganin’s lack of sensitivity to both the multidrug resistance pumps and the changes in phosphorylation status of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival that allow some cancers to escape the action of antimitotic adcsread morecorporate eleven further expanded its internal clinical development team with two key hires gary

company’s tpts incorporate a tumortargeting antibody fragment and a protein cytotoxic payload into a single protein molecule in order to achieve focused tumor cell killing the company believes its tpt approach offers significant advantages in treating cancer over existing adc technologies the company believes its tpts provide effective tumor targeting with broader cancer cellkilling properties than are achievable with small molecule payloads that require tumor cell proliferation and face multidrug resistance mechanisms additionally the company believes that its tpt’s cancer cellkilling properties promote an antitumor immune response that will potentially combine well with immunooncology drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors for more information please refer to the company’s website at
