customer service    mf  dimensions     w d h seat h arm h bol asymmetric sofa left      more in the barber osgerby collection product story designer in  barber and osgerby debuted their first collaboration with knoll at salone internazionale del mobile di milano before introducing their eponymous collection to the market the following year inspired by florence knoll’s iconic sofa—which in turn borrowed the aesthetic vocabulary of ludwig mies van der rohe’s oeuvre—barber and osgerby began the design process by considering the chair as an architectural object “architecturally we wanted to refer to the famous florence knoll sofa so we created this architectural delineated envelope which is also supremely comfortable” the chairs’ tshaped legs are both a source of structure and support fitting between the joints of the cushions to serve the dual purpose of foot and connector the result is seamless design that does away with the  frame creating the appearance of a wholly integrated piece of furniture composed of several different components for this reason osgerby contends “the foot is really the icon of the sofa it fits between each one of the arms and the seats which are the architectural building blocks of the sofa internationally acclaimed designers edward barber and jay osgerby founded their studio in  after graduating with master’s degrees in architecture from the royal college of art in london alongside their eponymous studio in  barber and osgerby founded universal design studio now recognized as one of the world’s most innovative creative design
