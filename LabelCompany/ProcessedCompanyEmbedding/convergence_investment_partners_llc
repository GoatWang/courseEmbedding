overview convergence core plus opportunities fund convergence market neutral fund dividend growth satm unbiased index the theory ordinary income tax and short term capital gains rates approach  at the federal levelﾠand can be over  at the state level successful investing in the future will result in increased taxes the impact could be significant historically reducing the impact of taxes on your investment portfolio has meant looking for losses that can be realized near the end of each calendar year for most investors in fact so much more can be done a significant body of research exists as to the impact of taxes on investor’s returns and the benefit that an actively managed portfolio designed to minimize the impact of taxes can have on returns over time our research has shown that a systematic process that harvests tax losses throughout the entire year is more beneficial than the pedestrian year end scramble for losses althoughﾠactive management can help minimize tax drag some active managers still struggle to outperform marketﾠindexes on an after tax basis even indexing traditionally viewed as a taxefficient alternative has shown to suffer under the burden of taxes due to constituent changes corporate reorganizations and dividends mutual funds carry a further burden by law mutual funds are required to distribute  of their realized gains each year but are not allowed to distribute any realized capital losses by contrast we blieve that actively managed tax efficient portfolios that incorporate an active tax loss harvesting strategy are able to have a significant impact on the portfolio over time the cip strategy since  the principals at cip have managed an active tax management strategy which focuses on capturing market returns with minimal tracking error while deferring the realization of capital gains and harvesting net tax losses to the extent possible the strategy is built on the simple notion that tax losses have economic value two portfolios of equal value which realize the same rate of return will have the same pretax value at the end of the year if the first portfolio has realized taxable gains while the other portfolio has been able to avoid realizing gains the payment of taxes will cause the values to diverge in addition if net losses for tax purposes are realized those losses can be used to offset capital gains realized in other portfolios the investor may have the value of the tax losses is the ability to immediately offset gains realized elsewhere resulting in immediate savings in taxes this savings increases the investor’s net worth by increasing the aftertax return of their entire asset allocation cip utilizes a sophisticated optimization program to invest the portfolios within our active tax management program each portfolio is managed individually by targeting the portfolio against a designated benchmark index and regularly reoptimized to defer capital gains seek out tax losses and minimize tracking error to the benchmark cip manages portfolios that target domestic indexes such as the russell  or sp  with over  years of experience maximizing aftertax value we have found the active tax management strategy an essential tool to any taxable investor seeking to maximize the growth in their net worth convergence makes no guarantee regarding tax consequences of a tax loss harvesting strategy fact sheet you

contact targeted solutions overview convergence core plus opportunities fund convergence market neutral fund dividend growth satm unbiased index the theory academic and street research has looked into dividend policy and the performance of stocks for many years from a purely theoretical standpoint the argument was that fast growing companies in constant need of cash and unable to pay dividends represented more attractive long term investments slower growing more mature companies paid out dividends because they lacked attractive investment alternatives and therefore represented less attractive investments the problem is that history does not bear this out shown below is the cumulative performance since  of stocks ranked by dividend yield the chart breaks down the russell  universe of stocks into  buckets decile  represents the top  of stocks ranked by dividend yield decile  represents the stocks whose dividend yield is between the top  and the top  and so on note that over the last  years all top  deciles outperformed the lower paying stocks even decile  whose dividend yields are extremely high typically because their stock price has fallen and the dividend is in trouble outperformed their low or no paying dividend counterparts the undeniable fact that higher dividend paying stocks have outperformed has led to a body of research into the “signaling effect” in short much of the research has concluded that management adjusts their dividend policy based on the confidence that they have in the long term outlook for their company and the company’s ability to grow their earnings the more confident management is in their ability to grow earnings into the future the more comfortable they are in raising the dividend in fact studies have shown that management will typically raise their dividend if they feel that the increase in their earnings is “permanent in nature” versus another shareholder friendly policy of buying back shares of stock if they think that the increase in earnings is more cycle in nature the cip strategy the cip dividend growth strategy starts by narrowing the universe of eligible securities for consideration to those companies in the top half of stocks ranked by dividend yield top  deciles as illustrated in the chart above we then apply our proprietary multifactor model to identify those companies that display attractive growth rates but sell at a reasonable price the portfolio is diversified using a risk model in an effort to obtain the highest return while assuming the lowest risk the final result is a well diversified portfolio of above average dividend paying stocks the dividend yield has historically rivaled fixed income alternatives in terms of absolute yield but has the added advantage of growth in dividends historically that such a strategy is very competitive with the broader market on a total rate of return basis over time fact sheet you are now leaving the convergence investment partners
