evolution than the darwinian modelmarketing and the product life cycleover the last three decades one of the most frequently discussed concepts inmanagement and in marketing theory has been the product life cycleconcept the origins of product life cycle plc theory lie in the biologicallife cycle in which individual organisms are observed to pass through aseries of identifiable stages from birth into a period of growth maturitydeclinesenility and eventually deathplc theory draws an analogy between this biological progression and thepath followed by a product over its life in the plc products areintroduced to the market ie there is an event analogous to birth followingits introduction a products sales are expected to enter a period of growth asseen in a biological organism as it establishes itself in its environment nextcomes a period of maturity in which product sales are quite stablecorresponding with the relatively long period of adult life in which fewmajor physical changes occur to the organism at some indeterminate timehowever a product is thought to end its maturity stage and the productssales fall the product is then said to be in a period of decline much as anorganism becomes progressively less active in its later years and showssigns of senility finally a products life effectively ends as sales drop tozero or near to zero analogous to the death of the organism in simple termsthen the plc can be described as the sales pattern exhibited by a productover time from introduction to its eventual demise cox  in otherwords the plc proposes that a products sales are a function of time elapsedsubsequent to its introduction to the market see figure a significant body of marketing literature in particular literature whichexamines product management issues introduces the reader to the plc andpresents it as an appropriate and legitimate framework of analysis eg catryand chevalier  wasson  this is probably not surprisingthe current issue and full text
