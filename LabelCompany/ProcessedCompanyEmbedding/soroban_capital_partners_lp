what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions

provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha managed funds which do are a good way

partners has taken up a  activist position in california resources corp nysecrc according to a filing on monday with the sec soroban disclosed ownership of  million shares  of all common shares soroban is the first hedge fund to disclose such a position in the recently spunoff company soroban which is named after a japanese abacus was started in  by mandelblatt who had previously been a partner and coceo at tpgaxon capital management lp the fund has a focus on equity trading and has quickly built an equity portfolio valued at over  billion as of september   given mandelblatt’s background as a former energy analyst for goldman sachs it’s unsurprising soroban has invested in a number of different companies in the sector including cheniere energy inc nysemktlng one of their top holdings throughout  midstream energy was an industry mandelblatt highlighted as being one with particularly interesting opportunties prior to launching his fund it becomes even less surprising when one considers soroban’s interest in california resources corp nysecrc’s former parent company occidental petroleum corporation nyseoxy soroban has held call options on occidental since the second half of  and those options represented the second most valuable position in their equity portfolio as of september  when they increased them by  to  million soroban clearly feels very strongly about occidental’s spunoff california division which was formerly a subsidiary of occidental at the time of the spinoff announcement back in february  the california subsidiary accounted for onefifth of occidental’s total oil and natural gas production in the third quarter of  they produced the equivalent of  barrels of oil per day and hold  million net acres of drilling rights in california the spinoff of the subsidiary was completed on november  and california resources corp nysecrc began trading publicly on the nyse on december  at  which was well below estimates of where the stock would open issued shares to occidental shareholders began trading offmarket in the middle of november at  which was  below the  range expected however slumping crude oil prices conspired to greatly limit the value of the new company from earlier estimates and it would continue to drop over the following two months to as low as  in late january since then the stock has rebounded by more than  and has vaulted another  in early morning trading today as crude oil appears to be rebounding slightly from its recordlow levels down more than  since june those low oil prices prompted california resources corp nysecrc to give up on a previously planned drilling project in carson california which they first proposed in  the plan would’ve called for  wells to be built in the dominguez oil fields south of

named after a japanese abacus soroban capital parters outperforms by sticking to their fundamental investment philosophy a japanese abacus let’s open this week with a little game name the first three activist managers that come to mind odds are those names are the ones that grab the headlines in the wall street journal or cable news i’m sure many of you remember seeing icahn and ackman throwing figurative punches on cnbc not too long ago that said blustery rhetoric on tv doesn’t always equal alpha for your investors i’d be willing to guess one name is not on your list eric mandelblatt who after leaving tpg axon in  with a small team founded soroban capital partners much more quietly than their bloviating counterparts soroban has been achieving outsized returns for just as long and will be the focus of this article mandelblatt’s undertheradar nature shouldn’t come as a surprise to those who know the source of their fund’s name an abacus developed in japan in the th century sorobans are still widely used today despite many available electronic calculation alternatives this namebased allusion to tradition straighttothepoint effectiveness and an air of simplicity could go a long way to explaining the firm’s very successful approach to business a quick note before we continue as with all our manager mondays keep in mind that everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance regardless this data can be incredibly insightful if viewed with the right prism soroban’s performance and growth since january of  the fund’s first required reporting period one can see soroban’s simulated portfolio strongly outperforming both the general dj credit suisse hedge fund index bm and the hfrx activist index bm the fund’s longs returned  against  for the hf index and  for the activists for greater context the sp  was up  over the time period highlighting some of the recent struggles within the hedge fund industry as a whole soroban was neither scathed by the afflictions of its brethren nor constrained by the market as a whole convincingly cruising along on a wave of outperformance as one might expect with great investment success comes great assets visualized through the proxy of market value soroban’s market value rose drastically over the interval from a shade under  billion to over  billion presently as this happens many funds can become victims of their own success in these situations we at novus usually look for three main levers a fund can pull as it grows how did soroban cope with their growth did they increase the number of positions with some variance the fund increased positions from  to  but this change is not necessarily commensurate with their overall increase in market value fall into a liquidity trap again save the one outlying data point this is not so on the whole soroban has remained very liquid over the interval move up the market cap spectrum here we do find evidence of a trend with soroban moving from the upper mid cap range of  billion at the end of  to a strongly large cap number of over  billion at present we’ll look at this in more detail in our next section i can hear you saying “this is all well and good but what can i actually derive from this” from this data i draw one main conclusion soroban was ready to grow and were one step ahead of the curve they were ready to be scalable from the outset seamlessly adjusting to their new realities the scaledup soroban portfolio if we crosssection this scalability as of the  december filing period one can see soroban’s top  long positions by issuer these are major global firms large brand names considering the upward market cap shift this is understandable and potentially expected expanding this to the whole portfolio and slicing by market cap one will notice – also unsurprisingly – that the current main capital allocation is in the mega cap space  with an additional substantial allocation to large cap  using novus’ recently released multigrouping functionality within those main market cap buckets you can see on a sector level  of the  mega cap positions are focused in staples discretionary it and telecom while the smaller allocation to large cap names actually has greater sector diversity with the notable entry of the energy sector as well as getting a glimpse into soroban’s postscale sector positioning we can evidence where the fund has seen sector value over time looking from their first filing until today you can see consistent long allocations into the discretionary sector while the current portfolio has pivoted substantial assets into it and staples at the expense of the recently troubled energy sector this evident pragmatism with respect to the energy sector alludes to the core soroban approach we touched on in the introduction now that we have this understanding into the nimble way in which the firm has grown as well as their current long portfolio structure let’s move back into the world of the quite good performance metrics and derive some more insights there how soroban outperforms the highlevel attribution statistics for soroban’s long portfolio over time are pretty outstanding the firm has won on  of their investments while allocating  of their capital to those investments these two metrics help to explain an excellent x winloss ratio in which soroban has on average made bps relative to bps on a loser showing the fund’s ability to nip losing investments in the bud while sticking with their winners relative to the sp  and their associated sector benchmarks soroban generated bps –  of their total contribution – via security selection alpha this alpha was achieved across the sector spectrum with only the most minor of detractors these broad wins evidence core persistent fundamental firm strength over time rather than a return stream with fluky outliers and inconsistent or volatile contributors this is exactly what you want to see as a prospective or existing investor and doesn’t surprise me considering the firm culture i’ve derived this winloss analysis and broad alpha contribution led me to consider how the fund sized their positions over time and what i found here was a tad surprising though the firm did outperform a portfolio in which each of their positions was equally weighted over time more often than not with numbers as strong as we’ve seen one might expect to see greater alpha here taking it a step deeper and visualizing winloss ratio by position sizing bucket one metric stands out that of the  –  bracket if soroban is able to nudge this up toward the firm average they could see even greater outsized returns in the future with other conditions remaining the same however this is admittedly nitpicky since soroban is still generating excess returns  versus  on a cumulative basis via position sizing summarily it seems as even when they are wrong they are right final considerations what we’ve seen here is a relatively young fund punching with the heavyweights they’ve scaledup effectively and continued to outpace the hedge fund industry their activist counterparts and the market additionally they’ve done this in a time period that hasn’t been overly kind to the hedge fund industry as a whole soroban as a fund may not stay under the radar much longer but don’t be surprised if mr mandelblatt continues to avoid the limelight focusing on continuing to produce clean efficient and effective calculations on his abacus if what is above is any indicator this should be welcome news to his investors investor transparency complementing risk reports with public positions although managers have increased the transparency that they provide to investors moving from just returns to
