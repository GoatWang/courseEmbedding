 gaap net sales were  million an increase of  sequentially and  yearoveryear q gaap net sales included  million expense for the comcast warrant q gaap gross margin decreased  basis points sequentially to  as the benefit of a more favorable product mix was offset by the impact of the higher sequential comcast warrant expense q gaap operating expense decreased approximately  sequentially due mainly to the timing of expenses q gaap tax rate was  compared to  in q for fiscal  we expect our gaap tax rate to be in the  to  range moving on to the nongaap results which exclude the impact of sharebased compensation amortization of acquired intangibles acquisition or dispositionrelated and other nonrecurring charges not tied to current operations q of fiscal  net sales were  million a  sequential increase on  increase yearoveryear and represented a sixth consecutive quarter of results above the midpoint of our guidance in q shipments into asia represented  of total net sales north america was  and europe was  the total sales to distribution represented approximately  and the net sales represented approximately  q bookings again increased sequentially and yearoveryear and resulted in a booktobill firmly above  those bookings accounted for approximately  of shipments during the quarter q fiscal  nongaap gross margin was  an increase of  basis points sequentially due to more favorable mix of products we expect our q fiscal  nongaap gross margin to be flattish to slightly higher sequentially as a reminder during our last call we increased our nongaap gross margin target range to  to  versus our prior range of  to  we expect much of our growth to come from higher margin businesses and increased absorption from overall revenue growth and royalty and licensing revenue from lora should enable us to sustain this higher gross margin range we also increased our nongaap operating margin model to  to  accordingly and we expect we could begin to achieve the midpoint of this new range of  at a quarterly revenue run rate of  million q of fiscal  nongaap operating expense was  million down  from q levels due to the timing of expenses in q we expect our nongaap operating expense to increase approximately  sequentially mainly from higher variable compensation expense driven by stronger demand for modeling purposes we continue to expect our nongaap operating expenses for fiscal  to be similar to fiscal  and to average approximately  million a quarter in q of fiscal  our nongaap tax rate was  we expect our fiscal  nongaap tax rate to be between  and  based on current assumptions regarding the regional mix of revenue in q cash flow from operations was approximately  million as q is typically a seasonally weaker quarter as we make our annual bonus payments cash and investments in q were  million and our debt balance at the end of q was approximately  million leaving us in a positive net cash position in q approximately  of our cash and investments were domiciled in international accounts and  was based in the us we repurchased approximately  million or  shares of stock and the outstanding stock repurchase authorization stands at approximately  million the primary use of cash continues to be to pay down our debt make strategic investments and opportunistically repurchase our shares in q of fiscal  accounts receivable increased  sequentially due to higher net sales and the lower mix of shipments to distributors our days of sales outstanding decreased  days to  days as we managed below the target range of  to  days due to better shipment linearity and the higher mix of shipments to distributors net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased approximately  sequentially and represented  days of inventory and above the target range of  to  days in q we expect our inventory to increase slightly in response to increasing demand in summary fiscal year  is off to a great start for semtech we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of strong performance as our growth drivers and target markets are continuing to deliver solid results our gross margins are expanding and we are controlling our opex which is delivering strong operating leverage all of this leads us to believe the company is poised to deliver a record financial performance in fiscal year  i will now hand the call over to mohan mohan maheswaran thank you emeka good afternoon everyone i will discuss our q fiscal year  performance by end market and by product group and then provide our outlook for q of fiscal year  in q of fiscal year  we achieved nongaap net revenues of  million an increase of  sequentially and  over the same period a year ago we posted nongaap gross margin of  and nongaap earnings per diluted share of  in q of fiscal year  demand from the enterprise computing market increased over the prior quarter and represented  of total net revenues demand from the highend consumer market also increased from the prior quarter and represented  of total net revenues approximately  of highend consumer net revenues was attributable to handheld devices and approximately  was attributable to other consumer systems demand from the industrial and communications markets declined over the prior quarter and represented  and  of total net revenues respectively i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups beginning with our signal integrity product group in q of fiscal year  net revenues from our signal integrity product group increased  sequentially and represented  of total net revenues demand from the enterprise computing market increased sequentially our gigabit per second clearedge platforms achieved a new quarterly revenue record driven by demand from the cloud and hyperscale data center markets our gigabit per second pon platforms also achieved a new quarterly revenue record driven by fiber to the home and enterprise deployments mostly in china we expect the demand from these segments to continue to increase throughout this fiscal year our signal integrity product group is a leading provider of clock data recovery circuits or cdrs and physical media devices or pmds used in a wide range of optical modules spanning from gigabit per second to gigabit per second we are benefiting from several trends led by an underlying demand for higher bandwidth these trends are driving increased demand for our clearedge platforms that address the signal integrity issues associated with higher data rates the higher demand for our cdrs along with strong demand for our pmd platforms is contributing to increased semtech content in optical modules across all of our markets during the quarter we announced several new highperformance lowpower and lowcost clearedge platforms targeted at nextgeneration gig and gig optical modules used in data center applications we also introduced our first gigabaud pam linear driver and tia chipset that provides a seamless interface to pam optics tailored for gig and gig modules we continue to make good progress on our single lambda gigabit per second pam platform through our partnership with multiphy and we believe we are well positioned in the emerging gigabit per second singlelambda pam market which is expected to gain traction towards the end of next year our signal integrity product group continues to bring to market platforms tailored to provide the highest performance and lowest power to the fastestgrowing segments of the enterprise computing and communications markets with the steady pace of new products and a doubling of our sam from our target markets expected over the next few years we believe our signal integrity product group will continue to deliver doubledigit yearonyear revenue growth which it has produced over the last  years in q of fiscal year  we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to increase led by demand from the data center and gigabit pon markets moving on to our protection product group in q of fiscal year  net revenues from our protection product group increased  sequentially and  over q of the prior year and represented  of total net revenues demand increased sequentially from the highend consumer and the industrial end markets demand from our korean smartphone customers increased significantly over the prior quarter driven by the ramp of new flagship smartphone models and the broader use of highend protection platforms across multiple smartphone models this strength offset some weakness in the china smartphone market in q our protection product group continues to benefit from several secular industry trends contributing to its growth the use of more advanced chip lithography utilized in today’s electronic systems has resulted in lower levels of onchip protection leading to the use of more offchip highperformance protection additionally mobile system manufacturers are demanding higher performance in smaller form factors where semtech’s innovative zplatforms deliver the most compelling solutions finally in communications industrial and automotive systems where lower performance discrete protection devices were once good enough we are seeing a transition to semtech’s advanced protection platforms with our low capacitance robust transient voltage protection and high surge protection are now replacing these lowerperformance solutions our protection product group is also focused on developing new products to help expand into new fastgrowing and emerging markets including iot automotive and data centers during the quarter we announced additions to our rclamp protection platform that can be used for protecting iot gateways and end nodes from electrostatic discharge events at the automotive ethernet congress recently held in munich we showcased our latest protection solutions targeting automotive systems that require reliable robust performance with minimum maintenance semtech’s industryleading protection devices are able to safeguard these nextgeneration automotive ethernet ports from esd threats our protection product group’s strategy of focusing on advanced lithography protection while diversifying the business is paying off and we believe in this should contribute to sustainable growth over the next several years in q of fiscal year  we expect our protection business to increase from the prior quarter on higher demand expected from our smartphone customers turning to our wireless and sensing product group in q of fiscal year  net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased  sequentially and increased  over q of fiscal year  and represented  of total net revenues q results represented a new quarterly revenue record for our wireless and sensing product group led by record revenues from both our lora and proximity sensing platforms our lora business achieved another revenue record and continues to exceed our expectations as the global lora ecosystem is transitioning from running proofofconcepts and trials to deploying real iot use cases it has become clear that lowpower longrange wide area networks are the enabler for a new generation of iot use cases that can be deployed quickly and inexpensively and has the potential to disrupt many existing industries we believe that by the end of fiscal year  there will be an estimated  outdoor lorawan gateways installed globally we believe that this network footprint will be able to support more than  billion lorabased end nodes or sensors we anticipate a number of indoor picocell and outdoor macrocell lorawan gateways to continue to increase dramatically over the next few years and enable connectivity of billions of lorawan sensors within a few years we are now seeing a steep increase in the availability of lorawan sensors and end nodes being developed and announced this is beginning to enable many new lora use cases some of the recent sensor announcements from our ecosystem partners include butano  a spanish company developing iot devices for energy and utility companies created a gas bottle sensor to measure the gas level within the bottle when the gas level gets low a request for refill can be automatically triggered using lora maxtrack a leader in vehicle tracker solutions developed a solution that helps recover stolen vehicles and cargo in metropolitan areas of brazil where lorawan networks are now being deployed eddy home an awardwinning manufacturer of residential water technologies developed a lorabased smart home water protection solution designed to provide users  protection from slow leaks burst pipes and other unforeseen circumstances global sat demonstrated a large number of lora end node devices at embedded world designed for applications like smart buildings smart agriculture air quality water leaks and vibration detection these are a few of the many lorawan sensors and end nodes currently under development in addition to the increasing deployment of gateways globally and the increasing availability of lora sensors we are also seeing the emergence of new exciting lorawan used cases some of these used cases use advanced features such as gps free geolocation while others use the simplicity and low cost of lora to disrupt existing verticals the lora alliance and its global member footprint continues to grow with providers in over  countries having announced lora network trials or deployments a notable addition to the lora alliance in q was comcast whose trials in usa continue to progress very nicely comcast has been elected to the lora alliance board and will also host the next lora alliance all members meeting in philadelphia in june we anticipate that comcast will begin to communicate the progress of its machineq lorawan initiative at this meeting in q our proximity sensing business also delivered a new quarterly revenue record as mobile device manufacturers attempt to sense and control rf emissions we are seeing increasing demand for our proximity sensing platforms from smartphones and wearables as regulations against excessive radio emissions close to the human body become more stringent as the usage of highpowered radios in mobile devices increases we believe that the use of semtech’s proximity sensing platforms will also increase for q of fiscal year  we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase driven by increased demand for our lora and proximity sensing platforms turning to our power and highrel product group in q of fiscal year  our power and highreliability product group decreased  sequentially and represented  of total net revenues demand decreased across all our end markets from the prior quarter driven mostly by seasonal trends our power and highrel business remains focused on delivering differentiated platforms for the automotive industrial and wearable segments semtech’s wireless charging platforms deliver flexibility and versatility across numerous product segments by offering a programmable multimode and scalable solution with power ranging from  milliwatts to over  watts our linkcharge family of wireless power products provides a range of solutions enabling wireless power for products used by consumers infrastructure and industrial applications design win activity for wireless charging remains solid and we expect industry adoption to increase significantly over the next  to  months interest also remains strong for our newest neoiso switching platforms from customers developing selfpowered control systems used in iot applications such as smart thermostats alarm panels and factory automation systems other customers are also using our neoiso products to replace designs that were using older mechanical relays and we expect this business to continue to grow as more systems continue this transition in q our power and highrel product group released a record number of new products targeting a broad range of applications these products included our newest family – product family of load switches as well as our linkcharge lowpower platform used for charging multiple devices we expect to continue to release more new power platforms in the next few quarters that is expected to drive revenue growth for this business over the next several years in q of fiscal year  we expect net revenues from our power and highreliability product group to rebound nicely from the seasonally lower q in q the total company distribution pos was flat with the prior quarter’s record performance distributor inventory increased by  day from  days in q to  days in q and remains at the lower end of our targeted range of  to  days our distributor business remains very well balanced with  of the total pos coming from the highend consumer and enterprise computing end markets and  of total pos coming from the industrial and communications end markets moving on to new products and design wins in q of fiscal year  we released  new products and we achieved  new design wins in addition our design win dollars achieved a new quarterly record now let me discuss our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year  based on current bookings trends we are currently estimating q nongaap net revenues to be between  million and  million to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately  million we needed net turns orders of approximately  at the beginning of q we expect our q gaap earnings to be between  and  per diluted share and our q nongaap earnings to be between  and  per diluted share i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of cody acree with drexel hamilton cody acree hi guys thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the continued progress mohan maybe if you could talk a bit more about the chinese oem weakness what kind of visibility do you have to that recovery and was it seasonality or inventory excesses i guess what do you contribute that to mohan maheswaran well the only chinese weakness we see is in the base station side mostly i think it just hasn’t come back it’s not growing as fast as we’d like it to grow but i don’t think it’s weak so much as it’s just we haven’t seen any indications that it’s going to grow anytime soon but that i think is the only area in the infrastructure side that we see the weakness the pon side specifically the gig pon seems to be doing quite well i would say the low bandwidth pon is kind of slow but that would be i think all we see and then on the smartphone side the china smartphone customers were definitely weaker in q we anticipate probably that will start strengthen at the end of q and then second half probably they will be a little bit stronger but that’s on the smartphone side cody acree and thank you for that emeka with that broad range of gross margin guidance that you have given but obviously a lot of things trending towards the upper end of that i guess what kind of scenario would you envision that could put you back into that lower end given what you are seeing in your demand mix trends emeka chukwu well i think cody our gross margin story just continues to remain very simple it’s mostly driven by the mix of revenues our enterprise computing our industrial and communications revenues do come with much higher gross margins than the highend consumer so if at anytime we see a much bigger mix of highend consumer revenue that could move us more to the lower end but having said that what we’re anticipating is that the current mix of businesses that we have now and the end markets that we have right now allows us to stay at the current level  to  gross margin if you will then what we expect in the next year to  months is that we’ll start to see more revenue contribution from the industrial and the automobile sections for our protection group of products and that we’ll start to see more revenue contributions for our power management from the industrial and our communications end markets as well so that actually would allow us to continue to move our gross margins forward we think those are the drivers that would take us about  to  and like i said during the call during my prepared remarks when we start seeing a significant contribution from lora ip and the geolocation revenue that is actually what takes us to the  to  gross margin range cody acree perfect thank you for that and then lastly if you just have any comments about the expectations for seasonality for the second half of the year mohan maheswaran well that’s tough to call cody at the moment we are anticipating a strong year certainly our guidance for q suggests a strong q and currently our thoughts are that the second half is going to be reasonably strong as well and as we talked about our record year it kind of indicates that q is probably going to be fairly strong and then q is too far out to call i think but seasonally that’s typically down but it’s a question of how far down right cody acree alright thank you guys congrats mohan maheswaran thank you operator your next question comes from the line of harsh kumar from stephens inc harsh kumar congratulations mohan emeka sandy very good job on execution i had a couple of questions emeka if i can ask you every now and then i see these payments to comcast i was curious are they annual or are they goalbased could you maybe clarify when we can expect them and also how many cities are the gateways by comcast rolled out in the us emeka chukwu so harsh yes this is the expenses that are tied to the warrants that we give to comcast as they are getting with trying to rollout lora platforms across the us the expense is recognized on a quarterly basis and is actually really driven by the amount of work that they have actually done there are various milestones that are included in the agreement and based on how much of the milestones they have actually achieved then that’s how we recognize expenses so every quarter there are two things that would drive the amount of the expense it is the amount of work done and also any change in stock price so it’s an expense that is recorded every quarter we anticipate that we are going to be doing this all of fiscal  and  our expectation for fiscal  based on the agreement and the milestones is that we are probably going to pickup a total of about  million of expense that is related to this comcast warrant i think so far based on the q results and what we have guided to in q we have already recorded  million the expectation is that the remaining amounts which is about  million is going to be mostly back endloaded based on where we expect the milestones to be achieved harsh kumar understood thank you emeka and how many cities has this rolled out in yet mohan maheswaran so harsh the trials are currently going on in philadelphia san francisco chicago and then assuming those trials go well then they will roll out into additional  cities and then follow on from then  more and then end up with  cities was the commitment that they made to us harsh kumar understood mohan if i can ask you one more the data center piece how large is that bucket i know you don’t break it out quite like that but i was curious is it greater than  midteens or whatever you can throw at me in terms of color and then also what is the growth rate that you are seeing in that bucket if you had a – if i had to make you guess that number mohan maheswaran well it’s about midteens harsh you are right we don’t break it out and we do have various contributors several of our businesses contributing into that business area but the fastest growing is by far our clearedge cdr platforms which are really doing very well the quad cdrs in the data center applications and that is growing last year it was  over  growth i think and this year it’s going to grow double – very highend double digits i think probably in the   kind of growth harsh kumar okay understood and i was surprised to see the wireless charging maybe was down – i know it’s not a big part of your business but i was surprised to see it was down in the april quarter any specific reason for that mohan or was it just the way things shook out mohan maheswaran yes the whole power and highrel business so it wasn’t just the wireless charging piece of it i think was more seasonal harsh i think some of our power business is more kind of core legacy kind of power business so tied to the pc market and some of that stuff the areas that are growing other wireless charging the neoiso areas and so i think it’s nothing to be concerned about my sense is that it’s going to come back again in q harsh kumar got it and last one mohan when i look at your company i see several areas that are just in hyper growth such as lora and then maybe even the data center piece and several others that are coming back how should i think of the correct growth rate of your company i know that you – historically you said it’s gdp plus something and then i think the latest take was maybe closer to high single digits but when i look at these kind of growth sectors’ stable economy what i should be thinking of as a correct growth rate more appropriate growth rate for the company mohan maheswaran well we have always said harsh the plan has always been we take industry plus or minus – plus  growth and that’s kind of what we will target obviously with things going the way they are we should achieve a record year this year and grow and outperform the industry again which is good certainly we rely on the data center hyperscale and the cloud growth the mobile market to continue to do well and then of course the iot space the  key areas of end market growth for us and that’s what we focus on and as long as those markets do well then we should have a very strong year harsh kumar congrats guys mohan maheswaran thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mitch steves from rbc capital mitch steves hi guys thanks for taking my question so i wanted to kind of turn to signal integrity and just talk like kind of the optical side of the business can you maybe give us an update i know you guys said that optical is about  of that segment so what kind of trends are you guys seeing and how do you think it shakes out for the rest of the year mohan maheswaran yes the optical business is doing very well our optical business is mostly on the data center side but we also have obviously the gig gpon which i mentioned is doing very well as well the base station not so well as i mentioned so i think we expect the data center side to continue to do quite well for the rest of the year and our expectation is gig pon as well is going to continue to do quite well for the rest of the year so we are expecting and anticipate the optical business to continue to have a very strong year mitch steves got it and then secondly just kind of circling back into warrants and lora so is that  million number essentially all lora and then are you guys still on track or expected to beat that  million target you had out in ‘ or so mohan maheswaran well i will take that question first and then emeka can talk about the comcast warrants we had set up a path to achieve  million of revenues from lora last couple of years we have done very well we grew our lora business quite nicely and last year we were in the  million to  million range this year we are expecting to be in the  million to –  million to  million range i think and next year hopefully in the  million to  million range which is kind of the goal the momentum is going very nicely obviously i mentioned lots more gateways out there lots more connectivity to those gateways and then lots more use cases so it’s going i think really better than we had anticipated the growth vector at the moment it’s also very global we have over  to  countries now rolling out lora networks and the comcast initiative was a very important initiative which we obviously announced last year but it’s starting to do quite well for us from the standpoint of the north america market where we do need the connectivity and so comcast is a key partner for us there and so that’s why that’s important but emeka do you want emeka chukwu yes so steve the  million is entirely due to the comcast warrant which is all for the deployment of lora in north america mitch steves perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of craig ellis from b riley  co craig ellis i thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution mohan i wanted to follow up on a couple of prepared comments and just really focus on some of the longerterm items so one with respect to signal integrity you mentioned that you have the opportunity to double your sam over the next few years can you just lay out some of the milestones to sam expansion of that magnitude mohan maheswaran yes it’s really driven by the use of cdrs in highspeed connectivity when you look at the gig systems there’s just a lower percentage of cdrs being used and as you go to gig the number of cdrs being used because of the signal integrity issues just increases dramatically so signal integrity just generally becomes a much bigger problem in higher bandwidths and that’s really the primary reason why the sam grows in addition to the fact that the markets are growing quite nicely and then we are also bringing out new products that are – we haven’t really had in some of these spaces before so as i mentioned our first real play in gig gig pmd products with our tias and drivers these are the first pam products that we have done on the pmd side so that’s also going to expand our sam so the combination of those  factors is really what’s driving the sam expansion craig ellis that’s helpful and then secondly with respect to the protection business it sounds like the large korean customer maybe taking protection to parts of the portfolio that they hadn’t at least last year – i don’t know if we can go back further than that but are you seeing that there’s broader adoption with that customer and if so what does that mean for what you would expect to see with other customers given their leading edge process technology mohan maheswaran yes and so that’s exactly right craig that’s what’s happening and i think quality has become a very key factor in the smartphone space quality and robustness and making sure that phones are not returned and so obviously protection plays a key role in that and then you go to advanced lithographies and they become more sensitive and so we feel really good about where we are not only with our korean customers but also our china customers and other smartphone customers around the world are all starting to recognize i think the value of having robust protection in their systems craig ellis lastly one perhaps for emeka with regards to the turns required to meet guidance i think it was low s   something like that that strikes me as a bit lower than normal with more normalized being in the low s am i correct on that or am i reading that incorrectly emeka chukwu yes i think you are correct in q the turns achieved was  and what we need to meet the midpoint of our guidance is  or so as you indicated right but i think that is more due to the fact that we came into the quarter with a very strong backlog so we don’t need as much turns mohan maheswaran yes  is the number that – of turns we need for this quarter to meet the midpoint of the guidance craig craig ellis great thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of tristan gerra from baird  company tristan gerra hi good afternoon given the decline in your industrial business in the quarter which was a little bit in contrast with some key areas is it fair to assume that the decline was driven by the power and highreliability product given that industrial was up in the production group and maybe a little bit more color as to how do you expect that end market to trend in the next quarter and for the rest of the year for you mohan maheswaran yes so industrial is doing well for us in general and i think will continue to do quite well mostly because of iot lora business is growing and then some other areas i would just – i would say that in q it was just overall kind of a number of different things our video business was slightly down i think general industrial and power and highrel as you already point out but we are expecting the rest of the year to be pretty robust on the industrial side tristan gerra great and then obviously very good traction in your lora business and certainly the positive commentary is echoed by what we are hearing in the channel how do you look at the initial g ecosystem rising in a few years in terms of the lora dynamics does that change anything in customer strategies using an existing network or it doesn’t matter because the power consumption is much higher so if you could just provide some more longterm color on those evolving standards mohan maheswaran yes so we believe that they will coexist the lowpower wide area network and any lte or nbiot or g kind of cellular infrastructure will coexist and the reason is very simple we think they are the two very different spaces one requires very lowpower very low cost kind of infrastructure and connectivity and the other one needs more high bandwidth and then so lora has a place today and what we are finding is many iot used cases are totally new used cases they are just new applications that you cannot use existing kind of approaches because they don’t make economic sense or they just don’t have the power the low power required so we are quite confident and that’s one of the reasons why if we look internationally and look at the different regions of the world that are using lora and have started to adopt it it’s got some very powerful kind of momentum and these are with – also with companies that will also rollout communications and telecommunication infrastructure so i think the market is there going to be big enough to accommodate multiple different approaches tristan gerra great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of rick schafer from oppenheimer josh buchalter hi this is josh buchalter on behalf of rick congrats on the results and thank you for taking my question i just wanted to dig on the china handset commentary a little more we have seen some other guys in the space mention a sharp snapback in the second quarter and would you describe it as more of an inventory issue or is it end demand not picking up until the end of your second quarter mohan maheswaran i would say it’s more that china has had a very strong ramp up in smartphones and is now stabilizing so their share in the market the global markets is kind of stabilizing so they are just trying to figure out what is their real demand and so i think it’s more of just of a q phenomenon and probably we will start in the second half to see china picking backup again josh buchalter okay thank you and then i wanted to dig a little on the protection business i can understand conceptually how moving to advanced lithographies requires more protection but are there any metrics or either attach rates or asps you can give us as we move further down process nodes like similar to cdr mohan maheswaran well it’s difficult because every advanced chip is different and every system is different but the point to make is that when you have advanced lithographies and the transistor sizes really don’t allow – the chip doesn’t really enable you to put onchip protection you need to have it offchip so almost every line that’s coming – every signal line that’s coming into the advanced chips will have to be protected outside in some shape or form and that problem only gets worse as you go to nanometer and nanometer and beyond and if you don’t protect them then there is a good chance that your system will fail josh buchalter thank you it’s very helpful congrats again mohan maheswaran thank you operator no further audio questions at this time sandy harrison okay any other questions in the queue operator operator there are no further audio questions at this time sandy harrison great thank you mohan maheswaran in closing we are pleased that fiscal year  is off to a strong start we continue to deliver performance at the upper end of our guidance range driven by our strong positions in highgrowth markets including cloud and hyperscale data centers optical connectivity mobile devices and iot our increasing margins and continued spending discipline has enabled us to consistently deliver earnings growth well in excess of our revenue growth we believe that the trends we enjoyed in q are sustainable and should help us to deliver record financial results this year with that we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next
