as american airlines’ chairman and chief executive officer in april  after less than five years in the job but he wasnt done with the airline industryhe became involved with several small airlines among them as an early investor in virgin america the californiabased carrier which began flying in  aims to combine the benefits of low costs with the virtues of betterthanaverage customer serviceon monday virgin america moves its operations from dallasfort worth international airport to dallas love field we talked to carty virgin americas chairman about the reasons for starting the airline its experiences and why it was smart to switch north texas airportsdmn what does virgin america bring to the market place in terms of customer servicedon carty that really was the original premise of this particular airline at a time for a variety of reasons all our big airlines were struggling with costs and profitability and they all went bankrupt in the end i don’t think there was as much attention paid to service as had been over the years in fact it was sort of a rush to the bottom ‘we got to get our costs down we got to get our prices down’ service of course was what sufferedwhen we originally conceived of virgin america it was with the express intent of trying to take advantage of that not the way that other startups had taken advantage of it which was simply low cost low price low service but using a more effective cost structure to deliver not just a wellpriced product a real value product but one that had a unique level of servicein fairness we got a hint of this when jetblue started their company to some degree that was their model as well they had some product features particularly tvs in the seatback a very engaged energized work force that delivered a level of service that i thought was pretty interesting at the timein fact at that time i was still at american one of the pieces of data i saw when looking at jetblue’s performance was that in spite of their pricing their average yield on some routes where they were going head to head with delta at the time was higher in other words delta had some higher prices but they were having to trash the pricing at the bottom end of the market just to fill the airplanedmn that would indicates that jetblue had customers who weren’t buying simply on pricecarty exactly jetblue was always competitive in the market place but they immediately had a following that the brand was worth something it wasn’t like some other lowcost carriers where the only aspect of the brand is you could get a cheap seat this brand clearly had some attributes that people liked when we were thinking about virgin america we obviously were informed by that experiencebut we also thought more could be done that even more creative service offering could be put in place not necessarily ones that drove inordinate levels of costs because historically a lot of service delivery was around throwing labor at it and labor is an expensive input for any business so we thought about technology and planes and design those kinds of things as well as making sure as we hired people that we had people who were really customercentricthe whole premise of the airline was that it was going to be customercentric that’s what our focus was going to be it seems like a nobrainer in a service business but i think the airline industry had lost sight of it that’s what really created our opportunityand what’s interesting if you look across the industry most of the lowcost models the new entrants have disappeared you’re left with two in virgin america and jetblue who really have tried to stay customercentricat the other end of the spectrum you’ve still got a spirit that’s gone really really low cost and really low price i’m a little worried about the spirit model in the longer run but you’re exactly right that’s partly because they’ve been absolutely obsessed with making sure that their costs didn’t get away from them they’ve been able to deliver a product at a price that allows some people to travel that probably otherwise couldn’t have traveledthe fact is there’s an insatiable demand for travel in this country at some price what they’ve tried to respond to is exactly that point they’ve done it with almost an obsessive focus you have to compliment themwhat worries me about the model is so often someone you know that took it and thought it was a great deal comes back and says i’ll never ride it again that may not be true the next time they need to go some place they may absolutely go back and do it again but i just wonder how sustainable a model that is so far so good they’re enormously profitable they’re doing a great job of continuing the focus that they established for themselvesbut i don’t know i have no interest personally in being involved with a business that people hate on the other hand it’s been pretty rewarding for spirit they’ve done a good job for their investors even though they’ve made their customers unhappy they’ve done a good job for their investorsthis is more fun the parallels are obvious each carrier has pursued their own niche we are very conscious of what we’re doing in terms of providing a different better exciting product they’re very conscious of what they’re doing of providing the lowest price in the marketdmn when did you first get involved with virgin americacarty very early i was an original investordmn planning for virgin america began in  didn’t itcarty yeah i became chairman when we kind of formed a board in  just when we were putting the original investors togetherit started a little earlier than my involvement because richard virgin group founder richard branson had this idea that he wanted to have an american carrier and he knew that he’d have to cede control of that carrier to whoever his investors were but he also didn’t want to hesitate so he got started with this thing even made some aircraft commitments even before the other investors were identified and we formed a board and i became the chairman at that timethat’s part of what caused a lot of the anxiety around the transportation department in terms of determining this a qualified american carrier because richard had initiated this without us investorsdmn and led to original ceo fred reid’s ouster at the insistence of dot officialscarty it’s really quite surprising that the dot chose to do that but there is not much doubt that fred reid was engaged before the us investors were involved richard indeed did pick fred reid the point we kept trying to make to dot is that richard may have hired him but we were the only people who could fire himdmn virgin america slowed its growth several years ago to what extent has virgin america had to adjust its modelcarty the reality of virgin america is there were a number of things that in hindsight probably weren’t great decisions that had to be redone but they weren’t about its business model as much about its operating modelfor example fred chose a reservation system that simply wasn’t going to be robust enough to be the future reservation system of the company so when we made a decision that we had to transition to sabre that of course is a tremendous diversion of management attention you can’t keep growing at an accelerated rate when you’re replumbing the heart of the airlinethere were three or four decisions like that where we just made naïve mistakes i think we had a maintenance system didn’t make any sense our allocation of internal and external work between line maintenance and major overhaul maintenance was not very workable at the station levelso a number of things that had to be retooled and all that against the backdrop of some very rollercoaster times in the industrywe started off with an airline that – because we didn’t get transportation department approval – had airplanes on the ground and paying leases for them for months before the department allowed us to flydmn that burns a lot of moneycarty a lot of money and then right after that of course the price of fuel peaked we of all airlines couldn’t hedge one we probably didn’t have a strong enough balance sheet to do a lot of hedging but we could have done some but we didn’t want to hedge for fuel we weren’t sure we’d be able to use because we didn’t know whether we were going to be able to fly or notwe took really hard hits right up frontone of the additional reasons for the slowdown was to get focused on our balance sheet and get the company in the financial position to grow i think it was a combination of things but during those transitions i don’t think from the consumers’ point of view we really ever changed our business modeldmn how would you characterize the success of flying to dallasfort worth airportcarty really quite good we were pleased how quickly dfw ramped we did chicago in about the same time frame dfw ramped much more quickly than chicagodmn then why move to dallas love field and go up against southwest airlinescarty the answer is pretty clear the love field opportunity allows us to offer our unique product attributes in contrast to our competitor who’s obviously very effective but does not offer a lot of the product attributes that we do it puts us in a market where we’re kind of the premium carrier with the premium product and we think there’s a huge amount of demand for that in downtown dallas just the feedback we’ve received from people who either fly southwest now or fly american now but would like to use love field has been pretty overwhelmingthat plus the fact that look this is a restricted airport having assets in a  restricted airport has always been a good thing in the airline business whether it’s laguardia or washington national as long as you’re the one that has them and we’ve been the carrier that hasn’t had them in a number of situations we took three years fighting for slots at newark view comments sponsored
