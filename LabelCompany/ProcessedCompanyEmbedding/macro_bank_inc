about us the beginning republic act  otherwise known as the rural bank act of  was brought about by the need to provide farmers fisherman and rural folks who constituted  of the population access to credit this is to give them opportunity to improve the quality of their lives as they participate in the countryside activities from growth and development also to stimulate private investments in order that this particular sector of our nation may participate in countryside nation building our country then was on its way to full recovery from the destructive effect of the war and was very anxious to attain full progress this ra  became a call for progress one of the first to answer this call is mr isidro b liamzon sr of montalban rizal he established marikina valley rural bank in  making it the second oldest rural bank in the country in pateros a group of sociallyconscious people led by anatolio b cruz saw the need of putting up a bank to serve the needs of the people including its neighboring towns rural bank of pateros inc rbpi was established and incorporated on august   in the year  mr cruz and his group sold their stockholdings to mr liamzon whose reputation as banker was well respected and recognized in and out of the banking industry he placed the stocks in the name of his corporation i b liamzon and sons inc in those days mr liamzon had already established several rural banks in the province of rizal from then on rbpi enjoy the trust and confidence of the people in the same manner that “balut” was closely identified with the town of pateros so with rbpi the people called it their rural bank and indeed it was for sometime it had the reputation of the only bank in pateros and the name carrier of the town we can rightfully claim that rbpi gave the people of pateros their first bank exposure sincere to its commitment of providing the countryside with basic banking needs the bank fulfilled its role of assisting the small and medium enterprises in their initial and additional capital requirements going through the loan portfolio of the bank you will discover its diverse purposes a proof that the bank is committed to carry it’s’ mission with the adoption of a more liberalized banking system by the central bank of the philippines – now banko sentral ng pilipinas rbpi found itself working side by side with its peers in an atmosphere of healthy competition in september  its first branch was established in angono rizal the following year another branch was opened in morong  april   also a town of rizal the primary reason of rbpi in putting up these two branches was to enhance the bank’s agriculturerelated capabilities in august  the bank has its third branch opened this is in dasmariñas cavite instead of putting it up in the town proper it was built in the barrio of bagumbayan the purpose is to serve the barrio folks including the students from nearby schools and universities the commercial developments that took place in bagumbayan for the last six years were overwhelming we are proud to say that we are one of the first bank who took the initiative since rbpi is growing it cannot be helped but changed its business name to a more appropriate one in  rural bank of pateros inc became…first macro bank serious to its role as a partner in countryside development fmb opened its other branches and micro banking offices mbo’s in

earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp

money better  ubs together you are using an outdated browser please upgrade to a newer one together how can we make better investments investment is an important pillar of the financial system but how can we assess risk predict the future avoid mistakes and make smarter more profitable investments we speak with the economic experts who’ve dedicated themselves to understanding human and market behavior can we avoid the next financial crisis what can we learn from the financial crisis nobel laureate joseph e stiglitz doesn’t mince his words as one of the most wellknown economists working today he carries his signature moral compass everywhere he goes so it’s no wonder he takes a big interest in the recent financial crisis where he says more could have been done to avoid the worst “my theories had explained why it was so important to regulate and since one of the central problems with the financial market was gathering information we should not expect the financial sector to work well” so stiglitz at least partly blames the economists whose theories said there was no need for regulations and while he says there’s no overnight fix he thinks it is possible to rewrite the rules find out how from stiglitz what does the financial sector need to reestablish trust laureate robert merton strongly believes that to leave the financial crisis behind us trust needs to be reestablished between the financial sector and the people it serves he knows this can be done and it’s to everyone’s benefit that it is if you can create trust you can create a huge amount of value discover more with merton what will trust look like in the future myron s scholes thinks that technology’s going to play a huge part in shaping the future of finance and of trust scholes suggests that blockchain technology will revolutionize the way markets work instead of trust being invested solely in banks and other institutions we’ll all become trusted actors in a financial play the trust will come through verification of our transactions just like when we want to go a restaurant we can now access the internet to see people’s ratings technology will also speedup banking processes compressing time which will make it more difficult for anyone to cheat the system discover more with scholes can you ever eliminate risk don’t put all your eggs in one basket the saying goes the same it turns out applies to investing  although it’s a bit more complicated than that nobel laureate harry m markowitz came up with a pioneering new way to look at investment called portfolio theory it says investing can be less risky by choosing investments with different levels of risk  and assessing how they work together as a set the notion is that if you diversify enough risk will go away  that is true of uncorrelated risk but especially one who has lived through the depression or the stock market crashes we also have correlated risk… and that he says always carries a danger explore the issue with markowitz why is it so hard to beat the stock market nobel laureate paul a samuelson’s work appears to agree with markowitz when starting out in his career he had a clear vision… my dream is to create an economic model that is humane and warmhearted but that doesn’t sacrifice efficiency or progress ultimately he knew that the best economics couldn’t rely on mathematics alone so he used a rigorous scientific approach which took human and political factors into account too this produced his efficient markets hypothesis which can be neatly summed up to mean it’s very hard to beat the stock market find out more from samuelson what really influences markets taking samuelson’s work even further nobel laureate robert j shiller aimed to give “a more truthful account” of how markets work which ultimately led to his first highly influential paper in  shiller believes it was wrong to be too rigid when assessing the economy in his research he argues that instead of mathematics finance and the global economy are actually driven by people’s behavior and thinking the market is mostly driven by noneconomic things people’s fears prejudices reactions to newsstories elections and campaigns find out more from shiller what sparks economic growth though stock markets ‘may go up as well as down nobel laureate robert m solow explored what makes them move when looking into why some economies grow faster than others he originally thought the answer was the accumulation of capital  the slow process of saving investing and building infrastructure but it wasn’t the case my model was capable of including as many economic growth factors as you could think of i could say well some countries have faster population growth than others some have richer natural resources some countries save and invest more… to my surprise it turned out for the us the accumulation of capital wasn’t the most important factor in the american economy’s growth between  and  it was actually the large amount of technological change explore the issue with solow how can we predict the future the use of technology can help us predict human and market behavior in nobel laureate robert f engle’s lab he does just that they run  econometric models per day gathering data from every market in the world the aim is to examine and prove theories and explore how volatile markets behave over time but there’s a problem with longterm risk it changes that’s why engle uses stress tests for banks to see how they would perform under particular scenarios and whether they’d have enough capital how much capital would it take to rescue the entire banking system in the event of another financial crisis engle smiles today that number is about  trillion find out more from engle get new questions as they launch

complex how can we make sure technology employment our pension systems and the environment work for everyone we asked some of the world’s greatest economic experts to share their opinion with us intro film ‘will i lose my job to a robot will we still have jobs when robots take over for centuries technology has significantly improved our way of life so why are we now suspicious of new technology and afraid of what the future holds one of the obvious reasons is the fear of mass unemployment various studies say that up to  of all people might lose their jobs due to technology robots and artificial intelligence are we creating a selfdestructive force nobel laureate robert m solow believes that even though  of the us economy’s growth is driven by technological progress people will still play a vital role if they have the right skills so even if the modern technological revolution is transforming the way we do business humans can stay in the driving seat we’ve allowed for substantial amounts of our workers to be inadequately educated for modern industrial work the responsibility is on us to change that to see we educate our youth find out more from solow how do we make sure everyone benefits in the age of technology edmund s phelps also sees technology as our ticket to global prosperity but for him innovation is the vital ingredient like robert m solow he believes innovation only flourishes when people are included in it at every level of employment and not just in places like silicon valley but across the country he argues that if we don’t plug everyone into creative and innovative work it’ll be bad for the economy and society as a whole silicon valley is just a small part of the economy  innovations have stopped in the heartland of the country it’s the workingclass people deeply connected to that heartland who’ve been suffering explore the issue with phelps so what skills do we need to survive in the modern world  theodore w schultz thought it was the skills of ordinary people that mattered most in fact he had little time for the rich urban elite he believed that since most people in the world are poor it’s they who should be the focus for economists he believed the key is to make sure that the poorest in society are educated to the highest possible level and able to reach their full potential in life what’s the most important thing in economics currently it’s seeing the increase in returns from schooling and education find out more from schultz the only skill you need in life why is there unemployment when jobs are available  sir christopher has studied this question extensively and realized that existing models couldn’t explain it his research shows that the traditional supply and demand model didn’t fit the problem employment isn’t transactional it’s more like dating  the chemistry has to be right his study of the labor market was a big step forward and it’s been beneficial to governments the unemployed and society as a whole unemployment is one of the biggest failures of our economic system laureate edmund s phelps also rocked the boat when he challenged the accepted theory that inflation helped unemployment he upset traditional economists by wanting to use lifelike actors in his economic models to reflect the fact that people make decisions without having all the right information at their fingertips explore the issue with pissarides the focal point of economic attention should be on what leads to a more dynamic economy and society not just what leads to more efficient markets find out more from phelps how can we stop oldage poverty for those who manage to find employment the age in which they retire has continued to grow and grow but when it’s eventually time to throw in the towel what will future generations do when their pension system creaking under an aging population fails william f sharpe believes a growing knowledgebase and an intelligent immigration system could be the answer you need younger people to come into the economy to be productive and help the economy function and basically help support all the old people find out more from sharpe what can i live from when i am old can game theory avoid wars and help create peace technological and scientific breakthroughs are common in the defense industry so while we develop more and more efficient ways to destroy people and cities there’s also a new science that works towards preventing war nobel laureate robert j aumann used game theory to study conflict and cooperation between decision makers to develop models that might prevent wars from happening in the first place studies have already shown that being prepared for war is actually a big part of promoting peace anybody who talks about any kind of military preparedness should hope that it makes the use of military unnecessary the goal is to be prepared for war so it doesn’t have to happen explore the issue with aumann can game theory avoid wars can game theory save lives we know that game theory can help avoid wars but what about applying it to markets to save lives outside of the battlefield nobel laureate alvin e roth realized that speed dating applying to secondary school and even undergoing a potentially lifesaving organ transplant can all be seen as markets as a result he pioneered a kidney swap program it helped people wanting to donate a kidney to a loved one with an incompatible blood type to be matched with other incompatible donor pairs he also used game theory to solve the challenge of matching students with schools in big cities like new york and boston and finding the best way to match couples when speed dating so yes it appears that game theory can change and even save lives as the conditions of the market change the behavior of people change and that causes old rules to be discarded and new rules to be created  find out more from roth can we stop terrorism laureate myerson believes that by learning from past mistakes we can create a framework to advance humanity and tackle terrorism after world war ii everybody understood that the reparations scheme that was imposed after world war i was a disastrous mistake so that mistake was not going to be repeated he argues that game theory can provide this framework and that by taking into account all of the issues we can look to the root of threats like isis and tackle them creating a more peaceful world discover more with myerson can economics save the planet too nobel laureate robert m solow was interested in who should pay to keep our environment clean we often blame modern technology for increasing pollution but he believes it’s a social and economic issue technology he says could actually provide many of the answers to mopping up the mess solow reasons that the polluter should pay once people can agree on who that polluter is is it the company who makes the product the person who uses it or both the solution says solow is to add the costs of cleaning to the price of the goods that the consumer buys we know that at a cost to ourselves we can control environmental pollution what we fight about is who will pay for those costs explore the issue with solow how can people manage their own resources elinor c ostrom was the first female nobel laureate in economic sciences she believed that people are perfectly capable of taking control of important community decisions without external authorities imposing rules her extensive fieldwork focused on how people interact with ecosystems such as forests fisheries and irrigation

together how can we create a better life for everyone why is equality still so elusive while inequality is seen as normal and almost inevitable we interview the greatest economic minds in the world as they share ideas about what real economic equality might look like  and how it could be achieved across the world will we ever close the gap between the rich and the poor why is there such a large gap between the richest and the poorest nobel laureate robert m solow explored why some economies grow much faster than others and why economic growth is stagnant in some parts of the world while elsewhere there’s been rapid industrialization he argued that there was no economic need for such a sharp contrast between the world’s ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ and firmly believed that economics could be used to improve equality the science of economics should teach us not only how to increase the wealth of all of us but to share the wealth more equally than we do find out more from solow real gdp growth  image imf source world economic outlook april  does wealth always improve your life there’s no question that achieving equality is one of the world’s most important and complicated challenges but how do we measure poverty and will money always make people happier acknowledging the disparity of wealth in the world nobel laureate sir angus s deaton says money isn’t always the answer to inequality – especially when people’s lives can be improved by better healthcare and education in fact financial aid can make things worse it’s very difficult to overcome the simplistic view that if you’re poor and i’m rich and i give you money that’ll make you better off explore the issue with deaton why do some countries get stuck in poverty growing up in st lucia during the first world war nobel laureate sir arthur lewis had firsthand experience of the ‘have nots’ as the country was very poor and still dealing with the aftermath of slavery he described an economy with a modern capitalist sector and an underdeveloped sector  which led to inequality and lower wages his work on economic development and why some countries get stuck in cycles of poverty challenged the thinking of the time high levels of unemployment allow an urban entrepreneurial class to exploit plentiful labor they enjoy the profits of their development while people at the bottom of society don’t progress at all and unemployment becomes indigenous to the system as a whole find out more from lewis so how can we tackle inequality how can we make sure that the world’s poor have better lives nobel laureate paul r krugman was interested in income equality arguing that people should earn enough money not just for food and shelter but enough to be able to really take part in society he thought this should come in the form of a basic income for everybody but is this really an achievable reality or just a farfetched utopian dream there are things we know we can do and things we think we can do but we should be doing all of them redistribution taxes and transfers guaranteeing a basic income for the less fortunate paid for by taxes of the more fortunate  we can do that explore the issue with krugman can we rewrite the rules of our economy to achieve equality nobel laureate joseph e stiglitz says there’s no easy overnight way to do this but he also says that if we wrote the rules to make the economy more unequal we should now be able to rewrite them too give workers more bargaining rights curb the power of corporations create better corporate governance keep checks and balances on the financial sector there is an agenda that can promote strong growth in the us economy find out more from stiglitz can we use tax to make things fairer for the many laureate sir james a mirrlees is an expert in development economics and developing systems that create fairness for everyone in society it’s about getting rid of poverty and poor education he says to make the poorest wellenough off you have to take money from the rich though he concedes this is a simplistic viewpoint that doesn’t take into account the real world explore the issue with mirrlees mirrlees lives in hong kong so he’s seen firsthand the rise of china as an economic power  and how it’s lifted many of its population from poverty he suspects it’ll continue on an upwards trajectory i feel pretty sure that urban wages in the big chinese cities will be comparable with wages in the big western cities within the next  years is globalization helping or hindering equality we’ve all witnessed the world becoming increasingly interconnected not just the products and services we use but also our culture while globalization has been taking place for hundreds of years it has sky rocketed over the last halfcentury has this hyperglobalization created inequality or spread the wealth it doesn’t appear to have helped close the gap between the richest and the poorest but it has been good for developing countries nobel laureates paul r krugman and joseph estiglitz point out that one of the positives has been the huge rise of middle classes in countries like china and india this means that hundreds of millions of previously deprived people are now relatively well off will china rule the world it’s not just about the economy what about gender equality women could add  trillion to the global economy in the next decade  their wealth is growing faster than men’s but gender equality still hasn’t come far enough despite obvious steps forward in recent decades in fact the world economic forum predicts the
