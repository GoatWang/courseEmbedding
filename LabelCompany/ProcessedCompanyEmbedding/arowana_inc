office space utilities and secretarial support the foregoing arrangement is being agreed to by arowana international for our benefit and is not intended to provide our executive officers compensation in lieu of a salary we believe based on rents and fees for similar services in north sydney australia that the fee charged by arowana international is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person this arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation other than the  monthly administrative fee no compensation of any kind including finder’s consulting or other similar fees will be paid to any of our existing officers directors shareholders or any of their affiliates prior to or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of the business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after a business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately  in addition the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account after payment of taxes owed on such interest income may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination we intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above we will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe we intend to use the aftertax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account to acquire a target business to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto including a fee payable to earlybirdcapital equal to  of the gross proceeds raised in this offering exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable upon consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business combination if the payment of our liabilities including the fee payable to earlybirdcapital were to reduce the amount available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account we would not be able to consummate such transaction to the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto which could include the up to  payable to earlybirdcapital described above if the overallotment option is exercised in full will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient kevin chin has agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of february   arowana partners group pty ltd loaned to us an aggregate of  to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for sec registration fee finra filing fee the nonrefundable portion of the nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses the loan is payable without interest on the earlier of i october   ii the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or iii the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering the loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses if we determine not to proceed with the offering such amounts would not be repaid in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering until completion of an initial business combination our initial shareholders officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of  per unit which for example would result in the holders being issued  ordinary shares if  of notes were so converted since the  rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of  shares upon the closing of our business combination as well as  warrants to purchase  shares our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete our initial business combination the loans would not be repaid a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on his her or its portion of the trust account to the extent not previously released to us only in the event of i our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required time period or ii if that public shareholder converts such public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses •our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction •our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination •nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination •our outstanding rights warrants and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent •our obligation to pay earlybirdcapital a fee of  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon consummation of our initial business combination •our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to  of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates •our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private units and underlying securities and any securities issued to our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans and •the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms furthermore the fact that we will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a cayman islands company incorporated on october   as an exempted company with limited liability exempted companies are cayman islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the cayman islands and as such are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the companies law as an exempted company we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the cayman islands government that in accordance with section  of the tax concessions law  revision of the cayman islands for a period of  years from the date of the undertaking no law which is enacted in the cayman islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits income gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and in addition that no tax to be levied on profits income gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable i on or in respect of our shares debentures or other obligations or ii by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us we were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase recapitalization reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to as a “target business” while our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world we initially intend to focus on target businesses located in the asia pacific region with a particular emphasis on south east asia and australia operating in the energy including solar and alternative energy industry or target businesses in such industry operating outside of those geographic locations which we believe would benefit from expanding their operations to such locations we do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf directly or indirectly contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions formal or otherwise with respect to such a transaction we will either  seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account net of taxes payable or  provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account net of taxes payable in each case subject to the limitations described herein notwithstanding the foregoing our initial shareholders have agreed pursuant to written letter agreements with us not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval unlike other blank check companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the securities and exchange commission or sec in that case we will file tender offer documents with the sec which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the sec’s proxy rules we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least  upon such consummation and solely if we seek shareholder approval a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination we will have until  months from the consummation of this offering to consummate our initial business combination if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within this time period we will liquidate the trust account and distribute the proceeds held therein to our public shareholders and dissolve if we are forced to liquidate we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date including any accrued interest prior to such distribution we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them we cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us as such our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation pursuant to the nasdaq listing rules our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to  of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses the fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community such as actual and potential sales earnings cash flow andor book value the target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of  of the trust account balance we are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least  of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own we are also not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless the target is affiliated with our officers directors initial shareholders or their affiliates we currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act even if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the posttransaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the  of net assets test we view all of the provisions relating to our proposed offering structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we nor our officers or directors will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares into the right to receive cash from the trust account in connection with any such vote the foregoing is set forth in our amended and restated
