mathematical group theory given a prime number p a pgroup is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order that is for each element g of a pgroup there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g and not less is equal to the identity element the orders of different elements may be different powers of p such groups are also called pprimary or simply primary a finite group is a pgroup if and only if its order the number of its elements is a power of p given a finite group g the sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of g the existence of a subgroup of g of order pn the remainder of this article deals with finite pgroups for an example of an infinite abelian pgroup see prüfer group and for an example of an

links propertiesedit every pgroup is periodic since by definition every element has finite order nontrivial centeredit one of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a nontrivial finite pgroup cannot be the trivial subgroup this forms the basis for many inductive methods in pgroups for instance the normalizer n of a proper subgroup h of a finite pgroup g properly contains h because for any counterexample with hn the center z is contained in n and so also in h but then there is a smaller example hz whose normalizer in gz is nzhz creating an infinite descent as a corollary every finite pgroup is nilpotent in another direction every normal subgroup of a finite pgroup intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of n which are fixed when g acts on n by conjugation since every central subgroup is normal it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite pgroup is central and has order p indeed the socle of a finite pgroup is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p if g is a pgroup then so is gz and so it too has a nontrivial center the preimage in g of the center of gz is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series generalizing the earlier comments about the socle a finite pgroup with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with  ≤ i ≤ n and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center zi if a normal subgroup is not contained in zi then its intersection with zi has size at least pi automorphismsedit the automorphism groups of pgroups are well studied just as every finite pgroup has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group every finite pgroup has a nontrivial outer automorphism group every automorphism of g induces an automorphism on gφg where φg is the frattini subgroup of g the quotient gφg is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group so very well understood the map from the automorphism group of g into this general linear group has been studied by burnside who showed that the kernel of this map is a pgroup examplesedit pgroups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic for example the cyclic group c and the klein fourgroup v are both groups of order  but they are not isomorphic nor need a pgroup be abelian the dihedral group dih of order  is a nonabelian group however every group of order p is abeliannote  the dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups together the dihedral semidihedral and quaternion groups form the groups of maximal class that is those groups of order n and nilpotency class n iterated wreath productsedit the iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of pgroups denote the cyclic group of order p as w and the wreath product of wn with w as wn   then wn is the sylow psubgroup of the symmetric group sympn maximal psubgroups of the general linear group glnq are direct products of various wn it has order pk where k  pn − p −  it has nilpotency class pn− and its lower central series upper central series lower exponentp central series and upper exponentp central series are equal it is generated by its elements of order p but its exponent is pn the second such group w is also a pgroup of maximal class since it has order pp and nilpotency class p but is not a regular pgroup since groups of order pp are always regular groups it is also a minimal such example generalized dihedral groupsedit when p   and n   wn is the dihedral group of order  so in some sense wn provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n   however for higher n the analogy becomes strained there is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order n but that requires a bit more setup let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers let zζ be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it and let p be the prime ideal generated by −ζ let g be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z form the semidirect product ep of zζ and g where z acts as multiplication by ζ the powers pn are normal subgroups of ep and the example groups are epn  eppn epn has order pn and nilpotency class n so is a pgroup of maximal class when p   en is the dihedral group of order n when p is odd both w and epp are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp but are not isomorphic unitriangular matrix groupsedit the sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples let v be a vector space of dimension n with basis  intomega du  intdelta show
