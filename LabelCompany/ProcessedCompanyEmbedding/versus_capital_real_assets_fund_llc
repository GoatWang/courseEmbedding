regardless of how the fund performs real estate is subject to special risks among which are tenant default environmental problems and adverse changes in local economic conditions the yield from an underlying investment fund could be significantly reduced if it fails to qualify as a reit real estate investment trust for tax purposes the funds investments also may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment although the fund is intended to provide a means by which investors can diversify their portfolios into real estate the fund itself is nondiversified under the investment company act of  since changes in the market value of a single holding may cause a greater fluctuation in the funds net asset value than in a diversified fund the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program investors are reminded that portfolio diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss a multimanager strategy involves certain risks for example the success of the fund depends in large part upon the ability of the adviser to choose successful investment managers it is possible that some investment managers may take similar market positions thereby interfering with the funds investment goal the fund and underlying investment managers may borrow as an investment strategy the fund intends to limit borrowing to one third of its gross asset value while borrowing presents opportunities to increase the funds total return it potentially increases the losses as well under certain circumstances the funds distribution policy could result in a return of capital potentially causing the funds expense ratio to increase the adviser subadviser and investment mangers manage portfolios for themselves and for clients other than the fund a conflict between the interests of the fund and the interests of these other parties may arise in certain situations which potentially could disadvantage the fund for example a suitable but limited investment

assets that have value due to their substance and properties real assets include precious metals commodities real estate agricultural land machinery and oil they are appropriate for inclusion in most diversified portfolios because of their relatively low correlation with financial assets such as stocks and bondsbreaking down real assetinvesting in real assets is particularly wellsuited for inflationary times because of their tendency to outperform financial assets during such periodsmost businesses own a range of assets and they typically fall into the real financial or intangible category for example imagine xyz company owns a fleet of cars a factory and a great deal of equipment these are real assets however the company also owns several trademarks and copyrights these are intangible assets finally the company has a few stocks in a sister company which are financial assetsdifference between real assets and financial assetsreal assets are a separate and distinct asset class from financial assets unlike real assets which have intrinsic value financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim on an underlying asset which may be real or intangible for example commodities and property are real assets but commodity futures exchangetraded funds etfs and real estate investment trusts reits constitute financial assets whose value depends on the underlying real assetsadvantages and disadvantages of real assetsreal assets tend to be more stable than financial assets inflation shifts in currency values and other macroeconomic factors affect real assets less than financial assets however real assets also have lower liquidity than financial assets as they take longer to sell and have higher transaction fees in general finally real assets have higher carrying and storage costs than financial assetsdifference between financial assets and intangible assetsintangible assets include trademarks brand recognition and other intangible items but this asset category does not include stocks and bonds similarly financial assets include stocks and bonds but the category does not include goodwill patents or other intangible assetsdifference between tangible and intangible assetstangible assets include stocks bonds property cash vehicles and a host of other things while intangible assets include only a small sliver of items tangible assets include both financial and real assets while intangible assets include items that exclusively fall into the intangible categoryfor tax purposes the internal revenue service irs requires businesses to report intangible assets differently than tangible assets but it groups real and financial assets together under the tangible asset umbrella bluerock total income real estate fund tiprx

nolocom grow your legal practice meet the editors sign in support search search type all products lawyers articles search term location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies running an llc funding your llc most llcs need to raise capital to get started with their business read about some of the more commonlyused options for obtaining funding by diana fitzpatrick jd share on google plus share on facebook an essential element of starting a successful limited liability company llc is properly funding your llc   many new businesses fail because they lack sufficient capital to survive their initial startup phase   a detailed effective business plan may be an important initial step in raising funds so that you can illustrate to potential investors and lenders your ability to pay back loans or to reach profitability over time   there are numerous options available for funding your llc and here are some major avenues for you to consider evaluate your own assets   many future business owners look first to their personal assets to fund their new venture either by liquidating these assets or using them as collateral for loans   in some instances you might tap your personal cash savings and sell valuable personal or real property such as your home to raise cash for your new llc   if you have equity in your home you may decide to seek out a home equity loan to help finance your business   but beware that if you are unable to make your home loan payments you will lose not only your new business but also a roof over your head if you have retirement accounts you may be able to borrow from them to finance your startup for limited time periods   however there may be hefty withdrawal fees and tax penalties for removing funds and not paying them back within required time periods contact your personal network for informal loans just about every entrepreneur has shared their dream of starting their own business with family and friends   you have your strongest personal connections with those in your family and social circles those who know you best are likely to be more willing to put their trust in you and their cash behind your startup   this informal financing may be easy to obtain but may create longterm trouble in your family and social relationships if the money is not paid back   if you feel comfortable with this potential risk it may be worthwhile to reach out to your personal network for financial support invite new members to your llc team   bringing in additional members may be another option for funding your startup   although you may want to go solo think about the value of adding other llc members or owners for funding purposes   you can pool together your financial resources with your other members to support your new venture   with other members you also broaden your llc’s social network of business contacts and hopefully potential investors  aside from raising more funds for your llc new members may also yield the added benefits of learning from your fellow owners’ professional experiences   look into credit cards for shortterm financing   many individuals may try to start out their business using personal credit cards such as the entrepreneurs who started google   many credit card services also offer business credit cards which may have low or no annual fees competitive interest rates and travel rewards and cash back based on business purchases   credit cards can provide immediate credit without the paperwork of loan applications or business plans   since credit card interest can be quite high new business owners may want to view credit cards as shortterm solutions for llc needs which should be paid back quickly   avoid racking up large amounts of extended credit card debt that could make this fast process for financing very costly longterm apply for conventional loans from institutional lenders   you might try the traditional route of seeking loans from banks and credit unions   you will need a formal business plan as part of your loan application process   many conventional lenders may be wary of inexperienced business people so don’t be surprised if you face a great deal of rejection   borrowing against existing collateral may improve your chances of gaining financing but it is likely to be a challenging path if you decide to use your assets as collateral for an institutional loan recognize that your failure to repay these business loans will mean the loss of your underlying collateral   check out governmentsponsored grant and loan programs   federal state and local governments may offer special grant or loan programs through traditional lenders or nonprofit intermediaries to help finance your business   these governmentsponsored programs may target  types of industries such as alternative energy  certain business owners such as military veterans  designated geographic locations such as economically disadvantaged communities or  particular dollar amounts such as microloans that may start at amounts as small as    the small business administration sba offers an online search tool for identifying loans and grant programs that may apply to your startup connect with peertopeer lending sites   in the past few years peertopeer pp or social lending websites have begun to emerge on the web   these pp sites offer opportunities for creditworthy business people to seek out funding from individual or institutional investors you can apply for a loan online through these sites and investors with site accounts can decide whether or not they wish to fund your proposed business through interestbased loans these pp sites are online alternatives to traditional lending institutions and are expected to continue to grow as quick confidential sources of new business funding some wellknown pp sites are lending club  and prosper share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need help start here practice

include oil and natural gas metals and minerals and agriculture and timber we opportunistically consider other real assets sectors though we do not invest in commercial or residential real estate we have a bias toward smaller often less efficient investment opportunities but will consider any opportunity provided the capitalization is rightsized for the strategy across all sectors we seek investments where opportunities exist to add significant value post investment we favor strategies focused on equity investments but may selectively consider credit and debtoriented strategies investments that depend on high leverage or technological innovation to generate returns are typically avoided oil and natural gas primary focus on upstream with select consideration of midstream and productsservices preference for operated strategies focused on the acquisition of working interests consideration across the development curve but generally avoid explorationfocused strategies metals and minerals consideration across the spectrum of precious metals base metals minor metals industrial minerals and bulk commodities consideration across the development curve but generally avoid explorationfocused strategies country agnostic but avoid unsafe or unproven mining jurisdictions agriculture and timber consideration across the spectrum of agriculture commodities and timber preference for productionoriented strategies select consideration of midstream and productsservices other real assets consideration of opportunistic sectors that display characteristics similar to the primary sectors listed above such as water power alternative energy and capital assets
