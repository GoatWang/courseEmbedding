revenue is from the interest income on over  million of notes receivable due from related parties we have historically engaged in and may continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties including but not limited to asset acquisition and dispositions transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arms length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms

investment policy pillar also serves as an advisor and cash manager to tci and arl critical accounting policies we present our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the fasb accounting standards codification asc is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap as of the effective date we no longer refer to the authoritative guidance dictating its accounting methodologies under the previous accounting standards hierarchy instead we refer to the asc codification as the sole source of authoritative literature the accompanying financial statements include our accounts our subsidiaries generally all of which are whollyowned and all entities in which we have a controlling interest arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as a variable interest entity vie in accordance with the provisions and guidance of asc topic  consolidation whereby we have determined that we are a primary beneficiary of the vie and meet certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investors accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf  vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders as a group lack adequate decision making ability the obligation to absorb expected losses or residual returns of the entity or have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that provides financial support and bears a majority of the financial risks authorizes certain capital transactions or makes operating decisions that materially affect the entitys financial results all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we consider qualitative and quantitative factors including but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current future fair values and performance of real estate held by these vies and general market conditions for entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary the entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting accordingly our share of the net earnings or losses of these entities are included in net income our investment in tci eton square lp is accounted for under the equity method real estate upon acquisitions of real estate we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets including land buildings tenant improvements abovemarket and belowmarket leases origination costs acquired inplace leases other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with asc topic  business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates as well as available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles including acquired inplace leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals based on our acquisitions to date our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial we record acquired abovemarket and belowmarket leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between  the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and  managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixed rate renewal options for belowmarket leases a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by asc topic  interest  capitalization of interest and asc topic  real estate  general the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we cease capitalization when a building is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related expenses asc topic  property plant and equipment requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold or otherwise qualify as held for sale be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale the components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale operating results depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors or a committee thereof and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale such that the property sale within one year is considered probable following the classification of a property as held for sale no further depreciation is recorded on the assets depreciation and impairment real estate is stated at depreciated cost the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property legal fees and other acquisition costs costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized capitalized development costs include interest property taxes insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development management reviews its longlived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value if such impairment is present an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods recognition of revenue our revenues are composed of interest income on notes receivable in accordance with asc  business combinations we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place and abovemarket and belowmarket leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases as applicable revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales and the associated gains or losses of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  property plant and equipment  real estate sale the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in asc topic  related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance leasing deposit installment or cost recovery methods as appropriate until the sales criteria are met nonperforming notes receivable we consider a note receivable to be nonperforming when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement interest recognition on notes receivable we record interest income as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements allowance for estimated losses we assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis of which the assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note we recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan the amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment see note  notes and interest receivable from related parties for details on our notes

for identical and unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets level   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level   unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement related parties we apply asc topic  business combinations to evaluate business relationships related parties are persons or entities who have one or more of the following characteristics which include entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required trust for the benefit of persons including principal owners of the entities and members of their immediate families management personnel of the entity and members

controlling interest arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as a variable interest entity vie in accordance with the provisions and guidance of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  consolidation whereby we have determined that we are a primary beneficiary of the vie and meet certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investors accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf  vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders as a group lack adequate decision making ability the obligation to absorb expected losses or residual returns of the entity or have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that provides financial support and bears a majority of the financial risks authorizes certain capital transactions or makes operating decisions that materially affect the entitys financial results all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we consider qualitative and quantitative factors including but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current future fair values and performance of real estate held by these vies and general market conditions as of december   iot is not the primary beneficiary of a vie the company does not have any entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary real estate upon acquisitions of real estate we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets including land buildings tenant improvements abovemarket and belowmarket leases origination costs acquired inplace leases other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with asc  business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates as well as available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles including acquired inplace leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals based on our acquisitions to date our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial we record acquired abovemarket and belowmarket leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between  the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and  managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixed rate renewal options for belowmarket leases other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related expenses transfers to or from tci or other related parties reflect a sales price equal to the cost basis in the asset at the time of the sale depreciation and impairment real estate is stated at depreciated cost the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property legal fees and other acquisition costs costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized capitalized development costs include interest property taxes insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development management reviews its longlived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value if such impairment is present an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods if we determine that impairment has occurred the affected assets must be reduced to their face value asc  property plant and equipment requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold or otherwise qualify as held for sale be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale the components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale operating results depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the companys board of directors or its executive committee thereof and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale such that the property sale within one year is considered probable following the classification of a property as held for sale no further depreciation is recorded on the assets a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by asc  interest  capitalization of interest and asc  real estategeneral the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity we cease capitalization on the portion  substantially completed and  occupied or held available for occupancy and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction recognition of revenue our revenues are composed largely of interest income on notes receivable revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales and the associated gains or losses of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc  property plant and equipment  real estate sale the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in asc  related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met we defer some or all of the revenue or gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance leasing deposit installment or cost recovery methods as appropriate until the full revenue recognition sales criteria are met nonperforming notes receivable the company considers a note receivable to be nonperforming when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement interest recognition on notes receivable we record interest income as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements allowance for estimated losses we assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis of which the assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note we recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan the amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnerships real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment see note  below notes and interest receivable from related parties for details on our notes receivable fair value measurement the company applies the guidance in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures to the valuation of real estate assets these provisions define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants at the measurement date establish a hierarchy that prioritizes the information used in developing fair value estimates and require disclosure of fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable data level  measurements such as the reporting entitys own data the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and includes three levels defined as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical and unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets level quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement management reviews the carrying values of our properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicates that impairment may exist impairment is considered to exist if the future cash flow from a property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property the property review generally includes  selective property inspections  a review of the propertys current rents compared to market rents  a review of the propertys expenses related parties we apply asc  business combinations to evaluate business relationships related parties are persons or entities who have one or more of the following characteristics which include entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required trust for the benefit of persons including principal owners of the entities and members of their immediate families management personnel of the entity and members of their immediate families and other parties with which the entity may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the decision making of the other to an extent that
