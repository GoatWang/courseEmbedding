story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit photo illustration by the new york times little red flags jut out from the shelves at a cvs drugstore in suburban boston alerting shoppers to shortages of nearly a dozen johnson  johnson products among them are motrin rolaids children’s tylenol liquid and adult tylenol mylanta pepcid ac and even some neutrogena skin care products“looking for tylenol pain relief products” asks one of the signs the notices at cvs serve as a stark reproof to johnson  johnson whose brands have for more than a century been synonymous with quality some of its products are in short supply at drugstores and supermarkets because the mcneil consumer healthcare unit of j j last year recalled about  million items including about  million bottles of liquid tylenol motrin zyrtec and benadryl for infants and childrenjohnson  johnson has had to recall such a variety of products because of qualitycontrol problems across product lines in multiple factories and in several units last year some of its consumer products for instance may have contained bits of metal others came in bottles with a moldy smell and some products have gone missing from stores with hardly an explanation all of this has put the company and its manufacturing under the intense scrutiny of lawmakers and officials at the food and drug administration“it looks like a plane spinning out of control” says david vinjamuri a former j j marketing employee who now trains brand managers at his company thirdway brand trainers advertisement continue reading the main story while the drugstore signs that helpfully suggest “try cvspharmacy brand” are intended to assist frustrated shoppers in identifying alternatives to missing brandname products they also serve as constant reminders of another of j j’s continuing problems it must persuade millions of disappointed customers to once again pay a premium for products that may no longer seem to be of any higher quality than the less expensive store brand continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “i don’t even consider buying them any more” says thienkim lam a mother of two and a blogger in silver spring md in a post last spring titled “makers of tylenol i’m disappointed in you” on the blog dc metro moms ms lam wrote about the huge recall of j j infants’ and children’s medicinesnow she says the frequent recalls have prompted her to switch to generic cold and cough medicines for her children “it’s like a breakup” she says “i’m done i’ve moved on”bonnie jacobs a mcneil spokeswoman says the company is committed to restoring mcneil’s reputation as a worldclass manufacturer of overthecounter medicines “we will invest the necessary resources and make whatever changes are needed to do so and we will take the time to do it right” she wrote in an email last thursdayif queen elizabeth ii had been the chief executive of johnson  johnson she might have called  an “annus horribilis”j j’s troubles with some of its consumer products began in earnest last january when mcneil recalled millions of pill bottles after some consumers complained that they smelled like mold by december when it recalled  million packages of rolaids soft chews that may have been contaminated with metal or wood particles the company had closed one plant in fort washington pa for an overhaul and had yet to solve the quality problems at another in puerto ricothe response of j j’s chief executive william c weldon has been to allocate more than  million to upgrade mcneil’s plants and equipment appoint new manufacturing executives hire a thirdparty consulting firm to improve procedures and systems at mcneil and shore up quality control companywide in congressional testimony last fall he promised that when the pennsylvania plant reopened it would “represent the state of the art in medicine production” and he has repeatedly tried to reassure consumers as he did when he promised that j j had “no higher concern than providing parents with the highestquality products for their children”those reassurances however have been followed by yet more recalls what is most perplexing is the seeming inability of executives to solve — and satisfactorily explain — the manufacturing issues that dog the company federal regulators have continued to fault the mcneil unit for failing to identify and address systemic problems at its plants and consumers remain mystified about why simple products like ob tampons can disappear from drugstore shelves advertisement continue reading the main story in july mcneil submitted a plan to the fda detailing how it intends to overhaul its operations to comply with regulatory standards mcneil is undertaking thorough manufacturing and qualitycontrol reviews for all its products ms jacobs saysthat means the recalls may continue last thursday ms jacobs said the company would “take whatever steps are needed to ensure our products meet quality standards including further recalls if warranted”only a day later mcneil recalled  million units of sudafed sinutab benadryl and other drugs from wholesalers because of issues like inadequate equipment cleaning practices the company said that the recalls were not a result of health problems and that consumers could continue to use the productsjohnson  johnson with about  billion in sales in  makes thousands of different kinds of products including bandaids baby shampoo cardiac stents and advanced drug treatments for rheumatoid arthritis it solidified a reputation for product quality with a company credo dating from  saying that the company owed its first responsibility to the mothers and fathers doctors nurses and patients who use its productswith such a diversity of products and operating companies johnson  johnson’s overall business has not suffered significantly but the string of recent recalls at mcneil threatens to weaken the kind of trust that made many people willing to pay more for j j brands“nothing is more valuable to johnson  johnson than the brand bond of trust with consumers” says erik gordon a professor at the ross school of business at the university of michigan “but this is almost like ‘if it’s an evennumbered day it’s time for another quality problem at johnson  johnson’ ”and as the signs in cvs indicate competitors — whether drugstore brands or other household names like advil from pfizer or triaminic from novartis — have muscled into the shelf space vacated while j j puts its plants in order in the year ended on dec  for example sales of children’s liquid tylenol and motrin decreased  percent or more while drugstore brands have gained  percent according to the symphonyiri group a market research firm that tracks massmarket sales excluding those at walmart photo william weldon of j j told congress that when a troubled plant reopened it would “represent the state of the art” credit kevin wolfassociated press mark mandel a father in chicago says his family previously bought infants’ tylenol and motrin drops on the assumption that the branded products were of better quality than generics but to regain his business now mr mandel says j j would have to demonstrate that it had better manufacturing standards advertisement continue reading the main story “there were reasons we weren’t buying generics before” says mr mandel a microbiologist at the feinberg school of medicine at northwestern “but they are lower than the concerns we have about johnson  johnson right now”yougov brandindex a market research firm that tracks consumer attitudes says it has noticed a steady albeit not steep erosion over the last  months in how consumers perceive not just drug brands like tylenol but also j j while many consumers are still loyal says ted marzilli a senior executive at the firm the company needs to avoid death by a thousand cuts“they’ve really got to stop the bleeding” mr marzilli says “what the company really needs to do is not have any more recalls for six months nine months  months”ms jacobs says the company intends to “build back our brands by producing the reliable highquality products that consumers expect of us and we expect of ourselves”consumers have typically been willing to forgive a brand for one incident or product problem industry analysts say if a company acts swiftly to rectify the situation and to issue an apology — as j j did in  when seven people died in the chicago area after a tampering incident in which tylenol was laced with cyanidethe most recent recalls of tylenol and other products have been more of an inconvenience to consumers than a serious health risk federal officials have said there was no evidence that deficiencies in the recalled products caused severe illness or deathbut the number and variety of problems have stirred concern among government officials and consumers that the mcneil unit has suffered from a systemic breakdown of its manufacturing procedures last may the house committee on oversight and government reform opened an investigation into the recallsquestions are still swirling around another event described by some house committee members as a “phantom recall” in  — in which mcneil hired outside contractors to quietly buy back certain defective motrin products from store shelves the products did not dissolve properly a problem that could cause the pills to work less effectively advertisement continue reading the main story last week the state of oregon filed a lawsuit accusing johnson  johnson and mcneil of misrepresenting the quality and efficacy of those products“they did not want the negative publicity that would come with admitting they had a defective product the negative publicity that comes with any recall” john kroger oregon’s attorney general saidms jacobs of mcneil said the unit’s actions “were consistent with applicable law and there was no health or safety risk to consumers associated with this limited recall” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a

the allegations she said and would seek to have the lawsuit dismissedbut mr weldon while saying that he believed mcneil had acted with good intentions has emphasized that in retrospect the company should have handled things differently“this episode was not a model for how i would like to see johnson  johnson companies approach problems with defective products when they arise” he said during congressional testimony last septembernothing better illustrates johnson  johnson’s difficulties in remedying mcneil’s woes — and the longstanding frustration of federal regulators — than the events at the company’s plant in las piedras puerto rico consumers started complaining as early as april  about moldysmelling tylenol arthritis caplets that they said nauseated them or gave them stomach problemsmcneil did not alert the fda until september  and then didn’t start a substantial recall until december  — during an fda inspection of the plant according to fda documentsin january  the agency sent a warning letter to peter luther the president of mcneil complaining that the company’s initial investigation “was unjustifiably delayed and terminated prematurely” it said that even though consumers had also complained about a moldy smell in rolaids and extrastrength tylenol the company had not widened its investigation to include those productsonly after the fda inspection did mcneil executives recall millions of bottles of tylenol motrin benadryl and other pills the company identified an unusual source for the moldy odor chemical contamination from a byproduct of a pesticide used to treat wooden pallets it has since stopped using the pallets advertisement continue reading the main story the fda says the company should have acted faster “when something smells bad literally or figuratively companies must aggressively investigate and take all necessary actions to solve the problem” said deborah m autor director of the office of compliance at the fda center for drug evaluation and research during a press conference last yearbut johnson  johnson executives say that identifying the root cause of the problem was a difficult and lengthy process indeed fda documents indicated that the consumer complaints subsided for a time in  — leading the company to conclude the issue had gone away — only to resume months later photo drugstores like cvs are highlighting generic alternatives to products recalled by johnson  johnson some consumers say they have sworn off the name brands credit marilynn k yeethe new york times in a letter to the agency last february mr luther the mcneil president explained that the odor issue was an extremely unusual problem the investigation he wrote had been challenging because there were very few research labs able to test for the chemical later identified as the cause of the smell mcneil he assured the fda was making changes in the ways that it handled consumer complaints conducted investigations and notified the agencylast october mcneil recalled yet another lot of tylenol because consumers again complained of an odor and the next month in an inspection report the fda cited additional lapses at the puerto rico plantmcneil says that it has been working diligently to ensure that its manufacturing operations meet fda standards and that it plans to address the agency’s most recent concernsj j’s troubles have not been limited to its overthecounter products which could suggest that the company may suffer from even broader problems last year its depuy medical device unit recalled two kinds of hip implants affecting tens of thousands of patients worldwide its vision care unit recalled millions of soft contact lenses sold abroada shareholder lawsuit filed last month against johnson  johnson’s directors meanwhile catalogs a long list of “federal and state regulatory investigations subpoenas and requests for documents fda warning letters news articles and the recall of products accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of corporate losses”ms jacobs says the company intends to defend itself in courtthe manufacturing problems over the last year have clearly cost j j in the third quarter overall consumer sales in the united states fell  percent to  billion from  billion for the same period in  but sales of overthecounter medicines and nutritional products declined about  percent to  million the company said the company plans to report fourthquarter results later this month advertisement continue reading the main story while the company is estimating that the total hit to sales in  from problems at the pennsylvania plant is likely to be around  million it has begun reintroducing only a few of the products that were once available executives say they hope to get more of the missing medicines back on the shelves by the middle of this year and to reopen the plant by yearendalthough some in the industry are optimistic that the company can quickly regain its perch some wall street analysts are not convinced this month goldman sachs lowered its  earnings estimates for the company partly because of the time it might require to bring the closed plant up to the fda’s standards“we believe recovery could be slower than expected” jami rubin a goldman analyst warned investors noting that generic alternatives may now be entrenched with consumersnor has the company improved its communication with the public last year drugstores across the country started running out of ob tampons a product made by mcneilppc another company unitthe product shortage — and limited information provided by the company about the reasons behind the supply problem — caused even louder howls of frustration among some women than the children’s medicine recall“it was like a brick wall” says susan pickin a mother of a yearold daughter in manhattan describing her phone conversation with a mcneil customer service representative the conversation ms pickin says left her wondering whether the company had permanently retired the tampons because of a safety issue or whether the items might soon reappear in storesms jacobs the mcneil spokeswoman says the company discontinued the most absorbent of the products called “ultra” last year but that there had been no unusual reports of health problems the company has begun shipping other ob products now available in some storesms jacobs declined to explain the nature of the supply disruptions that caused the shortagethe variety magnitude and duration of the manufacturing and quality problems perplex some industry watchers advertisement continue reading the main story “this is really unusual to have this gross systemic failure” says donald riker the editor of otc product news an industry newsletter on overthecounter drugsthe reasons for mcneil’s woes remain unclear some critics including former employees say johnson  johnson has lost sight of its credo while others suggest that the company decentralized its oversight of manufacturing and quality control in errorothers say it was simply a matter of costcutting the december lawsuit for example cited two unnamed former employees who contended that the company failed to address the manufacturing problems at mcneil because it was trying to save moneyother former employees who are not involved in the lawsuit say that j j seemed to hesitate in recent years to invest in new manufacturing equipment“it takes a lot of money to buy equipment and maintain quality” says patrick bols who left johnson  johnson’s pharmaceutical division in the late s and owns stock in the companymcneil declined to comment on what specifically led to its manufacturing troubles but ms jacobs said the company was taking steps to address all the factors that could have contributed since last summer the company has met the monthly goals it set in its overhaul plan submitted to the fda and johnson  johnson has since revamped and centralized its qualitycontrol operations naming a longtime executive to oversee a new system of quality control across the corporation and to report directly to mr weldoneven some critics say johnson  johnson seems to be taking steps to remedy its problems “it takes a while” mr bols says “to get it right again” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think

economics  management strategy vol  issue  pp   number of pages  posted  jul  date written september   abstract this paper provides theory and evidence on airline bag fees offering insights into a realworld case of product unbundling the theory predicts that an airline’s fares should fall when it introduces a bag fee but that the full trip price the bag fee plus the new fare could either rise or fall the empirical evidence presented in the paper provides strong confirmation of this prediction the data also suggest that the average fare falls by less than the bag fee itself so that the full price of a trip rises for passengers who choose to check bags keywords unbundling airlines bag fees jel classification l suggested citation suggested citation brueckner jan k and lee darin and picard

good value great features easy to use high quality i already had three embroidery machines a futura  and a bernina  for my home i had a futura  for our vacation house our vacation house was broken into and the futura  was stolen i had already decided i like the futura features better than the bernina and was drooling over the quintet but it was unlikely the spose would agree to a th embroidery machine the break in gave me the excuse i needed so i bought a quintet i am absolutely thrilled with the whole machine not just the embroidery the features are fantastic the auto thread cutter the endless hoop and on and on it could have been a steep learning curve but all embroidery machines are i could not be more thrilled thank you robbers was this review helpful yes  no quintet delores davids  may   overall rating pros when operating correctly it works well cons too much time is taken to setup to get it to work correctly i received my futura quintet as a gift i am not a new to embroidery machines my husband purchased it based on a friends recommendations and the demonstration saw on hsn as it was a gift when i had trouble with the first one i returned it and requested a replacement although it works well it is way more difficult to set up and embroider that my past brand i find it to be extremely noisy the tangles under the throat plate continue to plague me even with the replacement proper bobbins needles thread do not make a difference  if i had purchased it myself i would get rid of it and go back to my old brand just a newer model love my husband so am very pleased that he attempted the purchase without me was this review helpful yes  no not for a beginner jaclyn kline  february   overall rating pros good value cons poor quality complicated i got my machine on line for an amazing deal and am new to embroidery when it does work it is amazing but there is a steep learning curve i have had many problems with it including tension and sensor readings for the hoop i have had to take it to the shop to get fixed three times in the first month and now waiting for a part on back order great price but too many problems was this review helpful yes  no like it but carolyn bolen  december   overall rating pros great features i love this machine some daysand other days i am so frustrated sometimes it embroideries beautiful and some days it messes up if i dont run it on low speed it jams up and breaks needles like you wont believe it gets birds nest nomatter what you do i have ruined six different projects i was doing for christmas gifts this year now im out quite a few dollars i needed  sometimes i am almost afraid to try another project i f i could afford i t id look into another machine and yet it has a lot of good features i like and for some reason the thread keeps getting caught between the top and the needle which puts stress on the needle and it breaks three more needles again today which is getting expensive but when it is working good it does a subperb job was this review helpful yes  no not as happy as i hoped i would be sharon motonfinley  june   overall rating pros good value great features cons poor quality complicated ive picked this one up via hsncom during a todays special  thought it would be easy to work with wellits not easy nor is it fun either someone else mentioned the birds nest under the work and thats what this thing does i became so frustrated with this newer model that i wentout  purchased singers older xl model which embroiders like butterthe only downside with this model is its so oldthe software conversion is even outdated and no longer supported im very tempted in selling this quintet as its way too late for me to return to hsncom maybe ill use it as another backup sewing machine without the embroidery component was this review helpful yes  no read all reviews write a review like it share it facebook twitter pinterest email easy features price creative features average

machine dorothy bonham  june   overall rating pros good value great features high quality cons a little larger than expected like the anniversary edition the looks are amazing stunning black and gold scrolls was not that easy to use at first have learned to work with it better have made many items with it now that i have become accustomed to it got it on promotion so that did make me happy was this review helpful yes  no too many little problems vicki berry  may   overall rating pros great features easy to use cons too many miscellaneous problems i have had problems with my singer  one since i received it as a gift at christmas  i managed to make it through the small problems until now those problems included error messages for errors that didnt exist thread bundling up at the bobbin case fabric not being pulled through evenly straight needles breaking by striking the pins in the fabric or breaking the pins or tension messing up now the feed dogs are stuck in the down position i didnt lower them found out when fabric was not feeding at all i cleaned and oiled the machine which didnt help but then the bobbin thread began to catch and wind itself all over i think i have that problem corrected but am at a loss for the feed dogs my  kenmore is still less a problem and more reliable than this new one was this review helpful yes  no very disappointed sharon lusky  february   overall rating pros add a pro cons poor quality i still have my mothers slant o matic and it sews great this machine sewed great for about  weeks the needle started to hit the stitch plate had it fixed now it wont hold the upper tension i should have left it in the store on the shelf was this review helpful yes  no mostly happy audrey meyer lampert  january   overall rating pros easy to use cons power foot sticks purchased mainly for quilting and so far it works well two problems ive found are  the power foot the one you put your foot on to make it go seems to stick so that when i release pressure completely the machine keeps sewing i have to tap repeatedly to unstick it bummer  machine seems to be very picky about the thread i use i have to use thread that is labeled for quilting as thinner more silky options just dont seem to want to work in this machine at all and i get repeated errors indicating the thread has broke when it hasnt ill try to replace the power foot and i dont really use it for anything other than quilting cotton so thats not a big deal to me but im guessing it would be if you are using it for sewing clothing was this review helpful yes  no i love my singer one sheri skalak  october   overall rating pros good value great features i needed a larger sewing base and chose this machine for this reason and it was affordable for me i have started quilting and find this great for piecing i have my quilts finished professionally as my skill level isnt quite there yet im sure there are many features im not using my only desire would be for an class at my local joann fabrics on the many ways to use this machine it seems that unless there is a singer representative in store this is not available i have had to learn by trial and error
