chairman president  chief executive officerthank you ed good morning everyone and thank you for joining centenes first quarter  earnings call we are very pleased to have closed the health net acquisition within the first quarter as projected i would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of health net is transformationalin closing the acquisition centene has achieved the following further critical mass including additional product diversification within the governmentsponsored healthcare space we are a  billionplus company we are the largest medicaid managed care organizations in the country serving  million medicaid members at march we are the leader in three of the largest medicaid states california texas and florida we are the largest provider of managed longterm support services one of the fastestgrowing segments of the market we have a  star medicare advantage product that can be exploited  to additional market and we provide services under contracts with the us department of defense and veterans affairs this greater scale enhances the positive view of centene nationally as well as by state and local government it strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy in addition it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspectivecentene is now clearly a largecap company in stock  we recently joined the sp  index this is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of largecap us equities additionally it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increase liquidity of our stock lastly this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of centenes longterm growth ratei would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration while the regulatory process in california was lengthier than expected it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises we will be making investments in certain stateaffiliated investmentgrade vehicles as well as in a local service center the placement of a service center in california is consistent with centenes local approachwe will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economicallydisadvantaged area where job creation is needed the investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multipleyear periodthe planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination we were able to ground running the day of the close and the integration is proceeding as expectedbefore i provide firstquarter highlights i want to remind you that our first quarter results included only eight days of health nets financials as the transaction closed on march  our prior guidance had assumed a march  close date we have updated our  guidance to reflect the latest close this is a timing issue only and we remain confident that our previouslyanticipated run rate earnings remain on trackadditionally we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix we believe this provides meaningful information to investors and it will continue to evolve as we complete the health net integrationturning to the first quarter financials we are pleased with the results of the first quarter there were many moving parts when combining the two companies including onetime charges and prorating with timing total revenues
