acquisitions corp fka kmrb acquisition corp ii milost for the fiscal year ended august   contains certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby  to the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact such statements constitute forwardlooking statements which by definition involve risks and uncertainties  in particular statements under the sections description of business managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forwardlooking statements  where in any forwardlooking statements the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished the following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated and include but are not limited to general economic financial and business conditions changes in and compliance with governmental regulations changes in tax laws and the cost and effects of legal proceedings you should not rely on forward looking statements in this annual report  this annual report contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  we use words such as anticipates believes plans expects future intends and similar expressions to identify these forwardlooking statements  prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which apply only as of the date of this annual report  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by milost acquisitions corp fka kmrb acquisition corp ii part i item  business milost acquisitions corp fka kmrb acquisition corp ii the company is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the state of florida united states of america on august   since inception the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business while operations have not commenced the company has generated expenses and no revenue from the limited efforts   the companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan implications of being an emerging growth company we qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the jumpstart our business startups act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions included i a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management discussion  analysis disclosures ii exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  iii reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements and iv no nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements we have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under rule bof the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards  we are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act  this election allows our company to delay the adoption of new or  revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates we could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii which issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding threeyear period business of issuer we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation  our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings  the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination  as a result the company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business  the business purpose of the company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with and existing company  we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business description of business principal products services  we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury or with additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as it is to the advantage of all current shareholders to advance our search for acquisition targets all shareholders will through their personal networking make known the objective of the company to potential prospective acquisition targets management furthermore will make known the availability of the companys public status to business brokers and consultants that are focused on mergers and acquisitions during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to i filing of exchange act reports and ii consummating an acquisition we anticipate that our cost for filing exchange act reports for the next  months will be approximately  we anticipate that we also should be able to consummate a business combination for approximately   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned by our invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors we are in the development stage and have negative working capital negative stockholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations to date  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company ultimately achieve profitable operations we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations in a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital  in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering  our sole officer and director has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us  any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings  in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies  in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is like to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization  this lack of diversification should be considered to a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have andor perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation we intend to contact various stock transfer agents investment relation firms and business development entities to locate potential candidates for a business combination transaction such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock  an additional perceived benefit for a private operating company in becoming public by merging with us as opposed to filing its own form  registration statement is the time and money required to get through the process this private company must take into account the consideration that such private company would have to provide to us in such a transaction as well as our obligation to file a form k in connection with such a transaction including form  information regarding the private operating company potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex number of total employees and number of fulltime employees at this time the company has no employees how long can we satisfy our cash requirements and will we need to raise additional funds in the next  months our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to investigate potential business ventures which in the opinion of management will provide a source of eventual profit to the company  such involvement may take many forms including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses  our sole officer and director mr brian kistler does not expect to remain involved as management of any acquired business   milost possesses limited funds and will be extremely limited in its attempts to locate potential business situations for investigation  the company has commenced the process of investigating possible merger and acquisition candidates and believes that the companys status as a publiclyheld corporation will enhance its ability to locate such potential business ventures  no assurance can be given as to when mr kistler may locate suitable business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to locate however mr kistler intends to actively search for potential business ventures for the foreseeable future   business opportunities if any arise are expected to become available to milost principally from the personal contacts of mr kistler  while it is not expected that the company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations such firms may be retained if funds become available in the future and if deemed advisable  opportunities may thus become available from professional advisors securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and other sources of unsolicited proposals  mr kistler is unable to predict at this time the cost of locating a suitable business opportunity   the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of mr kistler  among the factors which he will consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and financial requirements the history of operation if any future prospects the nature of present and anticipated competition  potential for further research developments or exploration growth and expansion potential the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products or services name identification and other relevant factors   it is not possible at present to predict the exact manner in which the company may participate in a business opportunity  specific business opportunities will be reviewed and based upon such review the appropriate legal structure or method of participation will be decided upon by management  such structures and methods may include without limitation leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures and may involve merger consolidation or reorganization  the company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership corporation or reorganization  however it is most likely that any acquisition of a business venture the company would make would be by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of milosts   restricted securities  such a reorganization may involve a merger or combination pursuant to state corporate statutes where one of the entities dissolves or is absorbed by the other or it may occur as a consolidation where a new entity is formed and milost and such other entity combine assets in the new entity  reorganization may also occur directly or indirectly through subsidiaries and there is no assurance that the company would be the surviving entity  any such reorganization could result in loss of control of a majority of the shares  mr kistler or other members of management if any at the time of reorganization may be required to resign in connection with reorganization  substantial dilution of percentage equity ownership may result to the stockholders  the company may choose to enter into a venture involving the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market of its securities  such a company may desire to consolidate its operations with the company through a merger reorganization asset acquisition or other combination in order to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering  such consequences might include expense time delays or loss of voting control  in the event of such a merger the company may be required to issue significant additional shares and it may be anticipated that control over the companys affairs may be transferred to others   as part of his investigation of acquisition possibilities mr kistler may meet with executive officers of the business and its personnel inspect its facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of the information provided and conduct other reasonable measures to the extent permitted by the companys limited resources and mr kistlers limited expertise  generally mr kistler intends to analyze and make a determination based upon all available information without reliance upon any single factor as controlling   it may be anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others  should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a specific business opportunity it is likely that costs already expended would not be recoverable  it is likely in the event a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated for any reason that the costs incurred by the company would not be recoverable  mr kistler is entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in his investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the company and no assurance can be given that if the company has available funds they will not be depleted by such expenses   mr kistler believes the best chance to obtain value for the stockholder is to seek a merger or acquisition with an existing business  at this time mr kistler has not been able to locate any potential mergers or acquisitions   the company is not able to determine the time or resources that will be necessary to locate and acquire or merge with a business prospect  there is no assurance that the company will be able to acquire an interest in any such prospects products or opportunities that may exist or that any activity of the company regardless of the completion of any transaction will be profitable   if and when mr kistler locates a business opportunity he will give consideration to the dollar amount of that entitys profitable operations and the adequacy of its working capital in determining the terms and conditions under which the company would consummate such an acquisition  potential business opportunities no matter which form they may take will most likely result in substantial dilution for the companys stockholders due to the issuance of stock to acquire such an opportunity we are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections  and d of the exchange act item a risk factors because we are a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item  item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties we do not own any real property  our offices are currently located at  seminole blvd seminole florida  we do not believe that we will need to obtain additional office space at any time in the foreseeable future until our business plan is more fully implemented item  legal proceedings we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings nor are any contemplated by us at this time item  mine safety disclosures not applicable part ii item  market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities market information there is presently no public market for our common stock  there is no assurance that a trading market will developed or if developed that it will be sustained  a purchaser of shares may therefore find it difficult to resell our securities offered herein should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resale holders on november   there are  shareholders of record of our common stock  there are  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding dividends since inception we have not paid any dividends on our common stock  we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock   recent sales of unregistered securities set forth below is information regarding the issuance and sales of milost acquisitions corp fka kmrb acquisition corp ii capital stock without registration since inception

plan implications of being an emerging growth company we qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the jumpstart our business startups act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions included i a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management discussion  analysis disclosures ii exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  iii reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements and iv no nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements we have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under rule bof the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards  we are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act  this election allows our company to delay the adoption of new or  revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates we could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii which issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding threeyear period business of issuer we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation  our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings  the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination  as a result the company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business  the business purpose of the company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with and existing company  we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business  we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury or with additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as it is to the advantage of all current shareholders to advance our search for acquisition targets all shareholders will through their personal networking make known the objective of the company to potential prospective acquisition targets management furthermore will make known the availability of the companys public status to business brokers and consultants that are focused on mergers and acquisitions during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to i filing of exchange act reports and ii consummating an acquisition we anticipate that our cost for filing exchange act reports for the next  months will be approximately  we anticipate that we also should be able to consummate a business combination for approximately   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned by our invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors we are in the development stage and have negative working capital negative stockholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations to date  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company ultimately achieve profitable operations we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations in a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital  in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering our sole officer and director has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us  any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings  in that event we will be  subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies  in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is like to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization  this lack of diversification should be considered to a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have andor perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation we intend to contact various stock transfer agents investment relation firms and business development entities to locate potential candidates for a business combination transaction such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock  an additional perceived benefit for a private operating company in becoming public by merging with us as opposed to filing its own form  registration statement is the time and money required to get through the process this private company must take into account the consideration that such private company would have to provide to us in such a transaction as well as our obligation to file a form k in connection with such a transaction including form  information regarding the private operating company potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex plan of operation milost is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which in the opinion of management will provide a source of eventual profit to the company  such involvement may take many forms including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses  mr kistler does not expect to remain involved as management of any acquired business   milost possesses limited funds and will be extremely limited in its attempts to locate potential business situations for investigation  the company has commenced the process of investigating possible merger and acquisition candidates and believes that the companys status as a publiclyheld corporation will enhance its ability to locate such potential business ventures  no assurance can be given as to when mr kistler may locate suitable business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to locate however mr kistler intends to actively search for potential business ventures for the foreseeable future   business opportunities if any arise are expected to become available to milost principally from the personal contacts of mr kistler  while it is not expected that the company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations such firms may be retained if funds become available in the future and if deemed advisable  opportunities may thus become available from professional advisors securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and other sources of unsolicited proposals  mr kistler is unable to predict at this time the cost of locating a suitable business opportunity   the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of mr kistler  among the factors which he will consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and financial requirements the history of operation if any future prospects the nature of present and anticipated competition potential for further research developments or exploration growth and expansion potential the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products or services name identification and other relevant factors   it is not possible at present to predict the exact manner in which the company may participate in a business opportunity  specific business opportunities will be reviewed and based upon such review the appropriate legal structure or method of participation will be decided upon by management  such structures and methods may include without limitation leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures and may involve merger consolidation or reorganization  the company may act directly or indirectly  through an interest in a partnership corporation or reorganization  however it is most likely that any acquisition of a business venture the company would make would be by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of milosts restricted securities  such a reorganization may involve a merger or combination pursuant to state corporate statutes where one of the entities dissolves or is absorbed by the other or it may occur as a consolidation where a new entity is formed and milost and such other entity combine assets in the new entity  reorganization may also occur directly or indirectly through subsidiaries and there is no assurance that the company would be the surviving entity  any such reorganization could result in loss of control of a majority of the shares  mr kistler or other members of management if any at the time of reorganization may be required to resign in connection with reorganization  substantial dilution of percentage equity ownership may result to the stockholders  the company may choose to enter into a venture involving the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market of its securities  such a company may desire to consolidate its operations with the company through a merger reorganization asset acquisition or other combination in order to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering  such consequences might include expense time delays or loss of voting control  in the event of such a merger the company may be required to issue significant additional shares and it may be anticipated that control over the companys affairs may be transferred to others   as part of his investigation of acquisition possibilities mr kistler may meet with executive officers of the business and its personnel inspect its facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of the information provided and conduct other reasonable measures to the extent permitted by the companys limited resources and mr kistlers limited expertise  generally mr kistler intends to analyze and make a determination based upon all available information without reliance upon any single factor as controlling   it may be anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others  should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a specific business opportunity it is likely that costs already expended would not be recoverable  it is likely in the event a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated for any reason that the costs incurred by the company would not be recoverable  mr kistler is entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in his investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the company and no assurance can be given that if the company has available funds they will not be depleted by such expenses   mr kistler believes the best chance to obtain value for the stockholder is to seek a merger or acquisition with an existing business  at this time mr kistler has not been able to locate any potential mergers or acquisitions   the company is not able to determine the time or resources that will be necessary to locate and acquire or merge with a business prospect  there is no assurance that the company will be able to acquire an interest in any such prospects products or opportunities that may exist or that any activity of the company regardless of the completion of any transaction will be profitable   if and when mr kistler locates a business opportunity he will give consideration to the dollar amount of that entitys profitable operations and the adequacy of its working capital in determining the terms and conditions under which the company would consummate such an acquisition  potential business opportunities no matter which form they may take will most likely result in substantial dilution for the companys stockholders due to the issuance of stock to acquire such an opportunity financial condition results of operations for year ended august   and for the period ending august   inception through august   revenues the company has no revenues expenses total expenses  total expenses for the year ended august   and for the period ending august   inception through august   were  and  respectively  total expenses included professional fees of  and   respectively and general and administrative of  and  respectively  professional fees increased by approximately   this increase was due required auditor reviews   financial condition total assets  total assets at august   and august   were  and  respectively  total assets consist of cash of  and  respectively    total liabilities  total liabilities at august   and august   were  and  respectively  total liabilities consist entirely of accounts payable liquidity and capital resources the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates among other things the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business   the company sustained a loss for the year ended august   of  as compared to the loss for the period ending august   inception through august   of   in addition the company has an accumulated deficit of  at august   because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations the company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing of products these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty we are presently unable to meet our obligations as they come due  at august   we had a working capital deficit of   our working capital deficit is due to operations net cash used in operating activities for the year ended august   and for the period ending august   inception through august   was  and  respectively  net cash used in operating activities is our net loss and further adjusted by increases and decreases in accounts payable  cash for operating activities was used by operating activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended august   and for the period ending august   inception through august   was  and  respectively  net cash provided by financing for the period ending august   inception through august   included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  we anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations pay current obligations and future capital expenditures the primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources andor debt financing  however we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations andor obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all to remain a going concern our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability  our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations and to seek merger candidates andor acquisitions although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our companys securities  we would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by regulation d rule  or conduct another private offering under section a of the securities act of   see note   going concern in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a going concern we have no known demands or commitments and are not

disclosure with our accounting firm during the reporting period item a controls and procedures a  managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the us generally accepted accounting principles as of august   under the supervision and with the participation of our management we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de promulgated under the securities exchange act of   based on this evaluation management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective so as to timely identify correct and disclose information required to be included on our securities and exchange commission sec reports due to the companys limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review  through the use of external consultants and the review process management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct as of august   under the supervision and with the participation of our management we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  and based on the criteria for effective internal control described internal control  integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely identify correct and disclose information required to be included on our securities and exchange commission sec reports due to the companys limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review  through the use of external consultants and the review process management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct the management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud  a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met  further the design of control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs  because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected  this annual report does not include an attestation report of the companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  managements report was not subject to

the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable  if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources  managements plan to obtain such resources for the company include obtaining capital from management

distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entitys own assumptions about market participant

similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means level  inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable fair value estimates discussed
