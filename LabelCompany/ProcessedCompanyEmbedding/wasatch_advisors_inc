history in  sam stewart started wasatch and put into place a new investment philosophy that was noticeably unique headquartered in salt lake city utah the firm patterns its practices of thorough rocksolid research and collaborative investing after the granite peaks that surround it over  years of growth key events     wasatch opens for business focused on smallcap growth investing for separate accounts     the firm launches its first two mutual funds small cap growth and core growth     opening of the wasatch micro cap fund the firm’s first fund in the microcap style     wasatch enters value investing with its first value fund small cap value     the firm launches its first fund with an international focus international growth     wasatch acquires the st source funds now the wasatch large cap value wasatch longshort and st source income funds over the years we have expanded products and channels  our key decision screen for new products has always been based in the following questions can we be good at it and will it make our collective team better investors the early years from small cap to value investing in  after  years of smallcap investing for separately managed accounts we launched our first two smallcap portfolios with the simple desire to open our investment approach to everyone by  we had put together a solid longterm track record in the small cap space and it didn’t take a rocket scientist to see that the same principals that formed wasatch’s foundation were completely transferable to microsized companies so in  we launched our first micro cap portfolio less intuitive was the launch of our first value portfolio two years later we had always been growth managers  we wrestled with this decision for a long time the root of the idea was that we had a competitive advantage in evaluating the longterm prospects of growth companies when they stumbled which we refer to as “fallen angels” because of the deep growth company research that we were already doing  we were frustrated because we saw some fallen angels that we were already familiar with being undervalued relative to their potential but we couldn’t fill our growth portfolios with companies that weren’t currently growing  the launch of the small cap value fund in  gave us a place to leverage these unique insights  as a result our value portfolios are often described to be “growthier value” expanding to international investing by  we had noticed a dramatic change in globalization both in the broadening markets and in the competitive set of our companies it also became increasingly easier to purchase stocks on foreign exchanges  we saw this as a longterm trend and thought that we should be better at evaluating our investment opportunities on a global scale  we created an international team and launched our first fund focused outside of the us in  the collaborative nature of our research team allowed our international learning to easily flow across the broader team and foreign holdings quickly began showing up in all of our equity portfolios  looking forward today we continue to honor our roots by being steadfast to our repeatable process that allows us to be successful in many investment segments we hope our efforts to work as a team allow us to exceed your expectations every aspect of investing—from picking the stocks to sending out the annual reports—focuses on our founding principles hard work discipline collaboration candor and responsibility our investment culture thrives in the lives of the people who live it back to about
