avenue vul variable universal life insurance policy including policy benefits policy risks and the risks associated with each variable investment option available under the policy it is qualified by the detailed explanation which follows and the terms of your vul policy  terms weve used  in this document we us and our refer to the guardian insurance  annuity company inc and you and your refer to the policyowner you can find definitions of special terms used in this prospectus at the end of this document weve used italic script to highlight these terms the first time they appear in the text what is variable life insurance and how does it work variable life insurance is intended to provide two important benefits o a death benefit that is not taxable to your beneficiary o a cash value that can grow with taxes on the growth being deferred you allocate your net premium payments and cash value among the variable investment options and the fixedrate option most of these options provide variable returns thats why its called variable life insurance if the investment options that you choose perform well the cash value of your policy will increase and the death benefit may also increase as a variable life insurance policyowner however you bear the risk of investment losses to the extent that your cash values are invested in the variable options your policy has no guaranteed cash value the policy is not generally suitable for shortterm investment purposes benefits  there are two types of insurance benefits available through this policy death benefits and rider benefits we pay death benefits to the beneficiary named in the policy when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in force rider benefits offer special optional coverage in addition to the death benefit what are the insurance benefits under your policy there are two types of insurance benefits available through this policy death benefits and rider benefits we pay death benefits to the beneficiary named in the policy when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in force rider benefits offer special optional coverage in addition to the death benefit the rider benefits you choose will determine the additional amount if any thats paid to the beneficiary death benefits you have a choice of three death benefit options with this policy o under option  the death benefit is a fixed amount your policys face amount o under option  the death benefit is a variable amount based on your policys face amount and the value of the investments held in your policy your policy account value these values can change depending on the performance of the investments held in your policy o under option  the death benefit is an amount based on your policys face amount and the sum of your net accumulated premiums the death benefit amount will increase when you make premium payments but will decrease when you make partial withdrawals  s u m m a r y p r o s p e c t u s   paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th you may choose among these options with some restrictions until the policy anniversary the anniversary each year of the date your policy was issued closest to the insureds th birthday on or after this date the death benefit will be the policy account value within certain limits you can change your policys death benefit option on any policy anniversary after your policy has been in force for one year and as long as the insured is still living for more information see death benefit options additional sum insured you may purchase an additional sum insured when this policy is issued the additional sum insured will be part of your policys face amount this option may not be available in all jurisdictions see benefits and policy values rider benefits riders are a way to add to the coverage offered by your policy the riders offered under this policy are set forth in appendix b they are subject to giacs insurance and policy issuing requirements and all may not be available in all states the cost of any rider benefits you have added to your policy will be included in your monthly deduction which is withdrawn from your policy account value each month paying premiums  after you have paid the initial premium you may pay premiums on your policy at any time and in any amount during the lifetime of the insured what are premiums premiums are the payments you make to buy and keep your insurance in force there are several types of premiums associated with your park avenue vul which together form your policy premium see premiums after you have paid the initial premium you may pay premiums on your policy at any time and in any amount during the lifetime of the insured subject to certain limits however if the net cash surrender value of your policy is not sufficient to cover the monthly deduction from your policy your policy may lapse unless the no lapse guarantee is in effect and you have satisfied its requirements we will warn you if your policy is in danger of lapsing allocation options  you choose where your net premiums and policy account value are invested there are a number of variable investment options and a fixedrate option your premiums and policy account value may be allocated to a maximum of twenty allocation options at any one time what are your allocation options you choose where your net premiums and policy account value are invested there are a number of variable investment options and a fixedrate option these options are discussed under your allocation options your premiums and policy account value may be allocated to a maximum of twenty allocation options at any one time each variable investment option invests in a series of mutual funds the value of these options and your policy account value in them will vary depending on the performance of the mutual funds there is no minimum guaranteed policy account value for amounts allocated to the variable investment options and if you invest in variable investment options you will be subject to the risk that investment performance will be poor and that your policy account value will decrease you could lose everything you invest and your policy could lapse without value unless you pay additional premium you will find the investment objectives policies fees and expenses and a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each of these funds listed in the accompanying prospectus for that fund you should read the fund prospectuses   p r o s p e c t u s s u m m a r y  paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th carefully before investing in any variable investment option for a summary of this information see the variable investment options investment risks  investment performance in the variable investment options may be unfavorable you could lose everything you invest and your policy could lapse without value if you do not pay additional premium the rate of interest we declare for the fixedrate option may decrease to the minimum guaranteed rate amounts allocated to the fixedrate option earn a set rate of interest you earn interest on the total that you have invested in the fixedrate option including interest you have earned in previous years interest accrues daily at a minimum annual interest rate of  giac sets the rate of interest for the fixedrate option in its sole discretion and you assume the risk that the rates we set might not exceed the minimum guaranteed rate giac guarantees your principal and interest under this option can you transfer the money in your policy among different allocation options to the extent that the money in your policy is not being held as collateral against a loan you can transfer it among the variable investment options and into the fixedrate option at any time you may choose up to twenty allocation options at any time we limit transfers out of the fixedrate option see the fixedrate option loan risks  loans reduce the amount of policy account value available for withdrawal or surrender or the amount we pay on the insureds death by the amount of the indebtedness your policy may lapse if your indebtedness reduces the cash surrender value to zero a loan also may have tax consequences do you have access to the money youve invested in your policy after your policy has been in force for one year you may within limits make partial withdrawals of your policys net cash surrender value the net cash surrender value is your policy account value minus any surrender charges and policy debt you may also within limits borrow all or a portion of the loan value of your policy there are risks associated with policy loans when you take a policy loan we transfer the amount of the loan out of the variable investment options and the fixedrate option and hold that amount in the loan account to serve as collateral this loan collateral does not participate in the investment experience of those allocation options and the loan therefore can affect the policy value and death benefit over time whether or not the loan is repaid loans reduce the amount of your policy account value available for withdrawal or surrender or the amount we pay on the insureds death by the amount of any indebtedness your policy may lapse terminate without value if your indebtedness reduces the cash surrender value to zero if you surrender the policy or allow it to lapse while a policy loan is outstanding the amount of the loan to the extent it has not previously been taxed will be added to any amount you receive and taxed accordingly see policy loans and tax considerations for details surrender and withdrawal risks  the policy is designed to meet longterm financial goals surrenders and partial withdrawals may have tax consequences and the charges associated with surrenders may play a role in determining whether your policy will lapse finally you may at any time surrender your policy for the net cash surrender value after you surrender your policy you no longer have insurance coverage a surrender charge applies for  policy years after the issue date an additional surrender charge will be applicable for  years from the date of any increase in the face amount of the policy it is possible that you will receive no net cash surrender value if you surrender your policy in the first few policy years you should purchase the policy only if you have the financial ability to keep it in force for a substantial period of time you should not purchase the policy if you intend to surrender it or make partial withdrawals in the near future we designed the policy to meet longterm financial goals the policy is not suitable as a short term investment  s u m m a r y p r o s p e c t u s   paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th even if you do not ask to surrender your policy surrender charges and additional surrender charges may play a role in determining whether your policy will lapse terminate without value because surrender charges and additional surrender charges decrease the cash surrender value which is a measure we use to determine whether your policy will enter a grace period and possibly lapse surrenders and partial withdrawals may have tax consequences see surrendering your policy for details tax risks  while there is some uncertainty about the application of federal tax law to the policy we believe it is reasonable to conclude that increases in the value of your policy should not be taxed unless you make a withdrawal or in some cases take a loan or surrender your policy before the insured dies how is your policy affected by taxes we believe it is reasonable to conclude that your park avenue vul policy will be treated as a life insurance contract under federal tax law however due to limited guidance there is some uncertainty about the application of the federal tax law to the policy particularly with respect to policies issued on an insured who does not meet our insurance requirements for standard coverage assuming that your policy qualifies as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes you should not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the policy account value until there is a distribution from the policy moreover death benefits payable under a policy should be excludible from the gross income of the beneficiary as a result the beneficiary generally should not have to pay us federal income tax on the death benefit although some other taxes such as estate taxes may apply depending on the total amount of premiums you pay the policy may be treated as a modified endowment contract mec under federal tax laws if a policy is treated as a mec then surrenders partial withdrawals and loans under the policy will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in the policy in addition an additional  tax may be imposed on surrenders partial withdrawals and loans taken before you attain age  if the policy is not a mec distributions generally will be treated first as a return of basis or investment in the contract and then as taxable income moreover loans will generally not be treated as distributions finally neither distributions nor loans from a policy that is not a mec are subject to the  additional tax see tax considerations what deductions and charges do you have to pay there are various deductions and charges associated with maintaining your park avenue vul policy these charges are set forth in the charges and deductions tables and in the section titled

intended that the investment divisions of the separate account through the mutual funds will satisfy these diversification requirements this discussion of tax considerations for your park avenue vul policy is general in nature does not purport to be complete or to cover all tax situations and should not be considered as tax advice it is based on our understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently being interpreted we cannot guarantee that these laws will not change while this prospectus is in use or while your policy is in force if you are interested in purchasing a policy taking a policy loan or effecting policy transactions you should consult a legal or tax adviser regarding your particular circumstances  tax status of the policy in order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a life insurance policy must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in section  of the internal revenue code guidance as to how these requirements are to be applied is limited accordingly there is some uncertainty about the application of section  to a policy particularly so with respect to policies issued on an insured who does not meet our insurance requirements for standard coverage nevertheless we believe there is a reasonable basis for concluding that your policy should satisfy the applicable requirements if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy the applicable requirements we may take appropriate steps to bring the policy into compliance with such requirements and we reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary in order to do so in certain circumstances owners of variable life insurance policies have been considered for federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the separate account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise investment control over those assets where this is the case the policyowners have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to separate account assets there is little guidance in this area and some features of the park avenue vul policy such as your flexibility to allocate premiums and the policy account value have not been explicitly addressed in published rulings while we believe that the policy does not give policyowners investment control over the separate accounts assets we reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary to prevent the policyowner from being treated as the owner of the separate account assets supporting the policy in addition the code requires that the investments of the investment divisions of our separate account be adequately diversified in order for the policy to be treated as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes it is intended that the investment divisions of the separate account through the mutual funds will satisfy these diversification

believe that the death benefits under your policy generally should be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary generally under the existing federal tax laws increases in the value of your policy will not be taxed federally unless you make a withdrawal before the insured dies the money that you receive when the insured dies is not subject to federal income tax but may be subject to federal estate taxes or generation skipping taxes the tax consequences of continuing a policy beyond the insureds th year are unclear you should consult a tax advisor if you intend to keep the policy in force beyond the insureds th year partial withdrawals surrenders and policy loans all result in money being taken out of your policy before the insured dies how this money is taxed depends on whether your policy is classified as a modified endowment contract under the internal revenue code certain life insurance contracts are classified as modified endowment contracts with less favorable tax treatment than other life insurance contracts due to the flexibility of the policy as to premiums and benefits the individual circumstances of each policy will determine whether it is classified as a modified endowment contract the rules are too complex to be summarized here but generally depend on the amount of premium payments made during the first seven policy years certain changes in a policy after it is issued could also cause it to be classified as a modified endowment contract you should consult with a competent tax adviser to determine whether a policy transaction will cause your policy to be classified as a modified endowment contract if your policy is not considered a modified endowment contract o money that you withdraw from your policy will generally be taxed only if the total that you withdraw exceeds your basis in the policy  which is generally equal to the total amount that you have paid in premiums however certain distributions that must be made to enable the policy to continue to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes if policy benefits are reduced during the first  policy years may be treated in whole or in part as ordinary income subject to tax the difference between what you have put in and what you take out will be taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw money from your policy your basis is reduced by any amount withdrawn that is not taxed o if you surrender your policy you will generally be taxed only on the amount by which the value of your policy including any policy debt is greater than your basis in the policy the tax consequences of surrendering your policy may vary if you receive the proceeds under one of the payment plans losses are generally not tax deductible o policy loans are generally not taxable because they must be paid back the interest you pay on these loans is generally not tax deductible however if your policy lapses while you have an outstanding policy loan you may have to pay tax on the amount that you still owe to your policy the tax consequences of a policy loan are unclear if the  t a x c o n s i d e r a t i o n s p r o s p e c t u s

contract has been distributed o all modified endowment contracts issued to you by giac or its affiliates during any calendar year will be treated as one modified endowment contract to determine the taxable portion of any distribution o a  penalty tax will also apply to any taxable distribution unless it is made to a taxpayer who is  years of age or older is attributable to a disability or is received as substantially equal periodic payments made over the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or the life or life expectancies of the taxpayer and a designated beneficiary if a policy becomes a modified endowment contract distributions that occur during the contract year will be taxed as distributions from a modified endowment contract in addition distributions from a policy within two years before it becomes a modified endowment contract will be taxed in this manner this means that a distribution made from a policy that is not a modified endowment contract could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified endowment contract exchanges generally there are no tax consequences when you exchange one life insurance policy for another as long as the same person is being insured a change of the insured under a policy is a taxable event paying additional premiums under the new policy may cause it to be treated as a modified endowment contract your policy may also

day minus any federal state or local taxes payable by giac and allocated by giac to the variable investment option divided by o the net asset value of one share of the same mutual fund at the close of

determine how your policy is affected by a reduction in the face amount due to a partial withdrawal o under option  a partial withdrawal will typically cause an immediate reduction in your policys face amount o under option  a partial withdrawal will not reduce your policys face amount however the amount of your death benefit will decline with each partial withdrawal o under option  a partial withdrawal will typically not cause an immediate reduction in your policys face amount however the amount of your death benefit will decline with each partial withdrawal if you have made one or more increases to the initial face amount by adding policy segments and then request a face amount decrease we will apply the decrease to your policy segments as follows we start with the most recent policy segment followed by the next most recent and so on and then reduce the additional sum insured portion of the initial face amount and finally reduce the basic sum insured portion of the initial face amount since we do not deduct a surrender charge when you decrease the face amount the surrender charge does not change your policy account value must always be greater than the surrender charge further the administrative charge per  of coverage is not reduced by a decrease in face amount we will send you policy pages that reflect the changes resulting from your reduction in the face amount reducing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences including possibly causing it to be considered a modified endowment contract under the internal revenue code a decrease in face amount may also reduce the federal tax law limits on what you can put into the policy in these cases you may need to have a portion of the policys cash value paid to you to comply with federal tax law see tax considerations you can also reduce or cancel coverage provided by the adjustable annual renewable term rider areduction in the face amount of the adjustable annual renewable term rider will not affect the face amount of your policy likewise you can decrease the face amount of your policy without reducing the coverage of your term rider consult your sales representative for advice increasing

amount of your policy it will be subject to new surrender charges well calculate the surrender charges as if you had bought a new policy for the increase in the face amount a new year surrender charge will apply to the policy segment that increased the face amount well notify you about the new surrender charge after any increase in the face amount you dont have to pay an additional premium to increase the face amount however you may have to make a premium payment to prevent the policy from going into default thats because the new surrender charges triggered by an increase in the face

assume he pays  per year for  years and  per year for the next  years the premiums and premium charges are allocated as follows years  all premiums are allocated to the initial face amount because

increase he is classified in the standard underwriting class for the purposes of calculating the applicable surrender charges each face amount increase is treated separately based on the insureds attained age and underwriting class at the time of the increase therefore for each increase the policy will incur a new set of surrender charges surrender charges are calculated as if the policyowner has purchased a policy with the amount of the increase being the face amount in other words they are calculated just as in the first example the total surrender charge for a particular policy year

the net amount at risk partly depends on the death benefit option you choose if you choose option  in which the death benefit is the face amount of your policy you reduce the net amount at risk when you pay premiums thats because premiums increase the policy account value if you choose option  in which the death benefit can increase to more than the face amount paying premiums will not affect the net amount at risk if you choose option  in which the death benefit is the face amount of your policy plus your net accumulated premiums your net amount at risk could be lower if your investments perform well the net amount at risk can increase for example when we increase a policys death benefit to meet the requirements of the internal revenue code see death benefit options having a higher net amount at risk results in higher deductions for cost of insurance there may be different cost of insurance rates for the initial face amount of your policy and for each subsequent increase in the face amount as a result we calculate the net amount at risk separately for each segment of coverage your policy account value is allocated first to your policys basic sum insured then to the additional sum insured and finally to each of the policy segments in the order that they were added to the policy the maximum amount of your policy account value that will be allocated to any one policy segment or to the initial face amount is the amount that the policy segment or initial face amount provides as a death benefit divided by  for the purposes of determining the net amount at risk if the death benefit is increased due to the operation of death benefit option  or  the increase will be allocated to the basic sum insured if the death benefit is further increased due to section  of the internal revenue code the increase will be allocated to the most recent policy segment performance information average annual total return information for the mutual funds is set forth in appendix

entails certain risks particularly if the policys cash surrender value as opposed to its death benefit will be the principal policy feature used for such planning purposes if policy premiums are not paid the investment performance of the variable investment options to which policy account value is allocated is poorer than anticipated or insufficient cash surrender value is maintained then the policy may lapse or may not accumulate sufficient values to fund the purpose for which the policy was purchased because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a longterm basis before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose a purchaser should consider whether the longterm nature of the policy is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered policyowners are urged to consult competent tax advisors about the possible tax consequences of predeath distributions from any life insurance policy including park avenue life the following are examples of ways in which the

mortgage protection life insurance may be purchased on the life of the persons responsible for making mortgage payments the amount of insurance purchased should equal the mortgage amount in the event of the insureds death the guaranteed death benefit can be used to offset the remaining mortgage balance during the insureds lifetime the cash value accumulations may be accessed late in the mortgage
