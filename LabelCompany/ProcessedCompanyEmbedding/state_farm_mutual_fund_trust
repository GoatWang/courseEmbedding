that is established during the estate owners lifetime this type of trust allows the grantor control over the trust assets and the ability to change or terminate the trust at any time because of this its use will not keep the trust assets out of the gross estate and therefore will not reduce federal estate tax however provisions can be included in the trust to minimize federal estate tax such as utilizing the applicable credit amount at the grantors death perhaps the most common reason to establish a revocable living trust is to avoid the expense and delay of probate these costs vary greatly and may not be substantial but it may be important to the estate owner to reduce or eliminate them however before a revocable trust is established the estate owner should consider costs such as the attorneys fees for drafting the trust and any possible trustee fees for managing the trust another reason to establish a revocable living trust is asset management the estate owner may become disabled or doesnt want to bother with the worry of managing the assets in addition after the estate owners death the trust beneficiaries may not have the expertise to manage the assets of the estate in both of these cases the professional trustee can manage the trust assets typically a revocable trust includes provisions that distribute trust income to the grantor during lifetime make use of the applicable credit amount at the death of the first spouse and ultimately pass trust property to the children or other estate beneficiaries according to the grantors objectives related links estate

management company or sponsor that organizes the fund provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund the fund manager may also provide other administrative services the management fee often has breakpoints which means that it declines as assets in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole increase the funds board reviews the management fee annually fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fee in order to lower the funds expense ratio index funds generally charge a lower management fee than activelymanaged funds distribution chargesedit main article mutual fund fees and expenses distribution charges pay for marketing distribution of the funds shares as well as services to investors there are three types of distribution charges frontend load or sales charge a frontend load or sales charge is a commission paid to a broker by a mutual fund when shares are purchased it is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the public offering price which equals the net asset value plus the frontend load per share the frontend load often declines as the amount invested increases through breakpoints the frontend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the amount invested backend load some funds have a backend load which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed if the backend load declines the longer the investor holds shares it is called a contingent deferred sales charges cdsc like the frontend load the backend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the redemption proceeds distribution and services fee some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders in the united states this fee is sometimes called a b fee after the sec rule authorizing it the distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value distribution charges generally vary for each share class securities transaction fees incurred by the fundedit a mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio these expenses may include brokerage commissions these costs are normally positively correlated with turnover shareholder transaction feesedit shareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions such as buying or selling shares of the fund for example a fund may charge a flat fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor some funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them usually defined as within   or  days of purchase redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio fund services chargesedit a mutual fund may pay for other services including board of directors or trustees fees and expenses

ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets the management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio frontend and backend loads securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded to facilitate comparisons of expenses regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results noload fundedit in the united states a fund that calls itself noload cannot charge a frontend load or backend load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than  of fund assets controversy regarding fees and expensesedit critics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high they believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay they argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios fund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and therefore reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided they also note that fees are clearly disclosed definitions of key termsedit average annual total returnedit mutual

in securities and currencies the characterization of a funds income is unchanged when it is paid to shareholders for example when a mutual fund distributes dividend income to its shareholders fund investors will report the distribution as dividend income on their tax return as a result mutual funds are often called passthrough vehicles because they simply pass on income and related tax liabilities to their investors the investment company act of  establishes rules specifically governing mutual funds the investment advisers act of  establishes rules governing the investment advisers

their principal investments as described in the prospectus and investment objective the four main categories of funds are money market funds bond or fixed income funds stock or equity funds and hybrid funds within these categories funds may be subclassified by investment objective investment approach or specific focus the types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the funds prospectus a legal document which describes the funds investment objective investment approach and permitted investments the investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks for example a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds rather than from dividend or interest income the investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund bond stock and hybrid funds may be classified as either index or passivelymanaged funds or actively managed funds money market fundsedit main article money market fund money market funds invest in money market instruments which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank savings accounts though money market funds are not insured by the government unlike bank savings accounts in the united

funds managed by the same fund sponsor although some invest in unaffiliated funds ie managed by other fund sponsors or some combination of the two in the united states at the end of  assets in hybrid funds were  trillion representing  of the industry other fundsedit funds may invest in commodities or other investments expensesedit investors in a mutual fund pay the funds expenses some of these expenses reduce the value of an investors account others are paid by the fund and reduce net asset value these expenses fall into five categories management feeedit main article management fee the management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund the fund manager may also provide other administrative services the management fee often has breakpoints which means that it declines as assets in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole increase the funds board reviews the management fee annually fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the

expenses distribution charges pay for marketing distribution of the funds shares as well as services to investors there are three types of distribution charges frontend load or sales charge a frontend load or sales charge is a commission paid to a broker by a mutual fund when shares are purchased it is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the public offering price which equals the net asset value plus the frontend load per share the frontend load often declines as the amount invested increases through breakpoints the frontend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the amount invested backend load some funds have a backend load which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed if the backend load declines the longer the investor holds shares it is called a contingent deferred sales charges cdsc like the frontend load the backend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the redemption proceeds distribution and services fee some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders in the united states this fee is sometimes called a b fee after the sec rule authorizing it the distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value distribution charges generally vary for each share class securities transaction fees incurred by the fundedit a mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio these expenses may include brokerage commissions these costs are normally positively correlated with turnover shareholder transaction feesedit shareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions such as buying or selling shares of the fund for example a fund may charge a flat fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor some funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them usually defined as within   or  days of purchase redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio fund services chargesedit a mutual fund may pay for other services

fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio frontend and backend loads securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded to facilitate comparisons of expenses regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results noload fundedit in the united states a fund that calls itself noload cannot charge a frontend load or backend load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than  of fund assets controversy regarding fees and expensesedit critics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high they believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay they argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios fund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and therefore reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided they also note that fees are clearly disclosed definitions of key termsedit average annual total returnedit mutual funds in the united states are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one fiveand ten yearperiods

shares outstanding funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses most compute their nav at the end of each business day valuing the securities held in a funds portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value the funds board typically oversees security valuation share classesedit a single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of frontend loads backend loads and distribution and services fee by offering several different types of shares known as share classes all of them invest in the same portfolio of securities but each has different expenses and therefore a different net asset value and different performance results some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors typical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the united sates are class a shares usually charge a frontend sales load together with a small distribution and services fee class b shares usually do not have a frontend sales load rather they have a high contingent deferred sales charge cdsc that gradually declines over several years combined with a high

the four main categories of funds are money market funds bond or fixed income funds stock or equity funds and hybrid funds within these categories funds may be subclassified by investment objective investment approach or specific focus the types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the funds prospectus a legal document which describes the funds investment objective investment approach and permitted investments the investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks for example a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds rather than from dividend or interest income the investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund bond stock and hybrid funds may be classified as either index or passivelymanaged funds or actively managed funds money market fundsedit main article money market fund money

although some invest in unaffiliated funds ie managed by other fund sponsors or some combination of the two in the united states at the end of  assets in hybrid funds were  trillion representing  of the industry other fundsedit funds may invest in commodities or other investments expensesedit investors in a mutual fund pay the funds expenses some of these expenses reduce the value of an investors account others are paid by the fund and reduce net asset value these expenses fall into five categories management feeedit main article management fee the management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund the fund manager may also provide other administrative services the management fee often has breakpoints which means that it declines as assets in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole increase the funds board reviews the management fee annually fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fee in order to lower the funds expense ratio index funds generally charge a lower management fee than activelymanaged funds distribution chargesedit main article mutual fund fees and expenses distribution charges pay for marketing distribution of the funds shares as well as services to investors there are three types of distribution charges frontend load or sales charge a frontend load or sales charge is a commission paid to a broker by a mutual fund when shares are purchased it is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the public offering price which equals the net asset value plus the frontend load per share the frontend load often declines as the amount invested increases through breakpoints the frontend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the amount invested backend load some funds have a backend load which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed if the backend load declines the longer the investor holds shares it is called a contingent deferred sales charges cdsc like the frontend load the backend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the redemption proceeds distribution and services fee some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders in the united states this fee is sometimes called a b fee after the sec rule authorizing it the distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value distribution charges generally vary for each share class securities transaction fees incurred by the fundedit a mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio these expenses may include brokerage commissions these costs are normally positively correlated with turnover shareholder transaction feesedit shareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions such as buying or selling shares of the fund for example a fund may charge a flat fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor some funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them usually defined as within   or  days of purchase redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio fund services chargesedit a mutual fund may pay for other services including board of directors or trustees fees and expenses custody fee paid to a custodian bank for holding the funds portfolio in safekeeping and collecting income owed on the securities fund administration fee for overseeing all administrative affairs such as preparing financial statements and shareholder reports sec filings monitoring compliance computing total returns and other performance information preparingfiling tax returns and all expenses of

documents to shareholders such as shareholder reports and prospectuses transfer agent service fees and expenses for keeping shareholder records providing statements and tax forms to investors and providing telephone internet and or other investor support and servicing othermiscellaneous fees the fund manager or sponsor may agree to subsidize some of these charges expense ratioedit the expense ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets the management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio frontend and backend loads securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded to facilitate comparisons of expenses regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results noload fundedit in the united states a fund that calls itself noload cannot charge a frontend load or backend load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than  of fund assets controversy regarding fees and expensesedit critics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high they believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay they argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios fund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and therefore reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided they also note that fees are clearly disclosed definitions of key termsedit average annual total returnedit mutual funds in the united states are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one fiveand ten yearperiods using the following formula ptn  erv where p  a hypothetical initial

also be referred to as the funds net assets it is usually expressed as a pershare amount computed by dividing net assets by the number of fund shares outstanding funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses most compute their nav at the end of each business day valuing the securities held in a funds portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value the funds board typically oversees security valuation share classesedit a single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of frontend loads backend loads and distribution and services fee by offering several different types of shares known as share classes all of them invest in the same portfolio of securities but each has different expenses and therefore a different net asset value and different performance results some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors typical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the united sates are class a shares usually charge a frontend sales load together with a small distribution and services fee class b shares usually do not have a frontend sales load rather they have a high contingent deferred sales charge cdsc that gradually declines over several years combined with a high b fee class b shares usually convert automatically to class a shares after they have been held for a certain period class c shares usually have a high distribution and services fee and a modest contingent deferred sales charge that is discontinued after one or two years class c shares usually do not convert to another class they are often called level load shares class i are usually subject to very high minimum investment requirements and are therefore known as institutional shares they are noload shares class r are usually for use in retirement plans such as k plans they typically do not charge loads but do charge a small distribution and

in securities and currencies the characterization of a funds income is unchanged when it is paid to shareholders for example when a mutual fund distributes dividend income to its shareholders fund

etfs in the united states with combined assets of  trillion accounting for  of the us industry classification of funds by types of underlying investmentsedit mutual funds are normally classified by their principal investments as described in the prospectus and investment objective the four main categories of funds are money market funds bond or fixed income funds stock or equity funds and hybrid funds within these categories funds may be subclassified by investment objective investment approach or specific focus the types of securities that a particular fund may invest in are set forth in the funds prospectus a legal document which describes the funds investment objective investment approach and permitted investments the investment objective describes the type of income that the fund seeks for example a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds rather than from dividend or interest income the investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund bond stock and hybrid funds may be classified as either index or passivelymanaged funds or actively managed funds money market fundsedit main article money market fund money market funds invest in money market instruments which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank savings accounts though money market funds are not insured by the government unlike bank savings accounts in the united states money market funds sold to retail investors and those investing in government securities may maintain a stable net asset value of  per share when they comply with certain conditions other money market funds must compute a net asset value based on the value of the securities held in the funds in the united states at the end of  assets in money market funds were  trillion representing  of the

funds managed by the same fund sponsor although some invest in unaffiliated funds ie managed by other fund sponsors or some combination of the two in the united states at the end of  assets in hybrid funds were  trillion representing  of the industry other fundsedit funds may invest in commodities or other investments expensesedit investors in a mutual fund pay the funds expenses some of these expenses reduce the value of an investors account others are paid by the fund and reduce net asset value these expenses fall into five categories management feeedit main article management fee the management fee is paid by the fund to the management company or sponsor that organizes the fund provides the portfolio management or investment advisory services and normally lends its brand to the fund the fund manager may also provide other administrative services the management fee often has breakpoints which means that it declines as assets in either the specific fund or in the fund family as a whole increase the funds board reviews the management fee annually fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase but the fund manager or sponsor can agree to waive some or all of the management fee in order to lower the funds expense ratio index funds generally charge a lower management fee than activelymanaged funds distribution chargesedit main article mutual fund fees and expenses distribution charges pay for marketing distribution of the funds shares as well as services to investors there are three types of distribution charges frontend load or sales charge a frontend load or sales charge is a commission paid to a broker by a mutual fund when shares are purchased it is expressed as a percentage of the total amount invested or the public offering price which equals the net asset value plus the frontend load per share the frontend load often declines as the amount invested increases through breakpoints the frontend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the amount invested backend load some funds have a backend load which is paid by the investor when shares are redeemed if the backend load declines the longer the investor holds shares it is called a contingent deferred sales charges cdsc like the frontend load the backend load is paid by the investor it is deducted from the redemption proceeds distribution and services fee some funds charge an annual fee to compensate the distributor of fund shares for providing ongoing services to fund shareholders in the united states this fee is sometimes called a b fee after the sec rule authorizing it the distribution and services fee is paid by the fund and reduces net asset value distribution charges generally vary for each share class securities transaction fees incurred by the fundedit a mutual fund pays expenses related to buying or selling the securities in its portfolio these expenses may include brokerage commissions these costs are normally positively correlated with turnover shareholder transaction feesedit shareholders may be required to pay fees for certain transactions such as buying or selling shares of the fund for example a fund may charge a flat fee for maintaining an individual retirement account for an investor some funds charge redemption fees when an investor sells fund shares shortly after buying them usually defined as within   or  days of purchase redemption fees are computed as a percentage of the sale amount shareholder transaction fees are not part of the expense ratio fund services chargesedit a mutual fund may pay for other services including board of directors or trustees fees and expenses custody fee paid to a custodian bank for holding the funds portfolio in safekeeping and collecting income owed on the securities fund administration fee for overseeing all administrative affairs such as preparing financial statements and shareholder reports sec filings monitoring compliance computing total returns and other performance information preparingfiling tax returns and all expenses of maintaining compliance with state blue sky laws fund accounting fee for performing investment or securities accounting services

regulators shareholder communications expenses printing and mailing required documents to shareholders such as shareholder reports and prospectuses transfer agent service fees and expenses for keeping shareholder records providing statements and tax forms to investors and providing telephone internet and or other investor support and servicing othermiscellaneous fees the fund manager or sponsor may agree to subsidize some of these charges expense ratioedit the expense ratio equals recurring fees and expenses charged to the fund during the year divided by average net assets the management fee and fund services charges are ordinarily included in the expense ratio frontend and backend loads securities transaction fees and shareholder transaction fees are normally excluded to facilitate comparisons of expenses regulators generally require that funds use the same formula to compute the expense ratio and publish the results noload fundedit in the united states a fund that calls itself noload cannot charge a frontend load or backend load under any circumstances and cannot charge a distribution and services fee greater than  of fund assets controversy regarding fees and expensesedit critics of the fund industry argue that fund expenses are too high they believe that the market for mutual funds is not competitive and that there are many hidden fees so that it is difficult for investors to reduce the fees that they pay they argue that the most effective way for investors to raise the returns they earn from mutual funds is to invest in funds with low expense ratios fund managers counter that fees are determined by a highly competitive market and therefore reflect the value that investors attribute to the service provided they also note that fees are clearly disclosed definitions of key termsedit average annual total returnedit mutual funds in the united states are required to report the average annual compounded rates of return for one fiveand ten yearperiods using the following formula ptn  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the

holdings minus the funds liabilities this figure may also be referred to as the funds net assets it is usually expressed as a pershare amount computed by dividing net assets by the number of fund shares outstanding funds must compute their net asset value according to the rules set forth in their prospectuses most compute their nav at the end of each business day valuing the securities held in a funds portfolio is often the most difficult part of calculating net asset value the funds board typically oversees security valuation share classesedit a single mutual fund may give investors a choice of different combinations of frontend loads backend loads and distribution and services fee by offering several different types of shares known as share classes all of them invest in the same portfolio of securities but each has different expenses and therefore a different net asset value and different performance results some of these share classes may be available only to certain types of investors typical share classes for funds sold through brokers or other intermediaries in the united sates are class a shares usually charge a frontend sales load together with a small distribution and services fee class b shares usually do not have a frontend sales load rather they have a high contingent deferred sales charge cdsc that gradually declines over several years combined with a high b fee class b shares usually convert automatically to class a shares after they have been held for a certain period class c shares usually have a high distribution and services fee and a modest contingent deferred sales charge that is discontinued after one or two years class c shares usually do not convert to another class they are often called level load shares class i are usually subject to very high minimum investment requirements and are therefore known as institutional shares they are noload shares class r are usually for use in retirement plans such as k plans they typically do not charge loads but do charge a small distribution and services fee noload funds in the united states often have two classes of shares class i shares do not charge a distribution and services fee

to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
