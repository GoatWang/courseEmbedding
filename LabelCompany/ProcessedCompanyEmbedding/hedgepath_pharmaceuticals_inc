hedgepath pharmaceuticals to receive  million in funding from mayne pharma hedgepath pharmaceuticals to receive  million in funding from mayne pharma hedgepath to shortly commence phase iib skin cancer trial using mayne pharmas suba™itraconazole may    et from hedgepath pharmaceuticals inc tampa fla and san diego may   prnewswire  hedgepath pharmaceuticals inc otcqb hppi a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers develops and plans to commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with cancer announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of mayne pharma group limited asx myx under which mayne pharma will invest  million in hppi in a private common stock and warrant financing  the closing of the financing is expected to occur within five business days  hppi will use this funding to immediately accelerate its development program which is focused on the treatment of certain cancers using mayne pharmas patented oral formulation of the currently approval antifungal drug itraconazole known as subaitraconazole for which hppi has exclusive us rights in the field of cancer  in particular hppi will shortly be commencing a phase iib clinical trial designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of subaitraconazole dosing on the reduction in individual patient tumor burden in patients with basal cell carcinoma nevus syndrome also known as gorlin syndrome  preliminary results are expected to be available by early  mayne pharmas ceo mr scott richards said we are excited about increasing our stake in hppi and accelerating the development and commercialization of our patented subaitraconazole for the treatment of cancer  the body of evidence supporting the use of itraconazole in cancer is well established and we believe our subaitraconazole product provides a number of advantages over conventional itraconazole including improved bioavailability and more consistent blood levels to improve the therapeutic effect   nicholas j virca hppis president and ceo further commented that this investment by mayne pharma enables us to immediately begin efforts to open clinical trial sites during this quarter for our phase iib study following the protocols which were cleared by fda in december     bccns results from a genetic mutation which causes the hedgehog pathway to function improperly leading to the chronic formation of basal cell tumors industry sources estimate that there are approximately  patients in the united states with bccns which could potentially qualify for subaitraconazole under the fdas orphan drug designation program for treatment of bccns in this patient population our phase iib design is a singlearm multicenter openlabel nonplacebo controlled study which will involve the recruiting of up to  patients where a meaningful response will be defined as a  or greater reduction in the cumulative size of target tumors based upon the clinical evaluation of at least  of  patients we plan to report preliminary results by early  after assessing the effectiveness and safety of  weeks of dosing in these patients commented mr virca  he continued that if the results demonstrate we have achieved our primary endpoint we will initiate further discussions with fda to determine if our trial could potentially serve as the basis for accelerated approval and submission of a new drug application in the financing for its  million investment mayne pharma will receive  shares of hppi common stock bringing its position in hppi to  of the currently outstanding common stock and a year warrant to purchase an additional  shares of hppi common stock  hppi mayne pharma and certain related parties have also entered into updated agreements covering hppi and mayne
