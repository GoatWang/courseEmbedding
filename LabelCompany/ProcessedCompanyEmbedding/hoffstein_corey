abstract a significant amount of time at newfound is appropriated to quantitative strategy construction implicit in mandating quantitative integrity is developing intuition around investment strategy behaviors throughout the construction process during one of our strategy deepdives we discovered a phenomenon that seemed contrary to our initial intuition specifically we assumed that implementing an investment strategy over different time intervals ie daily weekly monthly etc over the same time horizon would lead to uncorrelated returns however we discovered that no matter the interval the correlation never fell below a certain minimum threshold we then discovered the same behavior when exploring the jointbehavior of different investment strategies that utilize the same underlying assetsin this paper we mathematically prove the existence of this correlation boundary specifically we prove that any portfolio will have a correlation to its underlying assets greater than or equal to the minimum pairwise correlation between the assets we call this minimum correlation level the correlation boundary after proving this boundary we extend the proof in multiple ways eventually leading to our ultimate implication any two investment or trading strategies will always have a correlation to each other that equals or exceeds the minimum pairwise correlation of the set made from the union of their individual underlying assets no matter the investment horizon of the two strategies keywords correlation correlation boundary jointdependence jel classification g suggested citation
