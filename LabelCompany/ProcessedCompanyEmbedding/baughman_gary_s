you must be signed in to print once signed in look for the pdf button byu magazine gary baughman turning companies around winter  issue by ryan christensen though he spent  years leading some of the united states’ largest toy companies byu alumnus gary s baughman  says toys aren’t the focus of his career “i really don’t see myself as a toy person” says the man who headed little tykes then tyco toys and finally fisherprice inc before his retirement in april  “i see myself more as a general manager with a great deal of experience in turning businesses around” baughman loves the challenge of helping a struggling business “that has become my passiontaking a business that’s struggling studying the marketplace the organization the products the systems and then creating a business plan that leads the company back to profitable growth to me that’s the most exciting challenge in business turning a company around is not only good for the company of course but it’s tremendously satisfying personally because you save people’s jobs and thereby change lives for the better” when he graduated from byu in  with an economics degree however baughman had no idea what he wanted to do after earning an mba from the university of michigan he spent a year helping his father run a small business in salt lake city then spent seven years in new york city before moving to chicago where he became president of the stiffel lamp company it was at stiffel that he had his first opportunity to manage a struggling business turning companies around has been his first love in business ever since baughman’s first experience in the toy industry was as president of little tikes where he led the company to a dramatic increase in sales and earnings he then became ceo of tyco toys where he made several successful changes that included the introduction of the popular tickle me elmo product line when tyco was acquired by mattel baughman became ceo of fisherprice before retiring baughman guided the company’s us operating business back to profitability in addition to turnarounds baughman loves new product development “i started my career in product development and i have never lost my love of seeing new products come to market” he says even in toys product development is a very scientific process but for him there is something almost magical about it “in the toy business the products that ultimately win are those that somehow capture the imagination of children or their parents” he says throughout his career baughman made sure not to neglect his family he and his wife marilyn ’ have four sons two of whom are now students at byu “i made a decision a long time ago that i was going to enjoy my family and not shortchange them” he says it hasn’t been easy three of his terms as company president have coincided with demanding church leadership callingshe has twice been an lds bishop and is still a stake president that combination of responsibilities gave him he says “lots of learning experiences” about his success in the business world baughman admits “some of it seemed like pure luck at the time however i believe that we are guided by the lord to the right opportunities” in his speech at the marriott school of management’s april  convocation baughman outlined five attributes he considers essential in business working successfully with other people communicating well becoming excellent at your job taking wellthoughtout risks andmost of allbeing passionate about what you do “if you can find a career you’re passionate about you’re going to work harder put in the hours and do the things you need to do to be successful” he says “and if you love what you do” he adds “it’s infectious and people will want to follow you” more from this issue browse the complete
