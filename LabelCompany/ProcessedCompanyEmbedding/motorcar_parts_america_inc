potential to cut material and energy consumption by up to  remanufacturing is the most efficient and sustainable process for producing aftermarket replacement parts making mpa’s business practices green by nature mpa’s longstanding commitment to sustainability dates back to our founding in  environmentally sustainable processes were at the core of our business practices then just as they are now not only does mpa’s comprehensive cleantech remanufacturing process produce starters alternators and other components that deliver superior performance and reliability it also makes a significant positive impact in terms of sustainability mpa’s ecofriendly manufacturing model relies on reusing and reconditioning previously used core units that would otherwise end up recycled or disposed by reconditioning and reemploying durable components — such as housings magnets and stators — mpa generates a positive impact on the environment remanufacturing preserves the energy invested in forging and forming durable components an advantage to recycling alone through reclaiming and reconditioning these components mpa also conserves the energy and materials that would be required to create new parts — while delivering units that provide the same level of dependable performance how remanufacturing can counter climate change remanufacturing is a process based on refurbishing and reusing previously manufactured parts rather than producing new ones the remanufacturing process conserves the energy embodied in a product and compared to traditional manufacturing requires minimal additional energy manufacturing one new starter for instance demands more than  times the amount of energy and nine times the amount of materials required producing a remanufactured one a new alternator meanwhile requires approximately seven times the amount of energy and eight times the amount of raw material required to produce a remanufactured one it’s been estimated that remanufacturing a starter or alternator saves up to  of the energy that would otherwise be expended in producing a new part that energy savings translates into lower carbon dioxide output and overall lower consumption in fact by some estimates remanufactured products conserve roughly the equivalent of  trillion btus of energy per year the remanufacturing process employed by mpa takes real steps to mitigate the effects of climate change by drastically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are normally generated by producing new parts investor relations  motorcar parts of america inc skip to

bright future in the aftermarketnevertheless there is a potential risk of an    drop in the value of the company’s shares according to our calculationsmotorcar parts of america incs nasdaqmpaa revenue has been showing a doubledigit growth over the last four financial years the market conditions are beneficial for the next expansion period even so our valuation model has not identified undervaluation in the stock prompting us to issue a buy recommendation source companys financials authors dcf model there are few products in the companys portfolio so the management has been expanding the product line almost every year source aasa  aftermarket overview a proven ability to launch new product lines is a main catalyst for consistent growth this is especially handy given the anticipation of a fast growth in the us difm market segment source aasa  aftermarket overview mpas management will look for new ideas in the following product lines with large market opportunities source mpa investor presentation the current mpas product portfolio is targeting the old vehicle owners because auto parts like alternators starters and brake master cylinders are generally only replaced later in a vehicles life if the management keeps its development strategy the next step is likely the opening or acquisition of the brake calipers and pads production facility the company with this product portfolio will benefit if  there are more cars on the roads  the annual miles driven by these cars will show a positive dynamic  the average age of the vehicle continues to grow the statistical data presented below shows that all of these factors are favorable for the companys expansion  the number of us light vehicle population millions source gabelli  company report  according to kpmg the annual miles driven will increase by one trillion more milesyear by  currently at three trillion with an upside scenario of an additional  trillion milesyear  trillion milesyear source aasa  aftermarket overview  the market analysts believe that the average age of the vehicle will continue to climb and will reach a level of  years in  source gabelli  company report it is obvious that these market conditions should lead to the aftermarkets growth let us now see how these forecasts affect the companys valuation for our valuation model we used the following growth assumptions  revenue cagr is set at its historical level   fy   ebit forecast for the period fy  fy is based on the average historical operating profitability   of sales method  we believe that the ebits profitability for fy  will be around  for the historical nine months ended december   ebit equals  of revenues  da and capex are tied to the revenue growth we apply the recent percentage of sales to the model  fy figures are calculated taking into account the historical numbers as you can see our projections are quite optimistic the use of the expected fy ebit profitability level for the period fy  fy is a stretch keep in mind that the average operating margin of the companys main competitors including american axle  manufacturing holdings inc nyseaxl lear corp nyselea tenneco inc nyseten dana inc nysedan borgwarner inc nysebwa autoliv inc nysealv delphi automotive plc nysedlph lkq corp nasdaqlkq is around  source wsjcom you can see the dynamics of the forecasted revenues and ebitda figures in the chart presented below source authors dcf model our dcf model shows that after the implementation of the optimistic assumptions the target range per share is     under the ebitda multiple method     under the gordon growth method despite the wide margin it is lower than the current market price of the stock in both cases  per share as of the time of writing this means that there is a considerable downside risk for the stock source authors dcf model conclusion it seems that motorcar parts of america inc is in a good environment given the growth projections for the market it serves in addition it has been showing aboveaverage profitability and capabilities to expand its product line despite that our fundamental analysis based on the results of the comprehensive dcf model shows that mpa is overvalued at current market prices we recommend staying away from the stock as the potential upside does not justify the risk and the current price likely reflects the most optimistic scenario our target price range is    per share which is    lower than the market price of the stock societe financiers is an investment research team focused on longterm long and shortonly

eventdriven hedge fund analystsummarymotorcar parts of america has unconventional accounting practices that conceal its true assets and roicnegative operating cash flows year after year are concerning and not characteristic of a lowgrowth companywe believe motorcar parts of americas true share price should be around  a hefty discount to its current share pricecompany description motorcar parts of america inc nasdaqmpaa and its subsidiaries the company or mpa is a leading manufacturer remanufacturer and distributor of aftermarket automotive parts these replacement parts are sold for use on vehicles after initial vehicle purchase these automotive parts are sold to automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout north america and to major automobile manufacturers for both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs oes the companys current products include i rotating electrical products such as alternators and starters ii wheel hub assemblies and bearings and iii brake master cylinders mpaa obtains used automotive parts commonly known as used cores primarily from its customers under the companys core exchange program it also purchases used cores from vendors core brokers the customers grant credit to the consumer when the used part is returned to them and the company in turn provides a credit to the customers upon return to the company these used cores are an essential material needed for the remanufacturing operations consensus investors believe mpaa is a growth company and this is how management describes it in investor calls which justifies the high pe ratio of x that the stock currently trades at additionally mpaa consistently beats adjusted earnings estimates bloomberg which is taken as a sign of a healthy growing company quarter adj eps estimate adj eps actual  surprise q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    doing a cursory look at its financials we see that the adjusted reports make sense with these claims and show a company that is strong and doing well thesis when mpaa releases its financials it is on an adjusted basis which obscures the true value of assets revenue and cash flows we believe mpaa is severely overvalued for three reasons i earnings and inventory are distorted ii operating cash flow is often negative and iii return on invested capital is poor first we start with true earnings the main value boosting adjusted earnings versus gaap earnings is upfront payments made by mpaa towards customers for exclusivity rights for example mpaa paid autozone nyseazo  million in cash for the right to sell its product exclusively for  years this cost is added back into the adjusted earnings number under the assumption that this is a onetime nonrecurring cost however we disagree with that claim as it is essential to mpaas business model and is in fact reoccurring when such contracts expire this value causes a significant difference between the adjusted and gaap earnings of the company the latter of which has historically been much lower than analyst expectations bloomberg quarter gaap eps estimate gaap eps actual  surprise q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    q    furthermore inventory is distorted in the adjusted financial statements mpaa divides up its inventory into current inventory and longterm inventory its longterm inventory category consists of broken car parts that require additional work before they can be sold this is considered a noncurrent asset for mpaa however in recent filings longterm core inventory was valued at  million whereas mpaas total book value is only  million this raises the question of where the companys true value lies additionally this longterm inventory is growing without control although in mpaas recent earnings call management claimed we have been turning that inventory about six times the company is referring solely to current inventory this is why the turnover rate of inventory for mpaa is one of the best in the industry while the current inventory is being well managed longterm inventory has doubled in the past  years this inventory must either be maintained or used or mpaa must write down some of the broken car parts to better represent its true asset value this necessary correction of true asset value bolsters our claim of the companys unjustifiably high stock price note both longterm inventory and current inventory were taken from mpaas quarterly financials a huge problem in mpaas financials is its negative cash from operations with its most recent cash flow from operations at  million over three months not only does the company often announce negative operating cash flow during quarterly earnings after years of growth but its cumulative cash flow from operations since going public is also negative this implies that mpaa can neither reinvest operating cash nor cover operations solely from running the business this is an issue though it attempts to justify the negative cash flows by stating that it is a growing company we do not see a massive increase in revenue or cumulative net income that support this claim additionally while gaap net income is barely increasing and cumulative operating cash flow is below  ceo cumulative compensation is steadily increasing we believe this is unjustified and is a warning sign for bad management note data was taken from mpaas yearly financials we also see that adjusted net income does not appropriately correspond to cash from operations  mpaa manages to have positive adjusted income whenever it can to put on the image that it is doing well as a business this has been done historically through receivables raising equity and taking on more debt which mpaa considers as part of net income under its adjusted accounting practices instead of increasing cash from operations by turning over more inventory which again is growing at an unmanageable level the company seems to only increase nonoperations cash flow this is a sign that mpaa is not able to grow organically that is the company is not able to use inventory to fuel growth but rather it chooses to use nonoperational cash flow note data was taken from mpaas yearly financials finally with regard to roic management has stated in a recent earnings call q we try and work with return on invested capital north of  and we think we have done that and we think we can sustain that for this  months so we will see where we end up mpaas return on invested capital over the last year was  which is nowhere near the claimed  that management believes the company has reached at the end of the day successful investing is measured by the return on the capital that a person contributes with a low roic mpaa has too high of a risktoreturn ratio to justify its current valuation therefore we believe mpaa is severely overvalued although pe and pfcf are multiples commonly used to value companies we are unable to discern what mpaas true earnings and free cash flows are due to the companys convoluted accounting practices thus we believe a good proxy for the companys true market capitalization is a multiple on its operating cash flow when it is positive we use a pricetooperating cash flow multiple of x as this is on the higher end of its peers additionally we use s operating cash flow for mpaa which is  million company market cap m pricetooperating cash flow ratio lydall inc nyseldl   superior industries international inc nysesup   douglas dynamics inc nyseplow   modine manufacturing co nysemod   motorcar parts of america inc  stoneridge inc nysesri   tower international inc nysetowr   we obtain a share price of around  giving the company even more benefit of the doubt this low price is justified by mpaas true cash flows and the claim that it is actually not a growth company this is furthermore corroborated by mpaas ceo selling  million worth of shares over the last year catalysts we believe there are two main catalysts that will lead to the true realization of mpaa stock price missed earnings and large insider selling we believe that this will occur within a years time frame  although the company can continue to report nongaap values the accumulation of negative operating cash flow will build up to a point where the true values will have to be revealed risks the catalyst event could take a while to occur although analysts are estimating a downward projection of eps over the next few quarters mpaa could continue to use nongaap accounting to mask its woes this would delay the realization of the true stock price but we are confident it will occur eventually furthermore some insider selling has occurred in the past but has not budged the stock price the time to cover shorts is  days as of  although this number is quite high short interest is only  which is not unreasonable additionally the expected return of  more than makes up for the risks of short interest disclosure iwe have no

purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads
