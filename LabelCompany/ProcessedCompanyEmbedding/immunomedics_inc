veltuzumab humanized anticd antibody are safe and active in patients with indolent nonhodgkins lymphoma haematologica   milatuzumab background milatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting tumors that express the cd antigen which is present on a variety of hematological tumors and even on some solid cancers with restricted expression by normal tissues it has received orphan drug designation from the food and drug administration for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or cll milatuzumab is the first anticd antibody that has entered into human testing and we have completed initial phase i studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma nhl or cll the anticd antibody is also being studied subcutaneously in a phase b study in patients with active sle the sle study is supported by a threeyear research grant from the department of defense with a potential funding of  million our interest in pursuing milatuzumab in immune diseases is driven by the observations that implicated cd in antigen presentation—particularly by dendritic and other immune cells—and as a survival factor for rapidly proliferating malignant cells recent findings have determined that cd is a receptor for the proinflammatory chemokine macrophage migrationinhibitory factor and that binding of the factor to cd initiates a signaling cascade resulting in proliferation and survival of normal and malignant b cells such as in cll migrationinhibitory factor is widely expressed by immune cells particularly macrophages and is known to play a role in autoimmune disease thus we believe that milatuzumab by blocking the function of cd could be useful in the management of immune diseases either alone or in combination with other agents—including other bcell antibodies such as epratuzumab and veltuzumab clinical studies lupus sle this is a phase ib study of milatuzumab administered subcutaneously in patients with active sle funded by a grant from the department of

arthritis res ther r  immu background immu is a novel humanized antibody directed against an immune response target hladr for the treatment of patients with bcell cancers hladr is a receptor located on the cell surface whose role is to present foreign objects to the immune system for the purpose of eliciting an immune response increased presence of hladr in hematologic cancers has made it a prime target for antibody therapy although other antihladr antibodies have been developed immu is distinguished by having a different immunoglobulin class igg which does not function by the usual effectorcell activities of antibodies such as complementdependent cytotoxicity cdc and antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc as a result immu does not rely on an intact immune system in the patient to kill tumor cells furthermore because adcc and cdc are believed to play a major role in causing the side effects of antibody therapy we expect immu to be less toxic to patients by targeting hladr a receptor that is different from the antigen targeted by rituximab or other antibodies in development for nhl and other bcell malignancies immu may represent a new tool in the arsenal to combat these cancers clinical studies nhlcll the antihladr antibody is being investigated in a phase i doseescalation study as a monotherapy for patients with nhl or cll references chen x chang ch stein r
