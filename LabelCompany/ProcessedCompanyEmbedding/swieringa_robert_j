scholarly journals it is a great honor for me to be here this evening baruch college has been blessed with a long tradition of outstanding scholars in accounting this lecture honors emanuel saxe who during his  years at baruch was a professor chairman of the accountancy department dean morton wollman distinguished professor of accountancy and university distinguished professor one of his students was abraham briloff who was a member of the accounting faculty for  years and was the emanuel saxe distinguished professor of accountancy i have been an avid reader of professor briloffs articles and used them extensively in my classes over the years the title of my lecture this evening is fasb in my rear view mirror  in two months i will be leaving the fasb after ten and a half years as a member of the board rather than exiting the merritt parkway at exit b i will continue to new haven and quite literally i will see the fasb at  merritt  in my rear view mirror  those of you from connecticut will add the qualifier not exactly but tonight i want to talk figuratively about fasb in my rear view mirror as i leave the fasb i look back on accomplishments disappointments frustrations and continuing challenges during those ten years and i would like to try to put them in perspective perspectives i joined the board in january  following in the footsteps of robert sprouse who was one of the original seven board members in  this was the second time that i tried to follow in his footsteps the first time was when i inherited his business  corporate reporting course at the stanford business school in  when he joined the fasb robert sprouse was not an easy professor to follow he was an outstanding professor he was also an outstanding board member arthur northrop and i were the seventeenth and eighteenth individuals to join the fasb we joined a very strong board that included victor brown donald kirk raymond lauver david mosso and arthur wyatt  at this point all of those individuals have left the board  agenda projects recently there has been increased interest in the productivity and efficiency of the fasb concerns have been expressed about how long it takes to resolve important issues my term on the board provides a perspective about what was and was not achieved during the last ten years the board issued fasb concepts statement  on elements of financial statements and statements  and  about employers accounting for pensions in december  nine items were included on the technical agenda at january   see table  the project on postemployment benefits other than pensions was added in  the projects on accounting for income taxes and consolidations were added in  the projects on financial reporting and changing prices and on nonrefundable loan fees and costs were added in  and the projects on regulated enterprises insurance company issues and cash flow statements were added in  exposure drafts were issued in december  for the projects on nonrefundable loan fees and costs and on regulated enterprises from january   through december   the board considered  possible agenda items and added  of those items to its technical agenda of the  items that were not added to the technical agenda nine items resulted in technical bulletins two items resulted in aicpa pronouncements and four items were deferred during that period the board completed eight of the initial nine projects completed  of the  projects added during that period and removed two items from the agenda in other words  items or  percent of the  available projects were resolved during that period at january   the board had seven items on its technical agenda see table  the project on consolidations that was added in  was not completed during the tenyear period the other six projects were added during that period including the financial instruments project that was added in  the presentvaluebased measurements project that was added in  the earnings per share and liabilities for closure or removal of longlived assets projects that were added in  and the notforprofit organizations project about intermediaries and the comprehensive income project that were added in  exposure drafts were issued in  for projects on consolidations transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities and notforprofit organizations exposure drafts were issued in  on earnings per share disaggregated disclosures liabilities related to closure or removal of longterm assets comprehensive income and derivatives and hedging activities some demographics the  standards issued from january   to december   are listed in table  three observations help to put those standards in perspective first the standards differ dramatically in the amount of time and effort that it took to complete them on average it took about three years to complete a standard but like many averages that average is somewhat misleading the range was from four months to almost twelve years and the median was two years ten standards took less than a year to complete statements    and  reflected deferrals of effective dates statements    and  were amendments to existing standards and statements  and  were narrowscope standards statements   and  took more than ten years to complete statements    and  took more than five years to complete if the four deferred effective date standards statements    and  one technical correction standard statement  and three narrow amendments statements   and  are eliminated from the analysis the average becomes about three years and nine months however if the three standards that took the longest to complete statements   and  are adjusted from the agenda date to the date when serious work began on the development of a standard the average again becomes about three years second the standards were not equally distributed across years given that  standards were issued in ten years the average per year was  standards but that average also is somewhat misleading six standards were issued in  and five standards were issued in  and  four standards were issued in  and  three standards were issued in  and  and two standards were issued in   and  third the standards were not equally distributed across topics eighteen standards focused on three topics  financial instruments eight standards notforprofit organizations five standards and income taxes five standards nine standards focused on three topics  rateregulated enterprises three standards insurance company issues three standards and cash flow statements three standards the remaining nine standards focused on nine different topics the standards i would like to put the  fasb statements that were issued from  through  in context  the year  was very hectic public hearings were held on nonrefundable loan fees and on regulated enterprises projects on accounting for notforprofit organizations and on financial instruments were added to the technical agenda six exposure drafts were issued on financial reporting and changing prices accounting for income taxes cash flow reporting universal life insurance contracts consolidations and depreciation accounting by notforprofit organizations late in  the board issued statement  on financial reporting and changing prices statement  on abandonments and disallowances and statement  on nonrefundable loan fees and costs the hectic pace carried over into  public hearings were held on income taxes and on consolidations statement  on accounting for phasein plans by regulated enterprises statement  on depreciation accounting by notforprofit organizations and an exposure draft on sale and leaseback transactions were issued in august  statement  on consolidation of majorityowned subsidiaries was issued in october  statement  on cash flow statements and an exposure draft on disclosures about financial instruments were issued in november  statement  on accounting for income taxes and statement  on universal life insurance contracts were issued in december  deliberations continued on postemployment benefits other than pensions stock compensation rateregulated enterprises and contributions to notforprofit organizations  relatively few standards were issued during  the board issued four narrow standards in  statement  focused on sale and leaseback transactions statements  and  merely deferred the effective dates of two standards that were issued in  and statement  focused on how to discontinue application of statement  the board focused on implementation problems for applying statement  reconsidered the direction of the financial instruments project based on comments on the  exposure draft and merged the stock compensation project into the liability and equity phase of the financial instruments project the board developed tentative conclusions on the postretirement benefits other than pensions project projects on interest methods and on impairment of longlived assets were added to the technical agenda in  in  the board issued statements  and  which amended statement  on cash flow statements and issued statement  to defer the effective date of statement  exposure drafts on postretirement benefits other than pensions and on disclosures about financial instruments also were issued in  the board continued to deliberate possible amendments to statement  on income taxes the board issued statement  on disclosures about financial instruments and statement  on postretirement benefits other than pensions in  exposure drafts on disclosures about the market value of financial instruments and on contributions to notforprofit organizations were issued in  as well as discussion memorandums on impairment of longlived assets presentvaluebased measurements and distinguishing between debt and equity financial instruments the board continued to focus on financial instruments accounting issues of notforprofit organizations and a possible replacement for statement  on income taxes the board issued statement  on disclosures about market value of financial instruments and statement  to delay the effective date of statement  on income taxes in  the longawaited exposure draft on accounting for income taxes was issued in  as well as exposure drafts on accounting for investments with prepayment risk and discussion memorandums on consolidations financial instruments and new basis accounting  the pace quickened again in  and  the board issued five standards in  including statement  on accounting for income taxes and four relatively narrow standards statement  on investment contracts statement  on technical corrections statement  on postemployment benefits and statement  on reinsurance contracts also in  the board added projects on loan impairments and marketable securities to its technical agenda and issued interpretation  on offsetting and exposure drafts on loan impairments marketable securities accounting by mutual life insurance companies financial statements of notforprofit organizations and contributions in  the board issued statement  on loan impairments statement  on accounting for marketable securities statement  on accounting for contributions and statement  on financial statements of notforprofit organizations exposure drafts were issued on accounting for stockbased compensation and on impairment of assets and interpretation  was issued on mutual life insurance and other enterprises the boards deliberations focused on derivative financial instruments  in  the board issued two narrowly focused standards statement  amended statement  and statement  focused on disclosure about derivative financial instruments the board continued to deliberate issues about stockbased compensation derivatives and hedging asset impairment and consolidation policy the board issued exposure drafts on accounting by mutual life insurance enterprises and on accounting for mortgage servicing rights and interpretation  on offsetting in  the board issued five standards statement  on accounting for certain insurance contracts statement  on impairment of longlived assets statement  on mortgage servicing rights statement  on stockbased compensation and statement  on certain investments held by notforprofit organizations the board also issued exposure drafts on consolidated financial statements on transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities and on a proposed interpretation of certain terms in statement  board deliberations continued on derivatives and hedging and exposure drafts were developed on reporting disaggregated information earnings per share and accounting for closure or removal of longterm assets the board is working hard to issue standards on consolidation policy and procedures and on transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities before   the board is also trying to develop exposure drafts on derivatives and hedging activities and on comprehensive income  accomplishments i believe that the most significant accomplishment during my time on the board was statement  it required new information about the obligation and related costs of postretirement health benefits and changed the way people viewed the obligation and related costs there are various reasons why that standard was successful statement  paved the way for statement  the important battles took place over the extended period to develop and issue statement  statement  was based on the terminology measures and approach in statement  many people were comfortable with the measures and disclosures required by statement  the board and others expected that over time postretirement health and other benefits plans would evolve to be like pension benefits plans and therefore a statement  approach was appropriate entities were experiencing escalating health care costs and those increased costs made this issue more important even in a payasyougo world entities were considering amendments to their postretirement health benefit plans and arrangements the consideration of amendments made some of the arguments for eligibility date more plausible than otherwise the basic issues of recognition and measurement of a postretirement health benefit obligation were appealing to matching and measurement advocates the field test was important in the development of statement  because it demonstrated that the obligation could be measured and it revealed how large the numbers were six seminars were held from april  through june  to describe and discuss the exposure draft the process used to develop statement  worked reasonably well at a crucial point in that process the question changed from whether to recognize and measure the obligation and related cost of postretirement health benefits to how to recognize and measure that obligation and cost the second most important accomplishment was the project on notforprofit accounting statements    and  are having a major impact on the financial reporting of notforprofit organizations members of governing boards and others are finding the new financial statements more understandable and useful because the statements focus on the organization as a whole and on measures of performance and because they will provide a basis for comparing the organizations performance with that of other organizations the third most important accomplishment was maintaining the credibility of accounting for rateregulated enterprises under statement  statement  reflected the environment of costplus regulation that existed when it was developed in the mids that environment began to change the costs of new capacity increased dramatically because of doubledigit inflation construction delays and more stringent nuclear construction requirements after the accident at three mile island the costs of existing capacity some of it excess capacity were also increasing the large rate increases required to cover those costs focused public attention on electric rates and galvanized opposition to rate increases statements  and  were responses to those developments and the changing tone of regulation discussions that took place during the development of statement  on phasein plans led to statement  about how to discontinue the application of statement  deregulation of certain industries and changes in the method of regulating others caused several enterprises to discontinue application of statement  for all or some of their operations in recent years the natural gas industry and telecommunications industries have been deregulated and restructured the eight largest telecommunications companies reported restructuring charges in excess of  billion and have written off regulatory assets in excess of  billion it is expected that electric utilities also will be deregulated and restructured in the years ahead resulting in over  billion of regulatory and other assets being written off disappointments the most disappointing standards have dealt with financial instruments we are in the midst of a sea change in finance fundamental changes in global financial markets have transformed the financial activities of all entities increased volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates and other market prices have greatly increased market credit and liquidity risks efforts to manage those financial risks competition and government deregulation of financial markets and services structural changes in the economies and taxation of different countries and technological advances in computers and information services have stimulated financial innovation the fasb was ahead of the curve when it added the project on financial instruments and offbalancesheet financing to its technical agenda in may  but the fasb has fallen behind the curve in the s after ten years of effort we have yet to come to grips with financial instruments instead of developing broad standards the board has issued a patchwork of inconsistent standards for marketable securities loan impairment and other issues financial instruments include a broad class of items some items can be readily valued other items are difficult to value financial instruments are held by financial institutions so trying to deal with those instruments necessarily requires that the board try to deal with accounting and operating issues that arise in those institutions practices for financial instruments have become well established it is more difficult to change accounting practices when they are well established financial instruments are used in a variety of ways it is difficult to understand their varied uses in setting accounting standards another disappointing project has been consolidations and related matters several issues papers from the aicpa provided the impetus for adding this project to the agenda in  even though the project was added in  it was inactive for a couple of years and the first staff paper was discussed early in  the board disagreed with several important details about the economic unit approach advocated in that paper but instead of pursuing those details the board decided to issue statement  about majorityowned subsidiaries at this point in  the board is still grappling with those details the fundamental issue in this project is the objective of financial reporting a third disappointing item has been the presentvaluebased measurement project that project initially was linked with the project on impairment of assets the interest methods and impairment of assets projects were on a parallel track with discussion memorandums being issued and public hearings being held at about the same times but the discussion memorandum for this project was not successful in defining the issues and alternatives in addition deliberations on this project were usurped by projects on loan impairment and asset impairment and even the example of the warranty obligation used to stimulate discussion drew fire because of ongoing debates about how to measure financial liabilities frustrations the most frustrating standard was accounting for income taxes statement  was fashioned in a net deferred tax liability world discussions about criteria for deferred tax assets shifted from a probability assessment approach to an events approach that reflected very restrictive criteria for recognition the prospects of tax legislation that would reduce corporate tax rates put considerable pressure on the board to develop and issue a standard that would make measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities more responsive to changes in tax rates but then the tax world changed dramatically with the tax reform act of  that act reduced corporate rates but it also made the most significant changes in corporate income taxes in history the act enlarged the tax base by eliminating many items that had created deferred tax liabilities and added an alternative minimum tax that tied income tax calculations to book income measures among other provisions that act changed interperiod tax allocation from a world of tax credits to eventually a world of tax debits the likely effects of that act were not well understood in  and  then the board began serious consideration of postretirement health benefits and corporate america began its restructuring process the recognition of liabilities for those benefits and restructuring provisions accelerated the movement to a net tax debit world the board encountered continuing difficulties in dealing with an increasing list of implementation issues some of which were new and others that were carried over from the debates before the standard was issued changes in board membership and continuing pressures to reconsider decisions in statement  made it even more difficult to reconsider and rethink a recently issued standard that reconsideration process also exposed a very real limitation of the boards process  it focuses on one possible solution at a time rejection of that solution often results in a fresh start another very frustrating standard was statement  on stockbased compensation we could spend the rest of the evening talking about this standard the development of other standards has reflected political behavior however the focus of the stockbased compensation project increasingly was on washington as the project progressed people decided to go around the boards due process they were told by people in washington and elsewhere to participate in our process but their hearts were not in it in addition other political agendas were being pursued by various parties that affected the stockbased compensation project but we learned many things during that project valuation of stockbased compensation is widespread among consultants and academics some companies trade off salaries and bonuses for stockbased compensation some executives choose between bonuses and stockbased compensation some directors choose between fees and stockbased compensation some employees receive annual total compensation reports that include the fair value of stockbased compensation some companies routinely value stockbased arrangements with professional golfers calaway and with college coaches shoe companies an analyst from boston said that the jack was now out of the box but att chairman robert allens remarks last week that atthemoney options have no value at grant date suggest that some senior executives should have participated in the debates on this project  with hindsight the board could have proposed a disclosure solution ten years ago challenges controversy has surrounded many of those  standards i would like to conclude by focusing on several challenges we faced in resolving financial reporting issues fair values one challenge is whether to expand the use of fair values or market values in financial reporting the current accounting model is a mixedattribute transactionbased model that model has worked reasonably well over the years but some believe that this model should be replaced with a fair value model fair value is the price that would be obtained under normal conditions between a willing buyer and a willing seller the public oversight board of the sec practice section of the aicpa has urged the fasb to study comprehensively the possibility of fair value accounting the general accounting office has recommended that the fasb consider the development of a market value rule for all financial instruments however a toplevel government working group on financial markets that included treasury secretary lloyd bensten federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and sec chairman arthur levitt urged the fasb to go slow on market value rules for financial instruments and the aicpa special reporting committee recommended that the fasb not devote attention to valuebased accounting at this time the debate at the fasb has not been about changing to a different model rather it has been about changing the mix of the attributes in the current model the debate has focused on four areas first we have debated whether fair value should be used to initially measure certain assets that debate has taken place in the context of contributions statement  mortgage servicing rights statement  and stockbased compensation statement  contributions and stockbased compensation recognized under statement  are required to be measured at fair value but mortgage servicing rights are required to be measured at carryover basis second we have debated whether fair value should be used to remeasure certain assets when recorded amounts are not likely to be recovered that debate has taken place in the context of loan impairment statement  and asset impairment statement  an assumption inherent in an enterprises statement of financial position prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is that recorded amounts for assets will be recovered if that condition does not hold recorded amounts should be adjusted impaired loans may be recognized at fair value but impaired assets are required to be recognized at fair value third we have debated whether fair value should be used to account for certain assets that are readily marketable that debate has taken place in the context of marketable debt securities statement  during an extended period of reduced interest rates financial institutions reported significant amounts of realized gains while concurrently having underwater investment portfolios that behavior was described as gains trading cherry picking or snacking statement  retains amortized cost for some heldtomaturity debt securities statement  requires that all debt securities held by notforprofit organizations be accounted for at fair value fourth we have debated whether fair value should be used to account for certain assets when underlying rights are unbundled loans or receivables can be pooled or packaged into homogeneous portfolios and transferred to a trust or specialpurpose entity the trust or entity can then issue debt or equity securities that are securitized by those receivables through the securitization process receivables have been unbundled into rights and obligations an exposure draft that was issued in october  proposed that some of those rights and obligations should be recorded at fair value and some should be recorded at carryover basis the debate about fair value currently is taking place in discussions about accounting for derivatives we have been told by the sec chairman that the three most important issues in financial reporting are derivatives derivatives and derivatives statement  improved disclosures about the way entities use derivatives but until recently the board has been at an impasse about how to account for derivatives and hedges the challenge of whether to expand the use of fair values in financial reporting is being driven by the ongoing development of markets and the development of methods to approximate prices in those markets the sweep of the sea change in finance has raised questions about the continued use of amortized cost for many financial instruments present values a second challenge is whether to expand the use of presentvaluebased measurements in financial reporting apb opinion  which was issued in august  requires the use of present values for receivables and payables yet a close reading of opinion  reveals that the use of that method is limited to contractual rights to receive or pay money on fixed or determinable dates moreover trade receivables purchase deposits security deposits lending activities intercompany transactions and certain other taxrelated or restricted receivables and payables are excluded from the requirements of opinion  recent debates have focused on whether presentvaluebased measurements should be used in accounting for loan impairment statement  asset impairment statement  provisions for credit losses and certain environmental liabilities the board issued an exposure draft in february  that focuses on accounting for obligations for certain closure or removal costs of longlived assets such as nuclear power plants measuring those obligations requires estimates of uncertain future events the amounts and timing of expected future payments for closure or removal activities have to be projected over periods ranging from  to  years those payments have to be discounted back to their present value at an assumed interest or discount rate to reflect the time value of money and the discounted amounts have to be allocated between current and future accounting periods between now and then laws and technologies may change actual payments may differ dramatically from expected amounts the challenge of whether to expand the use of present values in financial reporting is being driven by assets and liabilities that are far removed from contractual rights to receive or pay money on fixed or determinable dates the focus is on risky assets and risky liabilities for which actual cash flows may differ dramatically from expected amounts use of estimates a third challenge is whether to expand the use of estimates in financial reporting the use of fair values and present values reflects the use of estimates of cash flows and of other factors in valuation accounting tends to be viewed as objective and precise and as reflecting measures of past transactions and events yet those measures are based on assumptions or estimates about future events estimates are becoming more prevalent because contract relations are increasingly prevalent accounting for contracts is easy if they are simple discrete and of short duration if they reflect limited relations among the parties and if precise measures exist for objects of exchange no further cooperation is anticipated and no sharing relations exist accounting for contracts is difficult if contractual relations are complex and of long duration if they reflect close relations among the parties and if some objects of exchange cannot be measured currently some future cooperation is anticipated sharing relations exist some troubles are anticipated and interactions are assumed complex contractual relations exist for parent and subsidiary relations financial instruments contributions postretirement benefit arrangements compensation plans insurance arrangements warranty and service arrangements regulated enterprises software contracts and so forth accounting for objects of exchange that cannot be measured currently makes extraordinary demands on accountants as measurers consider postretirement health benefits  arrangements that may cover up to  years the benefits are in kind and indexed rather than fixed the contracts are not welldefined like pension contracts and the contracts are changing as arrangements evolve also consider reclamation costs that can cover up to  years decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants and the costs of significant extended warrantees all of those costs rely heavily on estimates of uncertain future events to make initial and subsequent measurements accountants are increasingly making interim measures of unfolding events estimates are difficult changes in estimates are prevalent recent debates have focused on accounting for restructurings a restructuring occurs when an entity makes a fundamental change in its business strategy operations or structure in hope of achieving improved results of operations in future periods often as a result of reduced costs companies in industries that have been deregulated have reported significant restructuring charges restructuring charges have included costs of employee benefits such as costs of severance and termination benefits costs associated with the elimination and reduction of product lines costs to consolidate or relocate plant facilities costs for new system development or acquisition costs to retrain employees to use newly deployed systems and losses on asset impairments and disposals of assets in  the emerging issues task force eitf discussed and reached several consensuses in issue  about when an entity should recognize a liability and an expense for costs associated with a restructuring in addition statement  addresses the accounting for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used by an entity and for longlived assets to be disposed of eitf issue  and statement  likely will result in lower restructuring liabilities and charges and in increased visibility of restructuring activities however eitf issue  and statement  now have been added to the tangled web of pronouncements that may apply to restructuring activities the challenge of whether to expand the use of estimates in financial reporting is being driven by the increased reliance on contractual relations and by the increased uncertainty associated with judgments assumptions and estimates distinctions between organizations the challenges of whether to expand the use of fair values present values and the use of estimates all relate to matters of valuation and measurement a fourth challenge is whether to distinguish between organizations in financial reporting distinctions between organizations are part of the fabric of generally accepted accounting principles those principles developed by industry and their codification became the articulation of generally accepted accounting principles however distinctions between organizations are becoming blurred consider the distinction between governmental entities and other entities that distinction is central to the jurisdiction agreement between the fasb and the gasb that agreement requires that the fasb and the gasb distinguish between entities  yet some organizations are both private and public cornell university where i spent almost twelve years is both governmental and private moreover governmental and other organizations are increasingly engaging in the same transactions and competing in the same markets health care organizations provide both immediate and real examples a distinction is also made between notforprofit organizations and other entities but increasingly notforprofit organizations and forprofit entities are operating in the same markets notforprofit organizations have frequently moved into service areas previously dominated by forprofit entities eg vocational rehabilitation job placement family and other human services and forprofit entities have moved into service areas previously dominated by notforprofit organizations eg health clubs and health care providers distinctions are also made between financial and other entities specialized accounting exists for financial institutions and different requirements exist for savings and loans banks finance companies insurance companies and credit unions but some financial institutions have all of those entities a company like citicorp has savings and loans banks finance companies and insurance companies and some nonfinancial institutions have savings and loans banks finance companies and insurance companies those entities engage in the same transactions and compete in the same markets it is not desirable to have different accounting treatments that depend on which entity engages in a transaction and distinctions are made between us and other organizations we tend to accept the view that because different practices legal systems capital markets tax systems technical methods social norms and so forth exist across countries different accounting treatments are appropriate yet increasingly entities in different countries are engaging in the same transactions and competing in the same markets in particular those entities are seeking capital in the same capital markets international accounting standards a fifth challenge is international accounting standards the fasb has become more active with standardsetting organizations around the world as the market for accounting standards has become global the board has worked closely with standard setters in other countries and with the international accounting standards committee iasc in january  the fasb issued exposure drafts on segment reporting and on earnings per share calculations the segments exposure draft was a joint effort between the fasb and the accounting standards board of the canadian institute of chartered accountants which simultaneously issued an identical exposure draft the eps exposure draft is very similar to one issued by the iasc with which we coordinated our efforts other publications that have resulted from joint efforts include special reports on financial reporting in north america with canada and mexico and on future events hedge accounting and provisioning with australia canada the united kingdom and the iasc during  the fasb formed an american free trade agreement committee for cooperation on financial reporting with representatives of canada mexico and chile to explore areas in which the four countries could more fully cooperate on minimizing differences in their accounting standards the board has become more active in iasc activities a member of the fasb is a member of the iasc consultative group and responds to iasc proposals and attends iasc meetings the board has exchanged staff members with the australian accounting research foundation has had an intern from japan and an accountant from china will join the staff an fasb staff member is working with the uk accounting standards board and a former fasb staff member and consultant is an international accounting fellow at the iasc the board has encouraged visits with standard setters and staff from other countries has shared its work product with other countries and has focused on international standards in discussing financial reporting issues the fasb is committed to promoting the development and acceptance of superior international accounting standards the board will work with other standardsetting organizations to reduce differences in national accounting standards promote cooperative relations and communication between the fasb and other standardsetting organizations and strengthen and formalize its internal policies and procedures for international activities the fasb also will complete an iascus accounting standards comparison study that analyzes similarities and differences and assesses their significance and implications the results of that study will be disseminated broadly however the fasb must decide soon how to respond to the potential acceptance of iasc standards in us capital markets foreign issuers and others are pushing for acceptance of iasc standards by the sec us companies want a level playing field visavis foreign issuers emerging markets need accounting standards as a basis for financial reporting how the fasb responds to these developments may be the most significant and critical actions it takes in the s conclusion congressman henry hyde of illinois has said that when he came to washington he wanted to change the world now he feels lucky if he can leave the room with dignity i didnt come to the board to change the world but i have had an extraordinary opportunity to help shape  standards or about  percent of the fasbs  statements of financial accounting standards  the great american philosopher ann landers has said that there are three types of people in the world those who make things happen those who watch things happen and those who ask what happened i have had a very special opportunity to make things happen in financial reporting when i was at stanford and cornell happiness was teaching and research about accounting issues then i thought that joining the fasb would be happiness for someone who has a keen interest in financial reporting the fasb has been a wonderful opportunity to learn about accounting issues that are swirling anywhere in the world i have been enthralled by those issues and by the judgments that i have been asked to make and i have enjoyed working with the people of the fasb and others who participate in the various social networks and organizations of standard setting standard setting is inherently a social activity and i have worked with and developed friendships with some terrific people but now happiness is returning to teaching and research and the world of academe and

delivered this lecture the views expressed here are those of dr swieringa official positions of the fasb on accounting matters are determined only after extensive due process and deliberations  the context for that title is a song by mac davis entitled texas in my rear view mirror in that song davis describes a teenagers desire to leave lubbock texas happiness is texas in my rear view mirror the teenager faces several challenges in writing songs in hollywood and in wrestling with what is important in life the song concludes with the adult returning to lubbock texas and observing that now

awarded to me and other senior officers by the board late last fall they were options that today have no value absolutely none they are not worth the paper that theyre written on but they do have an incentive for all of us at the senior level to be sure that this restructuring this transition is successful on behalf of atts share owners and its employers and the way they do this if the stock price goes up you benefit the stock price goes up i benefit transcript by strictly business page   the fasb and the gasb recently agreed on a definition of governmental entities  actually i ultimately

has not been whether to use fair value but when to use fair value estimates for uncertainties have become increasingly complex and difficult as exemplified by the accounting for postretirement healthcare benefits and for obligations for certain closure or removal costs of longlived assets such as nuclear plants the current accounting model will be challenged by more flexible and fluid organizational arrangements increased investments in intangible assets more extensive use of financial instruments to manage various risks and changes in information technology full text copyright new york state society of certified public accountants jan  headnote some profound and thoughtful observations for the next  years we come to an age of technology information and global competition with a financial accounting model that was fashioned almost  years ago in the early twentieth century the balance sheet was the most important financial statement cost was viewed as a practical and satisfactory basis of valuation for assets held for use or sale except that fixed assets were depreciated and inventories sometimes were written down to amounts that were below cost the historical cost transactionbased model that emerged in the early s generally has served us well over the years but several areas are unclear and continue to present challenges fair value the current accounting model is a mixed attribute transactionbased model it is often described as based on historical costs but the attributes are not limited to historical costscurrent market values net realizable values and present values are used too that mixedattribute model has worked reasonably well over the years but some believe the mixedattribute model should be replaced with a fairvalue model fair value is the price that would be obtained under normal conditions between a willing buyer and a willing seller the public oversight board of the sec practice section of the aicpa urged the fasb to study comprehensively the possibility of fair value accounting the gao recommended the fasb consider the development of a market value rule for all financial instruments however a toplevel government working group on financial markets that included former treasury secretary lloyd benston federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and sec chairman arthur levitt urged the fasb to go slow on market value rules for financial instruments and the aicpa special reporting committee recommended that the fasb not devote attention to valuebased accounting at this time the association for investment management and research aimr has authorized a comprehensive study and report of the opinions of the entire aimr membership on the role of market values in financial reporting most recently the gao in its report the accounting professions major issues progress and concerns stated its concerns about the mixed model and made a pitch for financial instruments at fair value and more forwardlooking information about opportunities and risks the debate at the fasb has not been about changing to a different model rather the debate has been about changing the mix of the attributes in the current model the debate has not been whether to use fair values but when to use fair values the debate has focused on four questions should fair value be used to initially measure certain assets that debate has taken place in the context of contributions fasb statement no  accounting for contributions received and contributions made mortgage servicing rights fasb statement no  accounting for mortgage servicing rights and stockbased compensation fasb statement no  accounting for stockbased compensation contributions and stockbased compensation are required to be recognized at fair value but mortgage servicing rights are required to be recognized at carryover basis should fair value be used to re remeasure certain assets if recorded amounts are not likely to be recovered that debate has taken place in the context of loan impairment fasb statement no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and asset impairment fasb statement no  accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of an assumption inherent in an enterprises statement of financial position prepared in accordance with gaap is that recorded amounts for assets will be recovered if that condition does not hold recorded amounts generally are adjusted but should those amounts be adjusted to fair value impaired loans may be measured at fair value but impaired longlived assets are required to be measured at fair value should fair value be used to account for certain assets that are readily marketable that debate has taken place in the context of marketable debt securities fasb statements no accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and no  accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations during an extended period of reduced interest rates financial institutions reported significant amounts of realized gains while concurrently having underwater investment portfolios that behavior was described as gains trading cherry picking or snacking statement no  retains amortized cost for some heldtomaturity debt securities but statement no  requires that notforprofit organizations account for all debt securities at fair value should fair value be used to account for certain assets when underlying rights are changed or unbundled loans or receivables can be pooled or packaged into homogeneous portfolios and transferred to a trust or specialpurpose entity that then issues debt or equity securities through the securitization process receivables are changed or unbundled into new rights and obligations should those rights and obligations be recorded at fair value fasb statement no  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities requires that some of those rights and obligations be recorded at fair value and that some be recorded at carryover basis uncertainties another unclear area under the traditional model is how to deal with uncertainties uncertainties about valuations are largely avoided by relying on amounts established in bargained exchange transactions yet the results of transactions must be classified and assets and liabilities represent future benefits or sacrifices some wish to minimize uncertainty by expensing all costs when incurred unless there is clear evidence of future benefit by requiring a rigorous association of costs and revenues or by minimizing the use of estimates and allocations by sticking as close to cash accounting as possible accounting tends to be viewed as objective and precise and as reflecting measures of past transactions and events yet those measures are based on assumptions or estimates about future events all balancesheet accounts reflect estimates and assumptions estimates are becoming more prevalent because contractual relationships are becoming more prevalent accounting for contracts is easy if they are simple discrete and of short duration if they reflect limited relations between the parties if precise measures exist for objects of exchange if no future cooperation is anticipated and if no sharing relations exist accounting for contracts is difficult if contractual relationships are complex and of long duration if they reflect close relations between the parties if some objects of exchange cannot be measured currently if some future cooperation is anticipated if sharing relations exist if some troubles are anticipated and if interactions are assumed complex contractual relationships exist for parent and subsidiary affiliations financial instruments contributions postretirement benefit arrangements compensation plans insurance arrangements warranty and service arrangements regulated enterprises software contracts and so forth accounting for objects of exchange that cannot be measured currently makes extraordinary demands on accountants as measurers consider postretirement healthcare benefitsarrangements that may cover up to  years those benefits are in kind and indexed rather than fixed the contracts are not as well defined as pension contracts are and contracts are changing as arrangements evolve but also consider reclamation costs that can cover up to  years decommissioning costs and the costs of significant extended warranties all of those costs rely heavily on estimates of uncertain future events to make initial and subsequent measurements accountants are increasingly making interim measures of unfolding events estimates are diffcult changes in estimates are prevalent consider the february  fasb exposure draftaccounting for certain liabilities for closure or removal costs of longlived assets measuring those liabilities for longlived assets such as nuclear power plants requires estimates of uncertain future events the amounts and timing of expected future payments for closure or removal activities have to be projected over periods ranging from  to  years the payments have to be discounted back to their present value at an assumed interest or discount rate to reflect the time value of money and the discounted amounts have to be allocated between current and future accounting periods between now and then laws and technologies may change actual payments may differ dramatically from expected amounts the expanded use of estimates in financial reporting is being driven by the increased reliance on contractual relationships and by the increased uncertainty associated with judgments assumptions and estimates a new world the financial accounting model we bring to the new era was shaped by the existing corporate arrangements for large complex and more or less permanent business enterprises that invested heavily in tangible assets that model will be challenged by more flexible and fluid organizational arrangements increased investments in intangible or soft assets more extensive use of financial instruments to manage various risks and changes in information technology alliances and partnerships there is an increased use of alliances and partnerships between telecommunications entertainment and information services companies between pharmaceutical companies between software companies and between technology companies the term merger lite has been used to describe arrangements in which talent and resources are combined but each partner retains the right to link with others and retains its financial and other resources where some alliances and partnerships reflect welldefined legal boundaries that are supported by contractual agreements others reflect organizational arrangements that transcend legal boundaries by using the talent resources or governance structure of more than one entity a virtual entity is formed to emphasize functional considerations highly specific assets are committed to the new arrangements and those assets are integrated to develop and deliver products and services to the market but the ownership of those assets is retained by the partner entities alliances and partnerships essentially decouple decision rights from access to talent resources and sharing relations generally the equity method is used to account for investments in alliances and partnerships but those investments may represent only one of the many features of the arrangements other companies are spinning off singleproduct or singlefunction companies a technology company thermo electron that testified at the public hearing about the october  fasb exposure draft consolidated financial statements policy and procedures has multiple public subsidiaries each with joint ventures licensing arrangements and other links that form and dissolve in just months or even weeks the company spins out certain of its businesses into separate subsidiaries that then sell a minority interest to outside investors as a result of those sales and similar transactions the company records gains in income that represent the companys increased net investment in its subsidiaries those gains have represented a substantial portion of the net income reported by the company in recent years that company has brought the decoupling of decision rights and residual claims and the reporting of those gains to a new art form other companies are following the example of thermo electron intangible or soft assets attention is shifting away from tangible assets to intangible assets companies that are building soft assets are now among the fastest growing segments of our economy service companies are investing significant amounts in employee and other training technology companies are making significant investments in intellectual capital and research and development and retailers and others are investing in internallydeveloped brands customer loyalty and satisfaction levels the sec held a symposium on intangible assets in april  the objective of the symposium was to identify specific financial reporting problems and to explore potential improvements to the financial reporting model the accounting issues about intangible assets are not new in the late os and early s there was a great deal of interest in recognizing investments in research and development and in human resources a subfield called human resource accounting emerged and flourished however a watershed event was the issuance of fasb statement no  accounting for research and develop ment costs in  that statement required that all research and development costs as defined be charged to expense when incurred in issuing statement no  the board expressed concerns about the high degree of uncertainty about future benefits of individual research and development projects at the time the costs are incurred and the lack of a direct causal relationship between expenditures and benefits the board concluded that although future benefits from a particular research and development project could be foreseen they generally could not be measured with a reasonable degree of certainty and therefore failed to satisfy the suggested measurability test for accounting recognition as an asset in march  the fasb received a letter from the software publishers association that requested that the board reconsider fasb statement no  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed the letter noted that where statement no  was based on an inventory model approach sales of software have become more analogous to services or subscriptions than to inventoried goods the letter observed that the product cycle has shortened from several years in the mids to  months in the mids to less than  months today software development is increasingly funded by periodic maintenance fees database software often is updated on a daily basis and some online services charge on a numberofimagesused basis software companies find it increasingly difficult to meet the technological feasibility criteria of statement no  the software publishers association believes realization of software assets has become increasingly uncertain because of ever increasing volatility in the software marketplace compressed product cycles increased competition and diverging technology platforms it further believes that capitalized costs no longer are relevant to most users of financial statements and that the cost and effort to develop the information required by statement no  do not justify the benefit from recording an asset given the high degree of uncertainty in the product development cycle of most software the association believes that software development costs should be classified as research and development expenses and charged to expense when incurred financial instruments in the past  to  years there has been an increased use of financial instruments we have experienced a sea change in finance fundamental changes in global financial markets have transformed the financial activities of all entities increased volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates and other market prices have greatly increased market credit and liquidity risks efforts to manage those financial risks competition and government deregulation in financial markets and services structural changes in the economies and taxation of different countries and technological advances in computers and information services have stimulated financial innovation the boards decision to add the project on financial instruments and offbalancesheet financing to its technical agenda in may  was in part a response to that sea change in finance that project was expected to develop broad standards for resolving accounting issues raised by financial instruments as well as those raised by the inconsistent accounting guidance and practice that had developed for those instruments over the years where the fasb may have been somewhat ahead of the curve in  it has fallen behind in the s after  years of effort the board has yet to come to grips with financial instruments instead of developing broad standards the board has issued a patchwork of inconsistent standards for marketable securities loan impairment and other issues those standards have been contentious because they have raised questions about the continued reliance on bargained exchanges and amortized cost the debate about financial instruments currently is focusing on derivatives there is limited guidance about how to account for derivatives the authoritative literature does not specifically cover many derivatives so accounting for them is based on analogy to existing literature or on what has been done elsewhere in similar circumstances often the accounting depends on the intended use of the derivative and what is said to be the economics of the transaction derivatives are accounted for differently depending on whether they are intended to be used as a hedging instrument some derivatives that receive hedge accounting treatment may actually increase the enterprises exposure to risk fasb statement no  disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments improved disclosures of information about the way entities use derivatives but improved disclosures are not likely to be sufficient the value of some derivatives can change many times faster and many times more than that of most traditional assets and liabilities the fasb has been at an impasse about how to account for derivatives and hedges the hedge accounting model currently used for derivatives is the deferral method that method which dates back to the early s and was developed for simple hedging arrangements links changes in the values of the derivative to a balance or transaction with exposure to market risk and defers certain unrealized and realized gains and losses in the interest of matching the method is complex and its effects are not readily apparent to users of financial statements the authoritative literature has limited the use of that method to specific circumstances a fundamental issue is whether that method should be applied more generally the fasb exposure draft on accounting for derivative and similar financial instruments and for hedging activities was issued in june  while proposing that all derivatives be measured at fair value it maintains many of the concepts of the historic hedge accounting model crossroads the existing mixedattribute transactionbased financial reporting model has exhibited incredible staying power over the years that model made the transition from farm to factory and survived the challenges of the inflationary s and the financialinstitution crisis of the s it also is important to recognize that many of the challenges are at the margin and are not central to the model however i believe financial reporting faces an important crossroads a crossroads is defined as a place where two or more roads meet as a place where different cultures meet or as a crucial point or place two very different paths are being advocated at this crucial point one path is to delimit financial reporting some believe financial reporting has strayed too far from the reporting model that emerged in the early s some believe more reliance should be placed on price aggregates that result from bargained exchanges and on matching revenues and expenses to measure income concerns have been expressed about the increased use of fair values present values and estimates in financial reporting some are concerned that smaller entities are no longer preparing and issuing generalpurpose financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles some also are concerned about the costs of developing those financial statements and the extensive disclosures that are included concerns also have been expressed about the usefulness and cost effectiveness of existing disclosures and about the increasing volume of disclosures in financial statements some have called for the elimination of less useful disclosures and for elimination of redundant requirements that result in essentially the same information being repeated in various sections of a financial report the other path is to expand financial reporting some believe too much reliance continues to be placed on bargained exchanges and on matching revenues and expenses to measure income some believe that value added by productive activity discovery values and gains and losses from price changes and other changes should be recognized in financial statements some believe financial reports should provide more information about plans opportunities risks and uncertainties should focus more on the factors that create longerterm value and should better align information reported externally with the information reported internally i dont know which path will be taken but the outcome of two recent initiatives may provide some indication about the future path of financial reporting the first initiative is the february  fasb invitation to comment recommendations of the aicpa special committee on financial reporting and the association for investment management and research that solicits views on the recommendations made in the december  report of the aicpa special committee on financial reporting that report recommended the development of a comprehensive model of business reporting that would include financial and nonfinancial data managements analysis of those data forwardlooking information information about management and shareholders and background about the company the invitation to comment also solicits views on the recommendations expressed in the november  position paper of the aimr that report describes financial analysis and discusses globalization of capital markets accessibility of computing power and the increase in economic activities that do not fit within the historic cost accounting model that report discusses the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting and recommends improvements for financial reporting issues that the aimr believes will be significant during the s and beyond the second initiative is the june  fasb exposure draft on reporting comprehensive income that proposal can be viewed as a relatively insignificant effort to tidy up the reporting of certain items that bypass the income statement and are reported directly in equity but that view does not adequately reflect the potential of reporting comprehensive income many people have strongly resisted attempts to include gains and losses from price and other changes in reported earnings reporting comprehensive income provides a way to recognize those gains and losses outside of earnings reported earnings can continue to be transactionbased and costbased and gains and losses from price and other changes can be recognized as a component of comprehensive income and reported in statements of income or financial performance reporting comprehensive income would facilitate articulation of financial statements and would make nonowner changes in equity distinct and transparent be consistent with the united kingdoms statement of total recognized gains and losses that was introduced as a supplement to the profit and loss account be consistent with the comprehensive statement of activities that is required by fasb statement no  financial statements of notforprofit organizations be consistent with a growing literature about accountingbased valuation and comprehensive income discussions on these two initiatives will play an important role in determining the future path of financial reporting all the items on the fasbs technical agenda will be completed or very near completion in a short period of time important decisions will be made in the months ahead sidebar in brief at the crossroads the accounting model used today is one developed during the industrial age it has served us well over the years but several areas are unclear and continue to present challenges the debate at the fasb has not been whether to use fair value but when to use fair value estimates for uncertainties have become increasingly complex and difficult as exemplified by the accounting for postretirement healthcare benefits and for obligations for certain closure or removal costs of longlived assets such as nuclear power plants the current accounting model will be challenged by more flexible and fluid organizational arrangements increased investments in intangible or soft assets more extensive use of financial instruments to manage various risks and changes in information technology former fasb member robert swierengas observations clearly and thoughtfully present the challenges for the next generation of standard setting as he states we are indeed at the crossroads in financial reporting author note robert j swieringa phd a former member of the fasb is now a professor in the practice of accounting at the yale school of management johnson

programs interview with dr robert j swieringa by daniels college of business  aug    accountancy blog   commentsthis afternoon i was humbled to speak with one of the leaders in the world of accounting dr robert j swieringa dr swieringa is a daniels alumnus with a jawdropping resume to name just a few of his many accomplishments he was the dean of the johnson graduate school of management at cornell university a board member at the financial accounting standards board and the chair of the board of directors of the graduate management admissions council the organization which creates the gmat currently he is a professor of accounting at cornell a member of the board of trustees of augustana college a member of the board of managers of the partners group private equity fund and a member of the board of directors of general electric dr swieringa kindly took half an hour out of his busy schedule to enlighten me with his wisdom here are some of the things i learned from our conversationforgive when i called dr swieringa i thought i was completely prepared for our interview the plan was to interview him on a landline set to speaker phone and to record the conversation using a colleague’s cell phone unfortunately as soon as i dialed dr swieringa’s number and prepared to press “record” on the cell phone i realized that the cell phone had timed out and was password protected dr swieringa was incredibly gracious when i asked if i could call him back in a moment so that i could get the password for the cell phone i felt terrible for my mistake and could not have been more grateful for dr swieringa’s kindnessdaniels has been a leader in the business world for generations dr swieringa graduated from augustana college with his ab in economics a motivated and brilliant student he took classes over his summers and graduated in the middle of the academic year the flexibility of the daniels program meant that dr swieringa could begin his mba program in the spring rather than having to wait for a traditional fall start in addition accounting students from daniels were known for achieving high scores on the examinations they had to take after graduation and the school came highly recommended by one of dr swieringa’s professors who was a daniels alumnus a passion for daniels runs in the swieringa family four decades after dr swieringa graduated his son john earned an emba at the collegethe faculty at daniels is one of its greatest assets dr swieringa said that the faculty at daniels was one of the most valuable parts of his mba experience and he even recalled three of his favorite professors by name later on when he became a professor himself he incorporated some of their teaching techniques to help illustrate concepts to his own students dr swieringa expressed his support of our current dean dr chris riordan and praised the innovative changes she is making for the students of danielswhen struggling with periods of difficulty and selfdoubt remember that everything moves in cycles i asked dr swieringa how he has dealt with periods of selfdoubt on his path to success he explained that he had developed the perspective that dark times do not last forever difficulties will arise but it’s important to remember that life is cyclical and hard times will end eventuallypersistence is a key to success dr swieringa was friends with charles schultz the creator of peanuts often mr schultz would be working on fifteen different strips at once occasionally he would have to scrap one but that did not stop him from making the other fourteen into masterpieces and from becoming one of the most successful cartoonists of all time achieving this success meant developing the abilities to face hard work head on and to handle many projects at oncereach out to others when dr swieringa was a student at daniels he was part of a group of students who met for lunch or coffee every day if someone needed help with something he would write his question or problem on the blackboard and the entire group would help him solve it whether you’re an mba student or a businessperson or both you don’t live in a selfcontained bubble it’s tempting to think that you can solve every problem on your own but this kind of thinking can box you in and impede progress reaching out to others is an invaluable way to break through challenges you don’t have to do everything alone and you will be more successful if you learn to ask for helpdo well but also do good in your path to success it’s essential to remember to give back to others dr swieringa has been involved with a wide variety of charitable organizations over the years and as a proud alumnus of daniels he is committed to giving back to his alma mater  in fact study room  is named after dr swieringa and his son john  finding altruistic passions and remembering those who contributed to your success are just as important as doing well for yourselfsurround yourself with intelligent people while working as an assistant professor of accounting at stanford dr swieringa met dr robert t sprouse who was one of the founders of the financial accounting standards board fasb because dr swieringa knew dr sprouse he was able to be a direct participant in this board during an exciting and monumental time in the world of accounting and had the opportunity to share knowledge with some of the most brilliant minds in the country in settings both formal at fasb meetings and informal over coffee or lunchwork to develop an interdisciplinary perspective dr swieringa had taken courses in psychology and sociology while earning his ab in economics and he wanted to continue his studies in the behavioral sciences while earning his phd in accounting at the university of illinois unfortunately the head of the program to which he was applying did not understand why an accounting student wanted to study organizational behavior and grilled dr swieringa for four hours about his intentions in the end dr swieringa’s earnestness convinced the program director to admit him and he earned a phd in accounting and complex organizations the classes offered in the daniels mba program expose students to many different disciplines daniels is an excellent place to develop what dr swieringa calls “a high tolerance for ambiguity” and to learn how to consider diverse and multiple perspectives while solving problems and making decisions student should take advantage of the unique opportunity daniels provides to learn to view the world and the challenges they face through a wide variety of lensesappreciate accounting textbooks based on realworld case studies they haven’t been around forever today we take for granted the fact that accounting textbooks are based on realworld case studies when dr swieringa was studying accounting this wasn’t the case many textbook problems were disconnected from the way accounting worked in the real world in his teaching and later on when writing his textbooks dr swieringa challenged students by presenting them with realworld problems which didn’t have straightforward answers rather than performing simple calculations to figure out the solutions students had to go deeper to figure out the thought processes behind the numbers on the pagethe daniels values of community excellence and ethics were reflected in every one of dr swieringa’s responses  one of his closing remarks was that he was proud to have earned his mba from daniels  i am honored to stand on the shoulders of giants like dr swieringa and i am deeply grateful
