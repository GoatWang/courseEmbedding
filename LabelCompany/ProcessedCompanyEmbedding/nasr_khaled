khaled nasr khaled nasr has filed for patents to protect the following inventions this listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the united states patent and trademark office uspto new gadoliniumbased contrast agents for sensitive detection of zn with mri publication number 0 abstract in some aspects the present disclosure provides novel ligands which may be used to make novel mri contrast agents for the detection of zinc in further aspects by the present disclosure also provides methods of using as imaging agents and compositions thereof type application filed march  0 publication date april 0 0 applicant the board of regents of the university of texas system inventors christian preihs jing yu veronica clavijo jordan yunkou wu khaled nasr a dean sherry sara chirayil apparatus and method for disabling rf signal transmissions from wireless network modems patent number  abstract an apparatus and method is provided for disabling radio frequency signal transmissions from a wireless communications network modem when in proximity to sites where explosive devices are being detonated the apparatus includes an input switch to signal a command to the modem to disable the transmitter portion of the modem or to tune the transmitter to a null gateway on the wireless communications network by disabling transmissions from the modem accidental detonation of explosive devices is prevented when the modem is moved a safe distance away from the explosive devices the transmitter is reenabled automatically type grant filed june  00 date of patent november  0 assignee geotrac international inc inventor amr khaled nasr system and method for submicron level cleaning of surfaces publication number  abstract an apparatus is used for removing contaminants from a surface and includes a chamber filled with a clean process gas a surface positioning device a carbon dioxide snow spray nozzle a laser beam generator and focusing device and a process gas nozzle the nozzles and a focal point of the laser beam are linearly aligned the surface is held at a desired position and bombarded with carbon dioxide snow and with a high pressure wave to release the contaminants from the surface whereupon the released materials are swept to one side of the surface by a jet of the process gas the process may proceed with point to point contamination removal based on prior surface examination and discovery of contamination sites or may be scanned with essentially continuous contamination removal type application filed march  0 publication date october  0 inventors waleed nasr khaled nasr laser induced shockwave surface cleaning publication number  abstract an apparatus and method for cleaning the surface of a substrate using laserinduced plasma shockwaves and ultraviolet radiation is described after defects such as organic inorganic and metallic particles are detected during an inspection step the substrate is mounted on a motorized stage inside a cleaning chamber a laser beam is focused into a lasercleaning nozzle within the chamber the laser energy generates a laserinduced plasma shockwave inside the nozzle the shockwave is amplified and exits the nozzle generating the necessary force to overcome the adhesion bond of the defects with the substrate coordinating defect locations from the preliminary inspection step the substrate is actively positioned only where defects are present for selective removal type application filed october  00 publication date april  0 inventors

international inc inventor amr khaled nasr robotic storage buffer system for substrate carrier pods patent number 0 abstract a storagebuffering system for the stocking andor buffering of substrate andor substrate carriers in a process environment includes a axis robot an endeffector is connected with the robot providing an additional one degree of freedom and a mechanism for grabbing and moving of substrate andor substrate carriers the robot is mounted in an inverted orientation to a removable service cart for easy removal of the robot to a service area in the event of breakdown the robot receives commands from a programmable controller connected to control the robot and configured to direct the arm of the robot through a set of movements product is loaded in and out of the system through io load ports product is stored inside the storagebuffering system on a plurality of storage locations each with product presenceabsence detect sensor the robot can alternatively be mounted directly to the storage system enclosure structure type grant filed december  00 date of patent may  00 assignee seminet inc inventors amro nasr khaled nasr waleed nasr ask a lawyer question add
