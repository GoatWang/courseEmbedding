to public finance and development of basic skill sets opportunity to work with deeply skilled and experienced public finance professionals ability to use it as a launch pad to your next steps in public finance worklife balance and the ability to really get to know your coworkers given its small size can take on a lot of responsibility if you start working with the right teamspeopleconssadly there is a real opportunity given the firms small size and experienced professionals to develop a robust program for analyst and associates however the firm is run by deal junkies and not managers which might not sounds like an issue but it really creates more problems under the hood than one would believe the high amount of turnover is evidence of this it is also a very old schooled finance firm in its culture  you eat what you kill so for junior or support professionals you will never be well paid or given much of a bonus until you are in a position to bring in transactions you will be hard pressed to find advancement opportunities this also creates a lot of tension between lead bankers which puts junior staff in awkward positions more often than they need to be the firms operational it infrastructure lacks investment which means you will be shifting through many files pulling your hair to find answers to many questions in rfps that should really be housed better that also translates into a competitive disadvantage as compared with other firms who will be able to pull more accurate and robust data to be used for client pitchesadvice to managementthe lack of strategic vision creates a chaotic approach to the day to day business high turnover and more roadblocks than necessary for future growth find a focus in public finance and become the market leader in that space  wasting time and resources to chase everything ensures that nothing happens there is an opportunity with the firms platform for a lot of growth but the current mgmt is not able to capitalize on it the firm is a prime example of a small business that has a lot of potential to unlock value but is unable to due so because of the inabilities and resistance from its owneroperator finding a competent leadership team with the experience desire and ambition to revamp the firms platform is needed more each day until then expect the firm to continue to experience high turnover infighting between its lead bankers inability to compete on par with other public finance firms stunted growth ruined relationships and most disastrous failure to best serve current and future
