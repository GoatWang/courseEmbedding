west and centraleastsouthern fuel subsidy pipeline repairs hinder nigerian national petroleum corporation profitability by ejiofo alike  this day nigeria july   the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc is currently unable to make profits from its operations because it is subsidising consumption of petrol by nigerians and also paying heavily to repair and maintain its networks of pipeline that run across the country its monthly financial and operations reports have revealed according to the first five operations reports the nnpc has released so far in  it has raked up as much as n  on under recovery for importation and sale of petrol in the country the nnpc also recorded a trading deficit of n billion in may n billion in april n billion in march as well as n billion and n billion respectively in february and january  the reports which were obtained by thisday yesterday in abuja explained the operations of the corporation in nigeria’s downstream sector from january to may they also suggested this was impacting heavily on the nnpc’s books in the downstream petroleum sector under recovery happens when the expected open market price of petrol pump price per litre which comprises the cost of importation and distribution of petrol like marketers’ margins landing cost freight cost administrative charges and lightering or shiptoship charges is below the federal government’s approved official retail price at the service stations the corporation at the moment has become the sole importer of petrol in nigeria doing close to  per cent of importation and as such bearing the burden of keeping up the country’s petrol supplies its monthly financial reports for january february march april and may however indicated that it had been doing this at the expense of its corporate profitability the reports quoted nnpc’s under recovery from its supplies and distribution of petrol in january to be n that of february was n while for march it recorded a n under recovery for april it was n and n in may to bring the corporation’s total under recovery on petrol supplies for these months to n thisday also learnt from sources in the nnpc and ministry of petroleum resources that subsidy on petrol was back but that the government was quiet about it these sources explained to thisday that since subsidy payments was not provided for in the  budget the nnpc was asked by the government to ensure that it keeps up petrol supplies in the country the corporation though has a products supplies framework –direct sales – direct purchase dsdp in which it commits parts of its  barrels a day bd daily domestic allocation to third parties or refiners in return for equivalent worth of products similarly in may  the minister of state for petroleum resources dr ibe kachikwu confirmed in a podcast message that the nnpc was recording under recoveries in its petrol importation and supplies kachikwu explained that the operational environment had changed since may  when the government opted for a price modulation mechanism in the downstream petroleum sector as against full deregulation of the sector hence the under recoveries he stated then “when we did all these pricing for crude oil was more in the  to  per barrel today it is in excess of  which is fantastic because it means that our revenue stream is improving “but it is a twin window whenever the price of crude oil goes up obviously the price of refined petrol goes up and we begin to have systemic challenge in terms of the pricing on the local base” “so that gap has begun to return and today what you find is that the nnpc continues to import massively on behalf of the federal government it has gone back to about  to  per cent for the whole country therefore its books are absorbing some of the cost implications of this” he added the minister also confirmed that independent marketers were no longer importing petrol into the country according to him “the second is that once this happens the marketers begin to shift backwards participation by individual marketers to help us continue the normal business and marketing cycle that should be what you expect does no longer exist most of them are not importing” but it was not only subsidy for petrol that has kept nnpc on a deficit trend in its operations as its reports indicated that crude oil and products losses as well as expenditure on repairs of its pipelines had equally contributed in great measures for crude oil losses within the periods the report noted that in january the corporation recorded a loss of n february – n march – n april – n and may – n to bring the total to n on product losses nnpc in march lost n in april it was n and may – n to sum it up to n no product losses in january and february  were recorded similarly expenditure on pipeline repairs and management for january was n february – n march – n april – n and may n related stories daily gas supply to power plants increases by  in may …
