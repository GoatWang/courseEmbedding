foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search the sudden departure of klaus kleinfeld from arconic its ceo is on his way out after allegations of threats heres the context and what will probably happen next for arconic motley fool staff apr   at pm this week aluminum company arconics nysearnc ceo klaus kleinfeld was surprisingly ousted from his position by investment manager elliott management which claimed kleinfeld had mailed them an intimidating or threatening letter in this clip from industry focus energy motley fool analysts sean oreilly and taylor muckerman explain whats happening with the corporate seat change the context behind it and why it matters and what this might mean for arconic going forward a full transcript follows the video this video was recorded on april   sean oreilly we have to briefly talk about whats going on with arconic basically this week the sudden ouster of its ceo klaus kleinfeld arconic is the lightweight metals and engineering manufacturer its the successor  taylor muckerman well not successor because alcoa nyseaa still exists  oreilly it spun off the original aluminum production operations and this is the advanced stuff so alcoa took the name muckerman alcoa kept the aluminum production and they spun off the aluminum products division into arconic oreilly yeah it was interesting to me because in every press release ive ever seen for this or analysis arconic is not mentioned as a spinoff its just were separating and thats it muckerman yeah i guess maybe not a spinoff technically  oreilly but bottom line thats just semantics to this point this happened about six months ago the guy that steered arconic through this process of becoming an individual company was again ceo klaus kleinfeld total surprise  it was announced on april  that kleinfeld has been forced out by investment manager elliott management this is actually where it gets even weirder arconic said that mr kleinfelds exit came after he sent an unauthorized letter to elliott management that arconics board of directors said showed poor judgement the company then said that mr kleinfeld is stepping down by mutual agreement i dont know what was in this letter that sounds awesome if somebody knows tweet at me i guess elliott said in a statement that the letter from mr kleinfeld read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of elliott management based on completely false insinuations a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the board whoa muckerman yeah i would believe them if they didnt already want him out of there for over a year this is just their excuse oreilly thats the final cap on this whole  muckerman they were probably poking the bear for a year and he finally woke up from hibernation oreilly arconic is going to have a shareholder meeting on may  and they had it on the docket to get him out that letter i want to know whats in that letter that sounds insane from a professional ceo of a large corporation muckerman yeah if youre a shareholder of alcoa  because hes been the ceo of alcoa before the split  he pushed back against the split in  and  when the price of commodities started to fall eventually succumbing to investors demands and successfully overseeing the split and then taking control as the ceo of arconic hes a visionary he has longterm visions for arconic not these nearterm visions that elliott management has if you look at his success at alcoa and arconic now as a businessman and a relationship man with their customers boeing was going to go all composites they were going to completely eliminate the aluminum products that they used from alcoa and now arconic he had the ceo come to their plant they hashed it out and they proved that they needed to remain an arconic customer and its one of their biggest contracts and then you see the ceos of airbus on top of boeing united technologies and to general electric aviation all voicing their support for klaus kleinfeld but elliott management they have some ulterior motives some shortterm motives im sure oreilly this is not news yeah muckerman the stock did pop a little bit but all these reports you see about his track record in the market for alcoa all say oh this stocks done so poorly since hes been there but they never mention the fact that the price of aluminum has also done quite poorly since he was ceo oreilly right lemons out of lemonade last thing before we move on what you were talking about hes a visionary when the split happened six months ago i saw it mentioned in the wall street journal he had this big long production video of the future  years from now and hes like were going to build the future these towers with robots were going to build it all and its like oh my gosh this guy is thinking longterm muckerman using arconics products as fools we appreciate that and as fools we dont appreciate at least i dont appreciate what happened im going to keep my eye on him and see where he ends up if he doesnt choose to retire i think somebody is going to want him on their board or in their csuite id be interested which company that is hopefully theyre public so i can follow along  sean oreilly has no position in any stocks mentioned taylor muckerman owns shares of general electric the motley fool owns shares of general electric the motley fool has a disclosure policy article info apr   at pm energy materials and utilities stocks alcoa nyseaa  up   arconic inc nysearnc

  profiles  jan  in  the price of aluminium plummeted from over  per tonne to below  per tonne causing the stock price of alcoa – one of the largest aluminium producers in the world to head in the same the direction the outlook was grim but fortunately for alcoa the firm had just signed up a ceo who had the skills and talent to steer the aluminium producer through one of the more difficult periods in it history born in bremen in germany kleinfeld began his career as a marketing consultant in  but before long had joined siemens the global engineering and technology services firm and one of germany’s greatest companies kleinfeld started out as an advertising and design manager in  but swiftly rose through the ranks and was appointed ceo of siemens corp in the us in  and then returned to germany as head of strategy where he was promoted to the siemens ag ceo spot in  along the way he acquired a phd in strategic management from the university of wuerzburg and an mba from the university of goettingen he arrived at the helm of siemens during a tough time for the organisation but as ceo kleinfeld tried to bring to siemens ag some of his experience from running the business in the us some of the american can do entrepreneurial attitude he introduced new labour terms extending working hours sold off some poor performing units on the handheld set side merged the computerservices units and software divisions and engineered a tie up with nokia despite some fierce criticism of his approach his rewiring of the german firm boosted sales profits and market capitalisation unfortunately for kleinfeld his time at siemens came to an unsatisfactory conclusion when the company was engulfed in a well publicised bribery scandal kleinfeld wasn’t implicated but nevertheless resigned following the firm’s chairman heinrich von pierer out of the door it wasn’t long though before kleinfeld was back in the corporate fray when he joined alcoa in the summer of  incorporated in  as the not so catchy pittsburgh reduction company alcoa from the aluminum company of america is one of the world’s leading producers of primary and fabricated aluminum and alumina the company founded by charles martin hall who invented a process to extract aluminium from its bauxite ore swiftly progressed from smelting to selling aluminium kettles to the extraction and manufacture of raw materials and even power generation today the firm employs  employees in  countries and its products make up over  percent of the aluminium alloys used in aircraft and millions of aluminum drinks cans as well as alloy wheels and various building productskleinfeld was not to know it but he joined the firm just as it headed into one of the most turbulent periods in its  year plus history in the twelve months from mid  aluminium prices tumbled some  percent unsurprisingly alcoa’s stock price took a big hit the stock which momentarily hit a peak of  in july  slumped to below  in  before climbing back towards  as  drew to a close there is some way to go before shareholders can recapture some of the value they lost during the slowdown  but kleinfeld hasn’t been idle as he explained to susie gharib on pbs’ nightly business report in october “we have used the downturn to really restructure our cost base” he said “we have cut a lot of costs out become a very lean company and at the same time driven for further innovation and further growth and that’s all coming back” one issue for kleinfeld is delivering growth continued growth amidst considerable economic uncertainty yet encouragingly alcoa raised its expectations for global aluminium demand in  to  percent and while stock watchers often focus on china as kleinfeld has pointed out in the past it is a global market and there is increased demand from places such as india and countries in south east asia  in fact kleinfeld is optimistic about global demand “in countries such as china brazil india and russia more and more people are moving into the middle class driving demand in building and construction transportation and packaging” the ceo said in a q earnings statement and in china where one nation’s economic growth is driving corporate growth across the world kleinfeld talks about demand for aluminium up some  not that markets closer to home should be ignored he notes with both the aerospace and auto sectors in the us showing strong growth another important issue for kleinfeld is sustainability the firm has won a bunch of awards for its csr performance but making real progress on social and environmental responsibility is not always easy for a metals and mining firm kleinfeld’s comment in an interview for special world economic forum edition of the magazine swiss style makes it clear that he is committed to making a difference by continuing improving the firms’ performance on sustainable business practices “sustainability is in our dna and has been guiding us since before the word even existed” he says as kleinfeld notes the firm has cut back greenhouse gas emissions by  percent since the s and the properties of aluminium are useful when it comes to sustainable performance as the company’s website points out “approximately  percent of all of the aluminum ever produced since  is still in active use today” a good example of alcoa’s and kleinfeld’s intentions on sustainability for example is the introduction of an iphone app in late  to help consumers find recycling centres and keep track of the money they earn back through recycling aluminium products and kleinfeld doesn’t just want to deliver good results although with yearonyear sales up five percent in the third quarter of  and the company’s smelters on their way to producing  million metric tons of aluminium in  – an  percent capacity utilisation rate up from  percent in the second quarter – he certainly seems to be doing that but kleinfeld also has a distinct take on the kind of leadership required to be successful in the global economy he made his views on the subject clear during a speech to business school students at wharton business school in  leaders in global business world should be challenging themselves to improve their performance be willing to delegate and not over controlling they should be entrepreneurial but responsibly so “if you dig a hole in the ship below the water line you risk the entire ship sinking that kind of entrepreneurial behaviour is not a good idea” he noted in addition you should respect your colleagues and engage in dialogue with others and while maintaining a degree of independence not sacrifice team spirit as a result “nobody’s perfect but a team can be” he says now that sounds like the kind of leader you would want in charge of your company alcoa it seems is in safe hands wooteothith the most classical monogram series its major lightweight canvas the creation technique is really complex this canvas is with high withstanding

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
