sadist later a spree rapist and spree killer backgroundedit lewis was apparently born in harlan county kentucky on august   as lewis williams lewis revealed that his father used to drive him to his babysitters house and put him in front of the tv to watch cartoons while he went into the back and had sex with the babysitter lewis recounted that one day his father was passed out drunk while they were at the babysitters house because of this his babysitter began to perform fellatio on lewis instead his father regained consciousness in the middle of the act and assaulted and brutally raped her in front of his son afterwards he took lewis to dairy queen for ice cream lewis later claimed it was one of the best days of his life in  he abducted and raped the mother of his girlfriend when she tried to break them up though lewis was caught the da was unwilling to put the victim on the stand to testify as she was a junkie and the charges were dropped in  lewis kidnapped two roommates in alabama and raped and tortured them for three straight days in a fishing cabin they managed to escape and reported him to police but lewis avoided prosecution again because both victims were too traumatized to testify in open court so his lawyer got him off his name was misspelled on the paperwork as louis williams so the record failed to follow him this gave lewis the idea of using aliases that sounded similar to confuse police records that would mistake it for simple spelling errors in  lewis appeared in maryland where his name was further misspelled as william lucas and he went to trial for the rape and seconddegree murder of his thengirlfriend who was also his defense attorney from alabama his new lawyer however found another boyfriend of the victim and created reasonable doubt resulting in lewis acquittal at some point lewis was sentenced to rehabilitation in an inpatient addiction facility in long island ostensibly due to a drug addiction he suffered from while taking medication for back pain her negotiationedit in february  lewis was transferred out of the facility and into a halfway house in brooklyn one day lewis starts taunting jose which causes jose to almost scald his hands in the running water when asked by jose if he doesnt mind the heat lewis in response turns up the heat on the burners places his fingertips on the cooking surface and burns his fingers while he laughs lewis then tries to leave but jose tells him that he has cleanup to do in response lewis forces joses hand on the cooking surface burning his hand he then leaves for central park where he flashes two female international tourists and is caught in the act by a yearold woman named alice parker moments after he is arrested by detective rollins who was playing fetch with her dog nearby police efforts to identify him are complicated by his burnt fingertips and an absence of physical identification or anyone who could verify his identity despite this rollins calls in the rest of the svu operating on a hunch that lewis is more than he says he is during interrogation lewis gives various lies to svu detectives about his personal life and background he is later arraigned on public lewdness and given a plea bargain by ada barba where he will only have two days of community service if he pleads guilty despite the offer lewis seduces his attorney vanessa mayer into declining barbas offer and explains that he doesnt want to plead guilty to something he didnt do he is then released from police custody given that the charge of indecent exposure was only a class b misdemeanor soon after however he tracked alice down and raped and tortured her at gunpoint for eighteen hours straight the attack was briefly interrupted by an unknowing captain cragen who informed alice that she had to testify at lewis trial but she managed to wave him away without incident after the attack was discovered and alice is taken to a hospital lewis was immediately suspected of it he was tracked down to a bodega store and arrested by rollins and detective fin during interrogation lewis claims that he had left the halfway house out of dissatisfaction for it however he tauntingly tells detective benson how he tortured alice all the while refusing to eye detective amaro benson pretends to be highly interested in lewis in order to get more information out of him he then tells benson that it was all hypothetical right after mayer arrives the police attempt to do a lineup identification with alice but lewis pretends to attempt suicide so he could avoid that during the trial where lewis appears via teleconference the judge approves mayers request for a psychiatric evaluation under the basis that he is not competent to stand trial and that he is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity later after svu uncovers his criminal record barba argues that lewis is competent to stand trial because of his previous charges and intimate knowledge of the judicial system while mayer argues that lewis was unlawfully harassed by the state however lewis decides to proceed with the trial and is ruled competent by a judge later benson and cragen find that alice died of a heart attack due to the trauma of the rape and torture on her with the loss of the prosecutions lead witness barba tries to offer a plea bargain with lewis where he pleads guilty to thirddegree sexual assault and grand larceny and will be sentenced to four to seven years in prison however he and mayer turn down the offer again and say that the svu has a vendetta against lewis during the trial mayer works to discredit the evidence and svus testimonies it was then found by an independent investigator hired by mayer that the dna evidence was mishandled when it was tested in improperly cleaned equipment lewis and mayer seize upon that revelation as a good reason to deem it inadmissible in court mayer also points out that alice was so traumatized that she might not accurately remember the face of her attacker creating plausible deniability and leading to a mistrial being declared in addition lewis was released on bail posted by mayer immediately after he breaks into bensons apartment holds her at gunpoint when she arrives home and binds and gags her surrender bensonedit for the next several hours lewis tortures and humiliates benson by forcing her to ingest sleeping pills whiskey and vodka while burning her with cigarettes and heated keys after some time benson loses consciousness upon regaining consciousness she tries to negotiate with him telling him to leave the state now and she will not tell anyone about what happened in exchange however lewis doesnt believe her and forces her to listen to a phone message left behind by her boyfriend brian cassidy who says that he is stuck at his workplace in a bronx courthouse and will not be coming home in a while she attempts to resume negotiation but lewis claims that they are past that stage now benson then warns lewis that she is an officer with the nypd and that the svu along with the entire department will be coming after him when they realize she is missing she adds that he has put people through hell but that it will rain back down on you however he isnt daunted by the warning says let it rain and knocks her out by pistolwhipping her kidnapping benson lewis returns to his halfway house intimidates silva into handing over his car keys and takes his car two days later he picks up mayer and has dinner with her and her parents at the family house in bellport with benson still bound and gagged in the trunk afterwards lewis drops off mayer at the train station and returns to her parents home where he attacks her father herb binding and gagging him with duct tape and leaves him to die of a heart attack he then proceeds to rape and torture her mother liz with benson being forced to watch lewis would escalate lizs torture if benson shut her eyes finally after leaving liz bound in her closet lewis steals her credit card and car and drives around the coast with benson looking for a suitable house to slowly rape and torture her while en route lewis stops by a hardware store and using the mayers stolen credit card purchases rope ducttape wire and a handheld blowtorch intending to use them when he tortured benson during the stop he gives benson more vodka and then some water and warns her one move lights out lewis proceeds to go back on the road and as he drives he taunts benson by singing along to music shortly after a police officer pulls him over for running a blinking red light lewis realizes the officer is a rookie and warns benson that he will kill him if she makes a move when the officer approaches him lewis attempts to negotiate his way out of the situation however the officer notices the alcohol and then benson lying between the seats prompting lewis to kill him afterwards he takes his gun badge and patrol car using the latter to carjack a young woman and her infant child leaving them both in the trunk of the patrol car finding a seemingly vacant house in yaphank lewis settles in there throws benson on the bed and chains her to it with her own handcuffs after helping her go to the bathroom ditching the stolen minivan in front of another house to throw off any suspicion lewis returns and taunts benson asking if there was anyone she wanted to see one last time at first she remains steely but her resolve soon breaks and she begs that she will do anything to live lewis prepares to cut bensons clothes off when a maid working at the house viva nuñez arrives with her young daughter luisa while initially eager to chase viva away lewis changes his mind when he spots luisa and instead chooses to rape torture and murder both as well while he was preparing to do so benson taunts lewis with how pathetic he was to prey on old women and children and accuses him of not being man enough to get it up for a real woman she then adds that she believes he was afraid of her intent on proving her wrong lewis unbuckles his pants but at that moment benson breaks a bar off the iron post of the bed and strikes lewis face with it immediately lewis attempts to grab his gun from the adjacent night table but benson breaks his arm with the post and kicks him in the groin benson then grabs the gun and holds it to lewis warning him one move lights out however he remains calm saying that if she wants to be in control he would let her as he could play with that she then pistolwhips him and knocks him out benson proceeds to free herself and cuff lewis to the bed then release viva and luisa returning to lewis who was still seemingly knocked out benson voices her disgust and hatred towards him and her desire to torture and kill him before admitting that he might enjoy that too revealing himself to still be conscious lewis attempts to goad benson into killing him then explains his childhood to her this disgusts benson who believed he was trying to obtain some degree of sympathy from her however lewis confesses that he enjoyed the incident where his father violently raped his babysitter as it was when he learned the reason for why he was born even more horrified by this benson points the gun at his face preparing to shoot him but ultimately relents from killing him however lewis comments i knew it you dont have the balls benson snaps takes the bed post again and bludgeons lewis repeatedly seemingly to death she then calls svu and the police who arrive and take lewis away fin then reveals to a shocked benson that lewis had survived psychotherapistedit lewis acting as his own defense questions olivia during his trial lewis was to stand trial for three separate crimes bensons assault kidnapping and rape the rape of liz mayer and the concurrent murder of her husband herb and the murder of the police officer during the traffic stop first he stood trial for the attack on benson with his defense being that it was all consensual and that the new york police department has a vendetta against him following a pretrial motions hearing lewis announced through his attorney martha marron that he wanted to plead guilty to multiple counts of firstdegree rape and sodomy on benson even though that never happened his intent was to stand up in open court and provide a false narrative of what he did to benson even though he will receive a sentence of  years to life and die in prison and she will not have to testify in a trial benson refuses to let barba take the deal when barba turns down the offer lewis asks the judge to dismiss marron as his attorney and allow him to represent himself in the trial the judge allows lewis to be his own attorney but has him keep marron as cocounsel during the course of the trial lewis feigned injury from permanent scars on the left side of his face claimed partial blindness in his eye and deafness in his left ear and limped in the courtroom he continually questions the integrity of svu while crossexamining fin and rollins statements when he crossexamines amaro lewis references bensons allegedly sexually provocative nature during one of his interrogations and amaro explains that it was a tactic to emotionally connect with a suspect later on benson testifies under oath that when she had bludgeoned lewis with a steel rod it had been necessary to restrain him as he had managed to get free from his handcuffs this surprises lewis who decides not to crossexamine her the following night benson and barba learn that lewis has called viva nuñez as another witness while crossexamining viva lewis gets her to admit that benson forced her and luisa to leave after pointing out that immigration and customs enforcement would take away luisa if she didnt cooperate lewis then creates reasonable doubt in regards to his nearfatal bludgeoning at the hands of benson by having an expert note that any one of the blows he received was enough to fully incapacitate him and that the rest were unnecessary immediately afterwards he requests a recess claiming fatigue due to a collapsed lung and uses a letter written by his prison doctor janice cole as support the judge grants his request the next day he crossexamines benson herself and addresses her family history and marital status as possible reasons why she would be sexually interested in him as his defense claims lewis proceeds to make many attempts at poking holes into her story and discrediting bensons testimony lewis returns to bensons false testimony that lewis had broken free from his handcuffs and attempts to intimidate benson into telling the real story but she remains steely the next day lewis who was planning on taking the stand explains that he had changed his mind claiming that the prosecution had failed to make its case and adds that he is ready for closing statements during closing statements lewis claims that benson was sexually obsessed with him that everything that had happened to her was consensual and that his nearfatal bludgeoning was an example of excessive force eventually the jury acquit him on the general assault and rape charges but convicted him of the charges of kidnapping and assault of a police officer as a result he was sentenced to the maximum penalty  years to life in prison before he left lewis gave benson one final glance four months later he experienced a seizure in prison and was wheeled towards the hospital on a stretcher with janice cole by his side beasts obsessionedit it was later revealed that the cause of lewiss seizure was spiked pastries given to him by the jury forewoman in his original trial an actress named bronwyn freed she had frequented lewiss prison believing him to have been wrongly convicted before one of the visits she prepared the pastries which contained her own antianxiety prescription drugs and gave them to lewis following his hospitalization doctors pronounced him dead when attempts to resuscitate him failed soon after he spontaneously autoresuscitated and amidst the monday morning mayhem attacked the police officer guarding him and a nurse attending to him all while unnoticed he murdered the officer by snapping his neck and afterwards stole his gun and raped and mutilated the nurse but she survived lewis then changed into the nurses clothing used it to blend in and escaped the hospital in the nurses car once he escaped he called benson now a sergeant using the nurses cellphone and told her i missed you sunshine before hanging up later on lewis invaded cole home shot and killed cole raped the eldest daughter lauren and left her bound and gagged her in a closet and abducted the youngest daughter amelia upon being found lauren reveals to the detectives that lewis had entrusted her with a message meant solely for benson and that she needed to speak to benson alone when that was granted she delivers the message tell the truth or the girl dies when lieutenant declan murphy asks her what that meant benson explains that she had perjured herself during his trial meanwhile lewis kills a man and steals his car then robs a gas station and beats the clerk unconscious soon after at police headquarters lewis calls them on the landline and insists that he speak to benson on the phone he again demanded that she make the confession soon or else he would kill amelia along with martha marron benson agrees to make the confession on live tv under the condition that amelia and marron remain alive he agrees but then violently shoves a man he passes off as marron down a flight of stairs and beats him into submission then manages to escape police again lewis kidnaps olivia again after olivia voluntarily meets him to save amelia lewiss latest escape prompts benson to make a televised confession about her perjury she declares that she had assaulted lewis out of rage rather than necessity and claimed that her admission had been made without coercion and by her own volition afterwards benson contacts lewis says that she could come rescue amelia she evades her security personnel takes a civilians car and heads to a junkyard where lewis was at there he holds her at gunpoint disarms her removes her cellphone and unstraps her police vest he then kidnaps her and transports her to amelias location a deserted and decrepit factory as they traveled to the uppermost floor where amelia was lewis taunts her he then forces her to choose between letting herself be raped or having amelia who was bound by her wrists be raped benson volunteers herself and lewis began to fondle and caress her but benson refused to submit to his sexual desires as a result he forces her to partake in a game of russian roulette lewis loads a sixchambered revolver presses the muzzle to his head and pulls the trigger only to reveal a blank he slides the gun to benson forcing her to fire the gun at her head with the threat that he would shoot her if she did not do it reluctantly she pulls the trigger revealing another blank lewis becoming excited retrieves the gun and pulls the trigger while aiming it at his own head firing yet another blank right before benson takes her turn however lewis hears helicopters and realizes that the police had found their location undeterred he taunts the detectives through a stolen walkietalkie he had stolen informing the svu of their game benson takes the revolver once more and revealed another blank lewis then takes the revolver and revealed another blank with the only chamber remaining being the loaded one lewis tells benson game over suddenly after intimidating and psychologically tormenting her with the prospect of her death he raises the gun to his head using his left hand and fired killing himself in an attempt to frame benson for his death known victimsedit

elevens have always shown author and renowned expert on footballedit lewis developed a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable experts on the game in  lewis wrote one of the first books on american football a primer of college football published by harper  brothers and serialized by harpers weekly upon the books release one reviewer noted a new feature hitherto inadequately treated by previous authors is the exhaustive treatment of fundamentals or the rudiments of the game such as passing catching dropping upon the ball kicking blocking making holes breaking through and tackling there is also a treatise on avoiding injuries  there are scientific expositions of team play offensive and defensive and a supplementary chapter on training which will be useful in a  article the philadelphia inquirer placed lewis on par with the legendary walter camp in his knowledge of the game writing the one man whom harvard has to match mr camp in football experience and general knowledge is william h lewis the famous harvard centre of the early nineties and the man who is the recognized authority on defense in football the country over in  critics of football sought to ban it from college campuses or to alter its rules to control its violent nature lewis published an editorial in which he wrote there is nothing the matter with football  the game itself is one of the finest sports ever devised for the pastime of youth and the pleasure of the public while opposing unnecessary roughness lewis argued against proposed changes noting that he did not want to watch a game of pingpong or marbles upon the football field lewis asserted that football should remain a strenuous competition a scientific game played according to the rules of the game with vigor and force sincerity and earnestness lewis later recalled there is no game like football  if it hadnt been for football there is no telling what i would be today  it gives you a general hardening and training

entered politics by successfully running for election to the cambridge common council where he served from  he also was elected to the massachusetts legislature in  for a single term the last african american elected to that body for decades as a result of his harvard football career lewis became a friend of president theodore roosevelt a harvard alumnus and was a guest of roosevelts at his estate at oyster bay new york in  in  the united states attorney for boston henry p moulton at the direction of roosevelt appointed lewis as an assistant united states attorney in boston he was the first african american to be an assistant us attorney his appointment was reported in newspapers across the country some wrote that the appointment was an effort by roosevelt to show that his championing of the negro is not political and is not limited to the southern states the new york times downplayed lewis race noting lewis is said to be so light in color that only his intimate friends know him to be a negro some wrote that roosevelt appointed lewis in order to keep him in boston where he could continue coaching the harvard football team the author noted that lewis owes his appointment to the fact that he is an uncommonly good football coach and that president roosevelt is a harvard man cornell has made several attempts to hire lewis as its football coach according to the story harvard men were unwilling to lose lewiss services in the football season and they undertook to make his residence here so profitable that he would remain first africanamerican assistant attorney generaledit in october  president william howard taft announced he would appoint lewis as an united states assistant attorney general sparking a national debate a north carolina newspaper wrote that the lucky colored man would hold the highest public office ever held by one of his race the appointment was reported to be the highest office in an executive branch of the government ever held by a member of that race the boston journal wrote that lewis had received the highest honor of the kind ever paid to a negro such that he then ranked in a position of credit and influence second only to that occupied by booker t washington” the washington evening star concluded that the appointment of lewis to a higher governmental position than any heretofore given to a colored man would result in a confirmation battle with southern democrats an illinois paper mistakenly reported in december  that opposition to lewis was so strong that taft had decided not to place his appointment before the senate but taft did not withdraw the nomination and a georgia newspaper predicted a hard fight is coming on the nomination many southern members are firmly resolved that lewis shall never be elevated to the high post of one of the five assistant attorneys general the position carries with it a handsome salary high social position and an entrée to white house functions whether or not lewis would ever avail himself of these privileges a number of southern democrats feel that they do not want to be a party to elevating him to an eminence where such recognition would be his as a matter of official right after a twomonth fight against him waged by the southern democratic block southern states had disfranchised most blacks at the turn of the century and white democrats dominated southern politics the senate confirmed lewis as an assistant attorney general in june  after being sworn into office lewis went to the white house where he personally thanked president taft for the high honor lewis initial assignment was to defend the federal government against all indian land claims lewis was a frequent caller at the white house and regularly attended white house functions during the taft administration challenge from southern aba membersedit attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to all  members of the aba after the ouster of lewis in  lewis was among the first african americans to be admitted to the american bar association aba in september  lewis faced a campaign for his ouster from the aba though there was no racial restriction in the organizations charter some members threatened to resign if lewis stayed when lewis name had been submitted with others by the massachusetts bar association his race had not been disclosed the southern white delegates said they did not know he was a negro until he entered the convention hall lewis refused to resign when the abas executive committee voted to oust lewis in early  us attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to each of the  members of the aba condemning the decision while northern newspapers congratulated lewis and wickersham for their stance a north carolina newspaper criticized lewis for his lack of good manners in refusing to resign the insistence of william h lewis of boston now an assistant attorney general that he retain his membership in the american bar association notwithstanding objections is due condemnation upon other grounds than those of race he would probably not have been elected if it had been known by the majority of delegate who he was having thus slipped into an organization he should offer his resignation pending a real decision of the matter this is simply what any one elected to any manner of organization through any sort of ignorance or misapprehension is required by good manners to do lewis became an advocate for african americans in the legal profession during the fight over his removal from the aba lewis published an article saying that many white men know intimately only the depraved ignorant vicious negros – those who helped to keep the dockets filled he called for blacks to train and form an army of negro lawyers of strong hearts cool heads and sane judgment to help the large number of african americans who were exploited swindled and misused private law practiceedit lewiss tenure as assistant attorney general ended with tafts presidency in  as these are political appointee positions tied to particular administrations taft recommended lewis for appointment as a massachusetts superior court judge but the states governor eugene foss declined to make the appointment lewis returned to massachusetts and entered the private practice of law he developed a reputation as an outstanding trial lawyer and appeared before the united states supreme court on more than a dozen occasions he remained active in republican politics while practicing law among his cases he represented persons accused of bootlegging and corruption in addition to those challenging racial discrimination civil rights leader and speakeredit lewis was a speaker at bostons memorial for famed abolitionist julia ward howe throughout his career lewis was outspoken on issues of race and discrimination after a white barber in cambridge refused to shave lewis he filed a suit seeking  in damages and successfully lobbied for the passage of a massachusetts law prohibiting racial discrimination in places of public accommodation in  lewis delivered an address on race relations to a gathering of amherst college alumni lewis called race the transcendent problem facing the country referring to the recent spanish–american war the disfranchisement of blacks in the south by new state constitutions and the imposition of jim crow which deprived blacks of civil rights in his remarks yesterday the united states waged a war for humanity when tyranny and oppression had grown intolerable … only a few hundreds of miles south of us are  people who are deprived of their rights who are practically in a state of serfdom thousands of them have been lynched and shot for attempting to exercise the god given rights of every human being the great democratic party rolls on its honied tongue the sweet morsels of consent of the governed and equality of man the republican party progressive patriotic absorbed with expansion is too busy to disturb the harmony of the spheres they stand opposite making grimaces at each other one says filipino the other hasnt the courage to say nigger it is a beautiful game of football with the negro as the football he delivered the commencement address to the tuskegee normal and industrial institute class of  in alabama urging them despite adversity to maintain their love for the south love your native southland nine tenths of our people were born here all our past is here all our future is here here most of us will live and here pass to the great majority and be gathered to the ashes of our fathers the most glorious history of our race is here in the southland the most glorious history of the negro race anywhere in the world is here if we have suffered here we have also achieved greatly here rejoice in everything southern” while serving as assistant attorney general lewis learned that a young africanamerican graduate of harvard had been refused employment at a prominent

credit for the great defensive strength harvard elevens have always shown author and renowned expert on footballedit lewis developed a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable experts on the game in  lewis wrote one of the first books on american football a primer of college football published by harper  brothers and serialized by harpers weekly upon the books release one reviewer noted a new feature hitherto inadequately treated by previous authors is the exhaustive treatment of fundamentals or the rudiments of the game such as passing catching dropping upon the ball kicking blocking making holes breaking through and tackling there is also a treatise on avoiding injuries  there are scientific expositions of team play offensive and defensive and a supplementary chapter on training which will be useful in a  article the philadelphia inquirer placed lewis on par with the legendary walter camp in his knowledge of the game writing the one man whom harvard has to match mr camp in football experience and general knowledge is william h lewis the famous harvard centre of the early nineties and the man who is the recognized authority on defense in football the country over in  critics of football sought to ban it from college campuses or to alter its rules to control its violent nature lewis published an editorial in which he wrote there is nothing the matter with football  the game itself is one of the finest sports ever devised for the pastime of youth and the pleasure of the public while opposing unnecessary roughness lewis argued against proposed changes noting that he did not want to watch a game of pingpong or marbles upon the football field lewis asserted that football should remain a strenuous competition a scientific game played according to the rules of the game with vigor and force sincerity and earnestness lewis later recalled there is no game like football  if it hadnt been for football there is no telling what i would be today  it gives you a general hardening and training which stands a man in good use in later life politician and lawyeredit president theodore roosevelt a friend of lewis and a harvard football fan appointed lewis as an asst us attorney in  lewis entered politics by successfully running for election to the cambridge common council where he served from  he also was elected to the massachusetts legislature in  for a single term the last african american elected to that body for decades as a result of his harvard football career lewis became a friend of president theodore roosevelt a harvard alumnus and was a guest of roosevelts at his estate at oyster bay new york in  in  the united states attorney for boston henry p moulton at the direction of roosevelt appointed lewis as an assistant united states attorney in boston he was the first african american to be an assistant us attorney his appointment was reported in newspapers across the country some wrote that the appointment was an effort by roosevelt to show that his championing of the negro is not political and is not limited to the southern states the new york times downplayed lewis race noting lewis is said to be so light in color that only his intimate friends know him to be a negro some wrote that roosevelt appointed lewis in order to keep him in boston where he could continue coaching the harvard football team the author noted that lewis owes his appointment to the fact that he is an uncommonly good football coach and that president roosevelt is a harvard man cornell has made several attempts to hire lewis as its football coach according to the story harvard men were unwilling to lose lewiss services in the football season and they undertook to make his residence here so profitable that he would remain first africanamerican assistant attorney generaledit in october  president william howard taft announced he would appoint lewis as an united states assistant attorney general sparking a national debate a north carolina newspaper wrote that the lucky colored man would hold the highest public office ever held by one of his race the appointment was reported to be the highest office in an executive branch of the government ever held by a member of that race the boston journal wrote that lewis had received the highest honor of the kind ever paid to a negro such that he then ranked in a position of credit and influence second only to that occupied by booker t washington” the washington evening star concluded that the appointment of lewis to a higher governmental position than any heretofore given to a colored man would result in a confirmation battle with southern democrats an illinois paper mistakenly reported in december  that opposition to lewis was so strong that taft had decided not to place his appointment before the senate but taft did not withdraw the nomination and a georgia newspaper predicted a hard fight is coming on the nomination many southern members are firmly resolved that lewis shall never be elevated to the high post of one of the five assistant attorneys general the position carries with it a handsome salary high social position and an entrée to white house functions whether or not lewis would ever avail himself of these privileges a number of southern democrats feel that they do not want to be a party to elevating him to an eminence where such recognition would be his as a matter of official right after a twomonth fight against him waged by the southern democratic block southern states had disfranchised most blacks at the turn of the century and white democrats dominated southern politics the senate confirmed lewis as an assistant attorney general in june  after being sworn into office lewis went to the white house where he personally thanked president taft for the high honor lewis initial assignment was to defend the federal government against all indian land claims lewis was a frequent caller at the white house and regularly attended white house functions during the taft administration challenge from southern aba membersedit attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to all  members of the aba after the ouster of lewis in  lewis was among the first african americans to be admitted to the american bar association aba in september  lewis faced a campaign for his ouster from the aba though there was no racial restriction in the organizations charter some members threatened to resign if lewis stayed when lewis name had been submitted with others by the massachusetts bar association his race had not been disclosed the southern white delegates said they did not know he was a negro until he entered the convention hall lewis refused to resign when the abas executive committee voted to oust lewis in early  us attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to each of the  members of the aba condemning the decision while northern newspapers congratulated lewis and wickersham for their stance a north carolina newspaper criticized lewis for his lack of good manners in refusing to resign the insistence of william h lewis of boston now an assistant attorney general that he retain his membership in the american bar association notwithstanding objections is due condemnation upon other grounds than those of race he would probably not have been elected if it had been known by the majority of delegate who he was having thus slipped into an organization he should offer his resignation pending a real decision of the matter this is simply what any one elected to any manner of organization through any sort of ignorance or misapprehension is required by good manners to do lewis became an advocate for african americans in the legal profession during the fight over his removal from the aba lewis published an article saying that many white men know intimately only the depraved ignorant vicious negros – those who helped to keep the dockets filled he called for blacks to train and form an army of negro lawyers of strong hearts cool heads and sane judgment to help the large number of african americans who were exploited swindled and misused private law practiceedit lewiss tenure as assistant attorney general ended with tafts presidency in  as these are political appointee positions tied to particular administrations taft recommended lewis for appointment as a massachusetts superior court judge but the states governor eugene foss declined to make the appointment lewis returned to massachusetts and entered the private practice of law he developed a reputation as an outstanding trial lawyer and appeared before the united states supreme court on more than a dozen occasions he remained active in republican politics while practicing law among his cases he represented persons accused of bootlegging and corruption in addition to those challenging racial discrimination civil rights leader and speakeredit lewis was a speaker at bostons memorial

in damages and successfully lobbied for the passage of a massachusetts law prohibiting racial discrimination in places of public accommodation in  lewis delivered an address on race relations to a gathering of amherst college alumni lewis called race the transcendent problem facing the country referring to the recent spanish–american war the disfranchisement of blacks in the south by new state constitutions and the imposition of jim crow which deprived blacks of civil rights in his remarks yesterday the united states waged a war for humanity when tyranny and oppression had grown intolerable … only a few hundreds of miles south of us are  people who are deprived of their rights who are practically in a state of serfdom thousands of them have been lynched and shot for attempting to exercise the god given rights of every human being the great democratic party rolls on its honied tongue the sweet morsels of consent of the governed and equality of man the republican party progressive patriotic absorbed with expansion is too busy to disturb the harmony of the spheres they stand opposite making grimaces at each other one says filipino the other hasnt the courage to say nigger it is a beautiful game of football with the negro as the football he delivered the commencement address to the tuskegee normal and industrial institute class of  in alabama urging them despite adversity to maintain their love for the south love your native southland nine tenths of our people were born here all our past is here all our future is here here most of us will live and here pass

also played football for amherst for three seasons in december  the amherst team voted almost unanimously to elect lewis as the team captain for his senior year  he was also the class orator and the winner of prizes for oratory and debating w e b du bois went to the amherst commencement ceremony to see lewis and another africanamerican student george w forbes receive their diplomas allamerican center at harvardedit lewis cropped from  harvard football team photograph after graduating from amherst lewis enrolled at harvard law school he played two years for the harvard football team at the center position an article published by the college football hall of fame noted that while lewis was relatively light for the position  pounds he played with intelligence quickness and maturity he was named as the center on the college football allamerica team in both years at harvard he was the first african american to be honored as an allamerican on one occasion when lewis and the harvard team entered a dining hall the princeton university football team which had many southerners rose as a group and exited in objection to the negro player in november  harvards team captain was unable to play in the last game of the season due to an injury the game was lewis last college football game and the team voted him as the acting captain for the game making him harvards first africanamerican team captain in announcing the allamerica selections for harpers weekly caspar whitney wrote that lewis has proved himself to be not only the best centre in football this year but the best allround centre that has ever put on a football jacket in  walter camp named lewis to his alltime all america team noting that lewiss quickness had revolutionized center play placing the emphasis on mobility rather than fixed stability honorsedit in  lewis was inducted into the virginia sports hall of fame in  he was elected to the college football hall of fame football coach at harvardedit following law school lewis was hired as a football coach at harvard where he served from  to  during his coaching tenure the team had a combined record of –– the boston journal wrote that lewis was owed much of the credit for the great defensive strength harvard elevens have always shown author and renowned expert on footballedit lewis developed a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable experts on the game in  lewis wrote one of the first books on american football a primer of college football published by harper  brothers and serialized by harpers weekly upon the books release one reviewer noted a new feature hitherto inadequately treated by previous authors is the exhaustive treatment of fundamentals or the rudiments of the game such as passing catching dropping upon the ball kicking blocking making holes breaking through and tackling there is also a treatise on avoiding injuries  there are scientific expositions of team play offensive and defensive and a supplementary chapter on training which will be useful in a  article the philadelphia inquirer placed lewis on par with the legendary walter camp in his knowledge of the game writing the one man whom harvard has to match mr camp in football experience and general knowledge is william h lewis the famous harvard centre of the early nineties and the man who is the recognized authority on defense in football the country over in  critics of football sought to ban it from college campuses or to alter its rules to control its violent nature lewis published an editorial in which he wrote there is nothing the matter with football  the game itself is one of the finest sports ever devised for the pastime of youth and the pleasure of the public while opposing unnecessary roughness lewis argued against proposed changes noting that he did not want to watch a game of pingpong or marbles upon the football field lewis asserted that football should remain a strenuous competition a scientific game played according to the rules of the game with vigor and force sincerity and earnestness lewis later recalled there is no game like football  if it hadnt been for football there is no telling what i would be today  it gives you a general hardening and training which stands a man in good use in later life politician and lawyeredit president theodore roosevelt a friend of lewis and a harvard football fan appointed lewis as an asst us attorney in  lewis entered politics by successfully running for election to the cambridge common council where he served from  he also was elected to the massachusetts legislature in  for a single term the last african american elected to that body for decades as a result of his harvard football career lewis became a friend of president theodore roosevelt a harvard alumnus and was a guest of roosevelts at his estate at oyster bay new york in  in  the united states attorney for boston henry p moulton at the direction of roosevelt appointed lewis as an assistant united states attorney in boston he was the first african american to be an assistant us attorney his appointment was reported in newspapers across the country some wrote that the appointment was an effort by roosevelt to show that his championing of the negro is not political and is not limited to the southern states the new york times downplayed lewis race noting lewis is said to be so light in color that only his intimate friends know him to be a negro some wrote that roosevelt appointed lewis in order to keep him in boston where he could continue coaching the harvard football team the author noted that lewis owes his appointment to the fact that he is an uncommonly good football coach and that president roosevelt is a harvard man cornell has made several attempts to hire lewis as its football coach according to the story harvard men were unwilling to lose lewiss services in the football season and they undertook to make his residence here so profitable that he would remain first africanamerican assistant attorney generaledit in october  president william howard taft announced he would appoint lewis as an united states assistant attorney general sparking a national debate a north carolina newspaper wrote that the lucky colored man would hold the highest public office ever held by one of his race the appointment was reported to be the highest office in an executive branch of the government ever held by a member of that race the boston journal wrote that lewis had received the highest honor of the kind ever paid to a negro such that he then ranked in a position of credit and influence second only to that occupied by booker t washington” the washington evening star concluded that the appointment of lewis to a higher governmental position than any heretofore given to a colored man would result in a confirmation battle with southern democrats an illinois paper mistakenly reported in december  that opposition to lewis was so strong that taft had decided not to place his appointment before the senate but taft did not withdraw the nomination and a georgia newspaper predicted a hard fight is coming on the nomination many southern members are firmly resolved that lewis shall never be elevated to the high post of one of the five assistant attorneys general the position carries with it a handsome salary high social position and an entrée to white house functions whether or not lewis would ever avail himself of these privileges a number of southern democrats feel that they do not want to be a party to elevating him to an eminence where such recognition would be his as a matter of official right after a twomonth fight against him waged by the southern democratic block southern states had disfranchised most blacks at the turn of the century and white democrats dominated southern politics the senate confirmed lewis as an assistant attorney general in june  after being sworn into office lewis went to the white house where he personally thanked president taft for the high honor lewis initial assignment was to defend the federal government against all indian land claims lewis was a frequent caller at the white house and regularly attended white house functions during the taft administration challenge from southern aba membersedit attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to all  members of the aba after the ouster of lewis in  lewis was among the first african americans to be admitted to the american bar association aba in september  lewis faced a campaign for his ouster from the aba though there was no racial restriction in the organizations charter some members threatened to resign if lewis stayed when lewis name had been submitted with others by the massachusetts bar association his race had not been disclosed the southern white delegates said they did not know he was a negro until he entered the convention hall lewis refused to resign when the abas executive committee voted to oust lewis in early  us attorney general george w wickersham sent a spirited letter to each of the  members of the aba condemning the decision while northern newspapers congratulated lewis and wickersham for their stance a north carolina newspaper criticized lewis for his lack of good manners in refusing to resign the insistence of william h lewis of boston now an assistant attorney general that he retain his membership in the american bar association notwithstanding objections is due condemnation upon other grounds than those of race he would probably not have been elected if it had been known by the majority of delegate who he was having thus slipped into an organization he should offer his resignation pending a real decision of the matter this is simply what any one elected to any manner of organization through any sort of ignorance or misapprehension is required by good manners to do lewis became an advocate for african americans in the legal profession during the fight over his removal from the aba lewis published an article saying that many white men know intimately only the depraved ignorant vicious negros – those who helped to keep the dockets filled he called for blacks to train and form an army of negro lawyers of strong hearts cool heads and sane judgment to help the large number of african americans who were exploited swindled and misused private law practiceedit lewiss tenure as assistant attorney general ended with tafts presidency in  as these are political appointee positions tied to particular administrations taft recommended lewis for appointment as a massachusetts superior court judge but the states governor eugene foss declined to make the appointment lewis returned to massachusetts and entered the private practice of law he developed a reputation as an outstanding trial lawyer and appeared before the united states supreme court on more than a dozen occasions he remained active in republican politics while practicing law among his cases he represented persons accused of bootlegging and corruption in addition to those challenging racial discrimination civil rights leader and speakeredit lewis was a speaker at bostons memorial for famed abolitionist julia ward howe throughout his career lewis was outspoken on issues of race and discrimination after a white barber in cambridge refused to shave lewis he filed a suit seeking  in damages and successfully lobbied for the passage of a massachusetts law prohibiting racial discrimination in places of public accommodation in  lewis delivered an address on race relations to a gathering of amherst college alumni lewis called race the transcendent problem facing the country referring to the recent spanish–american war the disfranchisement of blacks in the south by new state constitutions and the imposition of jim crow which deprived blacks of civil rights in his remarks yesterday the united states waged a war for humanity when tyranny and oppression had grown intolerable … only a few hundreds of miles south of us are  people who are deprived of their rights who are practically in a state of serfdom thousands of them have been lynched and shot for attempting to exercise the god given rights of every human being the great democratic party rolls on its honied tongue the sweet morsels of consent of the governed and equality of man the republican party progressive patriotic absorbed with expansion is too busy to disturb the harmony of the spheres they stand opposite making grimaces at each other one says filipino the other hasnt the courage to say nigger it is a beautiful game of football with the negro as the football he delivered the commencement address to the tuskegee normal and industrial institute class of  in alabama urging them despite adversity to maintain their love for the south love your native southland nine tenths of our people were born here all our past is here all our future is here here most of us will live and here pass to the great majority and be gathered to the ashes of our fathers the most glorious history of our race is here in the southland the most glorious history of the negro race anywhere in the world is here if we have suffered here we have also achieved greatly here rejoice in everything southern” while serving as assistant attorney general lewis learned that a young africanamerican graduate of harvard had been refused employment at a prominent boston trust company on account of race in a speech to boston business leaders lewis said in boston the outlook for the negro is far worse than it has been since the civil war i think the blood of three signers of the declaration of independence and of the abolitionists has run out he noted that if he owned the majority of stock in a certain trust company he would force the company to hire the blackest man in boston lewis speech reportedly drew volumes of cheers from the businessmen and also from the colored waiters who cheered frequently lewis was one of three persons invited to deliver an address at bostons symphony hall memorial to abolitionist julia ward howe following her death in  in  lewis was one of the signatories to a call published in the new york herald for a national conference on lynching intended to take concerted action against the widespread practice of lynching and lawlessness in primarily southern states lynching had reached what is now seen as a peak in the south around the turn of the century the period when those states imposed white supremacy in the summer of  after lewis speech the economic and social tensions of the postwar years erupted in numerous white racial attacks against blacks in northern and midwestern cities where blacks had migrated by the thousands and were competing with recent european immigrants it was called red summer deathedit lewis died in boston of heart failure on january   he was interred at mount auburn cemetery in cambridge massachusetts referencesedit  a b
