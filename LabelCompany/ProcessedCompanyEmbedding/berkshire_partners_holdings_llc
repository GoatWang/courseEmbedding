investing in growth companies and working closely with their management teams to realize the full potential of each business  for over  years we have worked together to pursue this goal  since our founding we have built a culture of shared governance and collective decisionmaking that we view as distinctive in our industry  this philosophy of collaboration has been a key element in our ability to attract and retain professionals who bring relevant experience and perspectives to our firm as a firm we have made over  investments in companies beginning in  with our investment in carlin foods  over the years we have established deep knowledge and relationships in industries such as consumer products and retail business services industrials transportation and communications  our investment mandate has been flexible throughout allowing us to create value in many ways from helping to build a leading wireless tower provider like crown castle and privatizing railroad systems in the united kingdom through english welsh  scottish rail to supporting significant growth in the cosmetics industry with bare escentuals  while we are more likely to seek investments in our core areas of expertise we remain opportunistic and regularly consider investments in a variety of sectorswe believe that alignment of interests is essential in fostering a constructive relationship with each company in our portfolio and with our investors  in both cases the fact that individuals at berkshire comprise the firm’s largest investor group makes our commitment to work together with management and on behalf of our investors very clear  by producing strong results at our portfolio companies we help our management partners our investors and ourselves achieve success  furthermore we are grateful to have investors who support longterm equity value creation which enables us to maintain our focus on building enduring value within each companyfor our first  years we focused solely on investing through our private equity funds  in  we expanded our activities by launching stockbridge our fund that invests in marketable securities  we saw this new initiative as a way of leveraging the skills relationships and—we hope—wisdom that we have accumulated in the private equity world while creating another opportunity to provide value to our investors today stockbridge has over  billion under management with leading institutions and select individuals investing alongside our team  we take pride in the collaborative culture we have built across our firm  our investment process continues to be one based upon analytical rigor and consensusbased decisionmaking  within private equity we actively engage with our portfolio companies to identify key strategic priorities and implement necessary operational improvements  stockbridge similarly values the wisdom of the team and the importance of deep research and has devoted considerable resources behind this goal we draw on strong analytical skills of the collective team our wealth of contacts built over  years as well as experience derived from investing over multiple economic cycles to support the management teams of the companies in which we have invested  together we work hard to position our companies for longterm success    berkshire factstotal private equity investments made yearsaverage tenure of managing
