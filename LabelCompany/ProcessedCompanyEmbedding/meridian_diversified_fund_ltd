to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings

strategies the fund seeks longterm growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded common stocks of us companies under normal circumstances the fund emphasizes stocks which the investment adviser believes are undervalued in relation to an issuer’s longterm earnings power or asset value or the stock market in general securities in which the fund invests may be undervalued because of many factors including market decline poor economic conditions taxloss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the issuer of the security the fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries the fund intends to invest at least  of its total assets in common stocks and equityrelated securities such as convertible debt securities and warrants the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt or fixed income securities including higher yield higher risk lower rated or unrated corporate bonds commonly referred to as “junk bonds” these are bonds that are rated ba or below by moody’s or bb or below by sp the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in securities rated ca or below by moody’s or c or below by sp or unrated but considered by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets calculated at the time of purchase in securities of foreign companies including emerging market companies if in the invest ment adviser’s opinion a stock has reached a fully valued position it generally will be but need not be sold and replaced by securities which are deemed to be undervalued in the marketplace the fund generally sells investments when i the investment adviser concludes that the company’s fundamentals are not meeting expectations ii better investment opportunities exist andor iii the company’s business has improved and this in the investment adviser’s opinion is reflected in the share priceprincipal investment risks there are risks involved with any investment the principal risks associated with an investment in this fund are set forth below please see the section “further information about principal risks” in this prospectus for a detailed discussion of these risks and other factors you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the fund general risk — you could lose money on your investment in the fund or the fund could underperform other investments investment style risk — although the fund makes every effort to achieve its investment objective of longterm growth of capital it cannot guarantee that the investment adviser’s investment strategies or securities selection method will achieve that objective equity securities risk — equity securities holders are entitled to the income and increase in the value of the assets and business of an issuer after debt obligations and obligations to debt securities holders are satisfied equity securities fluctuate in price in response to many factors including historical and prospective earnings of the issuer the value of its assets general economic conditions interest rates investors perceptions and market liquidity market risk — the value of the fund’s investments will fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general stock market and economic conditions and the value of your investment in the fund may be more or less than your purchase price value investing risk — there is a risk that the fund’s emphasis on investing in valueoriented companies may underperform during times when value investing is out of favor small company risk — generally the smaller the capitalization of a company the greater the risk associated with an investment in the company the stock prices of smaller and newer companies tend to fluctuate more than those of larger more established companies and have smaller market for their shares than do large capitalization companies foreign company risk— investments in foreign securities may be subject to more risks than those associated with us investments including currency fluctuations political and economic instability and differences in accounting auditing and financial reporting standards emerging market securities involve greater risk and more volatility than those of companies in more developed markets significant levels of foreign taxes are also a risk related to foreign investments high yield bond risk — debt securities that are rated below investment grade commonly referred to as “junk bonds” involve a greater risk of default or price declines than investment grade securities the market for highyield lower rated securities may be thinner and less active causing market price volatility and limited liquidity in the secondary market this may limit the ability of a fund to sell these securities at their fair market values either to meet redemption requests or in response to changes in the economy or the financial markets debt securities risk — debt securities are subject to credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk credit risk is the risk that the entity that issued a debt security may become unable to make payments of principal and interest when due and includes the risk of default interest rate risk is the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that the fund may not be able to sell portfolio securities including medium and lowergrade securities because there are too few buyers for them quick fund finder select fund select fund meridian growth fund meridian

information important risk considerations the fund may not achieve its objective andor you could lose money on your investment in the fund stock markets and investments in individual stocks are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer market economic industry political regulatory geopolitical and other conditions investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rate environments as the underlying debt instruments in the portfolio adjust to the rise in rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price emerging markets can have less market structure depth and regulatory custodial or operational oversight and greater political social and economic instability than developed markets investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in smallcap companies can be more volatile than investments in larger companies investments in lowerquality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments real estaterelated investments can be volatile because of general regional and local economic conditions fluctuations in interest rates and property tax rates shifts in zoning laws environmental regulation and other governmental actions increased operation expenses lack of availability of mortgage funds losses due to natural disasters changes in property values and rental rates overbuilding losses due to casualty

increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no
