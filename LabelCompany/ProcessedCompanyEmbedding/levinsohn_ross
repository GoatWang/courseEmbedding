update yahoo just filed regulatory documents about the separation noting severance agreements that total many millions of dollars and the company also released a statement confirming the departure “ross has done a terrific job during his time at yahoo we wish him all the best” levinsohn also had a memo to staff which is also below levinsohn who took over as interim ceo in the wake of the ouster of scott thompson earlier this year had been running the americas unit of the silicon valley internet giant that put him in charge of key yahoo businesses including its media and advertising sales divisions levinsohn and mayer have been negotiating his exit for several days sources said which is not surprising given the awkward circumstance between them while mayer might have benefited from levinsohn’s close ties with key marketing players and his content experience her intense focus on products and not on media likely means that she will rely on a more techheavy leadership team going

gigantically lucrative advertising search deal with google that garnered myspace huge revenues after leaving news corp — after repeated clashes with myspace cofounder and then ceo chris dewolfe — he partnered with miller in another investment company velocity capital ironically both miller and levinsohn were the top choices of billionaire shareholder activist carl icahn as the execs he wanted to run yahoo when he was agitating for change there a few years back in the midst of the failed takeover attempt by microsoft fast forward several years with levinsohn losing his shot as ceo of yahoo after yet another hedge fund manager — dan loeb of third point who waged a yahoo proxy fight that ended in him getting seats on the board — strongly backed mayer for the job instead of levinsohn levinsohn never had a chance against the techstar resume of mayer of course but for his time of taking over yahoo after the crisis around the ouster of thompson over a fake computer science degree on his bio alone — a rocky period for the company to be sure — levinsohn probably deserves a lot of kudos from yahoo’s board more to come obviously but here is the mayer note about levinsohn’s departure in full subject thank you to ross levinsohn do not forward i am writing to let you know that ross levinsohn will be leaving the company at the end of july ross has been an important and powerful contributor at yahoo since he joined in  during may and june ross stepped into an incredibly tough role as interim ceo and did a terffic job — he really helped keep the company moving closed important deals and assembled a very talented team i am very grateful to ross for his leadership and work throughout his tenure at yahoo his contributions will be missed ross will be in sunnyvale tomorrow tuesday july  please take the opportunity to drop by and thank him for all he has done for the company i hope you can join me in wishing ross well and letting him know how much you’ve appreciated him as a colleague — marissa i wanted to let you know that my time at yahoo has come to an end it has been an incredible journey for me and i could not be prouder of what we accomplished over the past few years helping define yahoo as a leader in digital media and advertising yahoo is an amazing brand and company and i leave knowing we did all we could to help inform and entertain more than  million users each month leading this company has been one of the best experiences of my career but it is time for me to look for the next challenge — ross tagged with advertising agreement americas attempt

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
