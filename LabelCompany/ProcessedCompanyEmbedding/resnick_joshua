trading record january     stephen taub read more josh resnick jericho capital asset management resnick who specializes in technology media and telecom stocks has been outperforming many of the industry’s best longshort managers including the tiger cubs joshua resnick is building one of the hedge fund industry’s best longshort track records the head of new york–based jericho capital asset management which now manages close to  billion posted a net gain of  percent in  after gaining  percent the prior year that’s compared with a  percent gain for the msci world index and a  percent gain for the sp  index what’s more resnick has generated a  percent return since he launched his hedge fund in july  of course it helps that he has not had to maneuver through a bear market having launched his fund three or so months after the start of the current bull market even so resnick has been able to outperform many of the betterknown longshort managers including most of the tiger cub community — managers whose roots go back to julian robertson jr’s legendary firm tiger management corp — even though he has a fairly significant short book as well resnick’s thirdquarter letter obtained by alpha provides a glimpse into his deft stockpicking ability in that threemonth period the fund made nearly half of its profits for the year rising  percent net of fees resnick’s long portfolio generated  percent gross gains offset by a  percent loss on the short side in the fourth quarter jericho’s longs generated a gross  percent gain on an average gross long exposure of  percent however the firm said shorts cut into profits by  percent calling  the most difficult environment for shortselling since jericho’s inception resnick specializes in technology media and telecommunications stocks but he told clients in his fourthquarter letter that he made money in every major sector and in every geographical region including latin america and emerging markets in europe the middle east and africa where he notes the equity markets were lackluster the fund’s fourth quarter performance was wellbalanced as we generated gains in every major region and in each industry the letter states the fund’s most profitable area in the fourth quarter was western european media no single position was a disproportionate driver of our gains in the quarter it adds resnick’s most profitable position in the third quarter was a long position in alcatellucent which he began buying in november  after what he described as a disastrous earnings miss in the third quarter of  sent the stock to an alltime low on the other hand resnick acknowledged that making money on the short side was challenging explaining what most longshort managers have been complaining about — easy money has tended to lift all boats driving the most benighted secular losers to double and triple from their lows but resnick stressed that he was sticking with his short strategy focusing on identifying companies facing idiosyncratic challenges which should be sustained regardless of the macroeconomic environment or the financing market he explains resnick graduated from emory university in  with a ba in economics after spending two years as a financial analyst at bear stearns in its media and entertainment group he worked in th century fox television’s business development group reviewing mergers acquisitions joint ventures and investments according to an article that appeared in variety in  he was involved in several highprofile deals including news corp’s  percent asset purchase of fox entertainment groupliberty media the sale of american sky broadcasting to echostar communications and the partnership between the national geographic channel and nbc according to the trade newspaper resnick went on to become a managing director of kpe ventures a nowdefunct venture capital fund that specialized in media entertainment and technology he then moved over to tcs capital management a hedge fund where he spent seven and a half years eventually rising to managing director he left in december  it is not clear where jericho made most of its money in  however according to regulatory filings resnick liquidated sizable stakes in google and tripadvisor in the third quarter so no matter when he sold during that threemonth period he stood to book huge gains on the positions he also did well with two other large holdings through at least september — mcgrawhill cos owner of standard  poor’s and casino operator melco crown entertainment jericho’s thirdquarter letter also provides a hint of where the hedge fund made money on the short side in the fourth quarter one particularly intriguing position resnick outlines is his bet against what he calls patent assertion entities more commonly known as patent trolls he explains that these companies develop or acquire patents and then try to monetize them through settlements and licensing agreements often by threatening costly litigation because paes do not make products or offer services they are exposed to neither counterinfringement suits nor reputational risk he explains hence they are wellpositioned to engage in such antagonistic tactics a record  patent suits were filed in  according to resnick who cites a study from pricewaterhousecoopers the number of suits tripled between  and  at the same time the technological revolution has spawned an explosion in the number of broadly defined patents resnick adds so where is the short opportunity resnick makes the case that regulators and markets will take action to make the pae business model untenable he asserts that all signs suggest we are rapidly approaching such a negative inflection point in the pae life cycle resnick noted that in  alone congress introduced six bills aimed at curbing pae activity backed by corporate giants such as amazoncom ebay facebook google macy’s microsoft corp and walmart stores meanwhile these days sellers of patents are starting to demand immediate outlays resnick points out adding that prices are rising rapidly as the market matures we believe the arbitrage opportunities for paes are growing increasingly scarce he adds yet he says the investment community does not understand the industry coverage is limited and the few sellside analysts that do follow paes specialize in the industries targeted by the paes and they are generally bullish on the paes’ prospects deriving their valuation estimates from historical trends and from simplistic perpatent valuation analyses resnick asserts few on the sellside have considered whether the pae business model is sustainable he adds resnick then makes the case that six pae companies that accounted for a combined  billion in equity value at the time have little if any underlying value in their businesses the companies are acacia research corp interdigital rambus rpx corp tessera and vringo sure enough in the fourth quarter alone two of the stocks tanked — acacia fell  percent and interdigital fell  percent — while the other four were either flat or slightly up or down most read morning brief dan loeb’s third point moves away from trump trade hedge fund  firm profiles
