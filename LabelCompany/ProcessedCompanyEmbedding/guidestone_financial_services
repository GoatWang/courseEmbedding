widows guidestone is one of the largest faithbased entities to offer financial services for church and denominational workers formerly known to southern baptists as the annuity board of the southern baptist convention guidestone’s mission to support aging ministers and their widows and orphans began with a  gift from the sunday school board now lifeway christian resources and a nearly  gift from john d rockefeller and his son the stated mission of guidestone financial resources is “to assist churches denominational entities and other evangelical ministry organizations by making available retirement plan services life and health coverage risk management programs and personal and institutional investment programs” founded in an era when many churches and christian organizations provided little retirement or insurance support for their staff guidestone provided vital services to leaders and staff of local churches and convention ministries giving them peace of mind to concentrate on the great commission as they reach out to their communities with the gospel matthew   timothy  guidestone also supports the great commission by its sponsorship of the “widow’s might” ministry this ministry encourages widows to pray for southern baptist ministries worldwide—especially in the area of evangelism as the guidestone website reflects this ministry encourages prayer for regular ongoing ministry needs as well as specific prayer requests that are posted on a quarterly basis unlike many southern baptist entities that are supported by the cooperative program guidestone financial resources receives no funding from the southern baptist convention cooperative program allocation budget it is supported by the fees earned on its services and the growth of its investments in  guidestone voluntarily stopped receiving cooperative program funds in order to release those funds to enhance the spread of the gospel through other sbc ministries prior to then  percent of the cooperative program funds received by guidestone was used to support its missiondignity ministry that provides relief support for retired pastors denominational workers and their widows who live in financial need formerly called “adopt an annuitant” guidestone’s missiondignity provides assistance for approximately two thousand retired ministers denominational workers or their widows living on meager incomes many of these individuals once served small often rural churches which were unable to provide retirement support for them during their years of ministry operating largely by donations
