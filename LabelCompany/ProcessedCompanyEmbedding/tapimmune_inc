microcapresearchcom – researching the best microcap stocks researching the best microcap stocks tapimmune inc tpivd expected nasdaq uplisting pending with multiple phase ii oncology products posted on september   by gary anderson   reply q what do you get when a biotech company is days away from uplisting to the nasdaq capital market has recently obtained funding to proceed in not one not two but four phase ii clinical trials with an oncology emphasis and has collaborative partnerships with astrazeneca azn memorial sloan kettering cancer center and mayo clinic  a a stock primed for a major move the company is tapimmune inc and the stock is tpivd tapimmune inc web site is a clinicalstage immuneoncology company specializing in the development of innovative technologies for the treatment of cancer and metastatic disease the company has made considerable clinical and financial progress over the last year including the completion of positive phase i clinical trials in breast and ovarian cancer at the mayo clinic which showed that its tpv and tpv vaccines were safe and well tolerated and demonstrated robust cellular immune responses in over  of evaluable patients since the results tpiv has announced multiple phase  clinical studies – and was also granted an orphan drug designation and received fast track designation from the fda for tpiv  in ovarian cancer with a  million grant the us department of defense is fully funding a doubleblinded placebo controlled phase ii study of tpiv  in  patients with triple negative breast cancer to be conducted at the mayo clinic in jacksonville florida emphasis mine shares outstanding  million closing price   market cap  million nasdaq uplist pending as announced last week tapimmune believes that it now meets the requirements for listing the company’s common stock on the nasdaq capital market a number of tapimmune investors recently exercised a total of  million warrants resulting in a  million cash infusion additionally tapimmune closed on a  million financing through a private equity placement while certain outstanding warrants were restructured eliminating  million of derivative liability these actions successfully bolstered the company’s balance sheet to meet nasdaq capital market listing requirements while a reverse stock split last week brought the share price above the nasdaq listing minimum to be listed on the nasdaq capital market requirements include an operating history of  years  million in shareholders equity  million publicly held shares and a bid price of  according to the nasdaq initial listing guide page  having invested in many uplisting stocks over the years i can tell you there is no grey area in this process…you either meet the requirements or you do not and tapimmune now meets them the listing will open up a huge market of institutional investors that could not previously invest in tapimmune a company with four phase ii clinical trials of drugs for ovarian and breast cancer one with fast track designation and orphan drug status that has collaborative partnerships with astrazeneca mayo clinic memorial sloan kettering cancer center as you read more below it will become clear the current market cap  million does not come anywhere close to reflecting the underlying value of tpivd that will change with the nasdaq listing and the resulting increased awareness of tapimmune’s world class partnerships and attractive drug pipeline by analysts and institutional investors active pipeline multiple phase ii trials  tapimune’s chairman and ceo glynn wilson phd stated earlier this month “recent events have been transformative for tapimmune we believe we are now funded to execute on the  phase  clinical trials for our lead cancer vaccine tpiv  two of which have already started treating patients with two more trials slated to commence enrollment in the coming few quarters” and “we believe the phase  data produced for both tpiv  and tpiv  in collaboration with the mayo clinic are the driving force behind the highvalue collaborations we have been able to maintain and establish with organizations including mayo clinic astrazeneca sloan kettering and the us department of defense as we move forward into advancing the phase  studies some of which are represent collaboration with prestigious third party organizations we believe this represents further independent vetting of potential of our technology”       “fully funded to execute on the  phase ii clinical trials”    phase ii trial of tpiv  for triple negative breast cancer about  of breast cancers are found to be triplenegative meaning the breast cancer cells tested negative for estrogen receptors progesterone receptors and her this breast cancer does not respond to hormonal therapy such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors or therapies that target her receptors such as herceptin chemical name trastuzumab for doctors and researchers there is intense interest in finding new medications that can treat this kind of breast cancer tapimmune has opened  clinical sites and is currently treating patients in a phase  trial of the company’s folate receptor alpha cancer vaccine tpiv  in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer one of the most difficult to treat cancers representing a clear unmet medical need the openlabel  patient clinical trial is designed to evaluate dosing regimens adjuvants efficacy and immune responses in women with triple negative breast cancer key data from the trial is expected to be included in a future new drug application submission to the fda for marketing clearance phase ii trial at memorial sloan kettering of tpiv  in ovarian cancer in collaboration with astrazeneca a phase ii study of tpiv  in ovarian cancer patients who are not responsive to platinum a commonly used chemotherapy for ovarian cancer sponsored by memorial sloan kettering cancer center and in collaboration with astrazeneca tapimmune has begun enrollment for a  patient study the openlabel study is designed to evaluate a combination therapy which includes tapimmune’s tpiv  tcell vaccine and astrazeneca’s checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab because they are unresponsive to platinum these patients have no real options left if the combination therapy proves effective it would address a critical unmet need tpiv  has received orphan drug designation for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer multiple near term positive drivers in addition to nasdaq uplisting   i love stocks with multiple near term positive drivers…and tapimmune has them enrollment to commence in q  phase ii mayo clinicus dod trial of tpiv  in triple negative breast cancer tapimmune anticipates that this phase  study of tpiv  in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer conducted by the mayo clinic and sponsored by the us department of defense dod will begin to enroll patients in the fourth quarter of this year the anticipated  patient study will be led by dr keith knutson of the mayo clinic in jacksonville florida dr knutson is the inventor of the technology and an advisor to tapimmune while tapimmune is supplying doses of tpiv  for the trial the remaining costs associated with conducting this study will be funded by a  million grant made by the dod to the mayo clinic clinical sites to open in q  phase ii tpiv  trial in platinumsensitive ovarian cancer fast tracked by fda by the end of  tapimmune expects to have at least one clinical site open in a phase ii trial of tpiv  in  ovarian cancer patients who are responsive to platinum tpivd received the fda’s fast track designation to develop tpiv  as a maintenance therapy in combination with platinum in platinum responsive ovarian cancer this multicenter doubleblind efficacy study is sponsored and conducted by tapimmunedr glynn wilson chairman and ceo of tapimmune states “we believe that the fda’s decision to grant fast track designation to tpiv  for the treatment ovarian cancer significantly expedites our clinical development program we look forward to starting phase ii trials in the near future to address this highly aggressive cancer we believe tpiv  has the potential to improve outcomes for ovarian cancer patients for whom current treatment modalities offer a relative short time to recurrence and a poor overall prognosis” open ind investigational new drug with fda for tpiv  in q  tapimmune has reformulated a second cancer vaccine product tpiv  following very strong safety and immune responses from a phase  mayo clinic studytpiv  targets herneu which makes it applicable to breast ovarian and colorectal cancer  the reformulated product adds a fifth antigen which should produce an even more robust immune response activating both cd and cd tcells tapimmune has already requested a preinvestigational new drug ind meeting with the fda and submitted questions to the fda related to opening the ind a response from the fda is expected in september and tapimmune anticipates having an open ind by yearend pending comments from fda   preclinical pipeline expands tapimmune’s breast  ovarian cancer killer therapies     also preclinical a next generation tcell vaccine polystart in february of this year tapimmune received notice of allowance on a patent for a next generation tcell vaccine called “polystart” this unique vaccine platform antigen expression system creates a  four fold or more increase in antigen presentation  the increased cell surface presentation increases activated helper andor longlived killer tcell populations that then effectively seek out and work to destroy a patient’s cancer cells the below data from a current study showing the increased presentation and subsequent killing of the targeted cell population   dr glynn wilson chairman  ceo of tapimmune explains “we are very excited about this technology as we believe it marks a next generation of tcell vaccines polystart has unlimited application in oncology and infectious diseases not only within tapimmune’s own platforms but it can be applied to many others via licensing as we move forward into phase  trials for tpiv  which targets folate receptor alpha and tpiv  our herneu product we fully expect to develop polystart as both a standalone therapy and as a ‘boost strategy’ to be used synergistically with our peptidebased vaccines for breast and ovarian cancer”  i believe polystart is the icing on the cake of this soontobediscovered nasdaq listed biotech standout conclusion tapimmune tpivd is a biotech stock that should gain solid traction with the pending nasdaq uplisting the company has  different clinical trials in phase ii for unmet needs in breast and ovarian cancers collaborations and partnerships with astrazeneca memorial sloan kettering cancer center and mayo clinic demonstrate the potential these world class organizations see in tapimmune and in the tpiv   tpiv  clinical trials going forward the company has several positive forward drivers to increase momentum and share prices following the uplisting as well investors can very reasonably expect increased retail and institutional awareness  increased volume and increasing share prices in the coming weeksmonths see also tapimmune investor presentation     disclaimerdisclosureterms of use       one thought on

already visit regularly we do not sell drugs in fact we dont sell anything right now we are focused on information only our primary mission is to make you a smarter consumer so you can make better choices when filling your prescriptions right now generic lipitor costs  at one major pharmacy chain but the exact same medication is free at a pharmacy across the street in america prescription drugs cost too much up to  of americans have trouble paying for the prescriptions they require and  of americans simply dont fill prescriptions because they simply cant afford it the  reason americans don’t take their medications as prescribed is cost even if you can afford to pay you or a combination of you your insurance company your employer andor the government are likely paying too much for your prescriptions it can cost less than  to manufacture a pill so why do we pay   or even  for meds even a  insurance copay can often be  times what the fair price of a medicine should be you probably already knew drugs were expensive but did you know prices for prescription drugs vary widely between pharmacies most americans assume that drug prices are regulated or fixed that’s simply not true prices vary wildly in drugstores that are literally across the street from each other especially when filling generic medications which make up about  of the prescription fills in america uninsured it’s easy to get a better price prices for most drugs at most pharmacies are very high for the uninsured patient however there are many ways to save  or more  coupons savings tips pharmacy discounts manufacturer discounts cheaper alternative drugs or even just asking for a better price sadly there’s never been an easy way to find these discounts and know the fair price for your drug insured your copay may not be your lowest price health insurance is great but its far from the only way to save money on your meds for example hundreds of generic medications are available for  or even free without insurance …if only you know where to go your insurance copay of  doesnt sound so great if goodrx can point you to the exact same drug for  less plus many insurance plans have high deductibles or limited formularies that dont cover the drugs you need lastly even insured patients buying covered brandname drugs would probably want to know about coupons that could save them  or more per year the price of drugs has been decreasing but you’re paying more many big brandname drugs such as lipitor lexapro and singulair have recently become available as generics when brandname drugs go generic their price rapidly decreases from potentially hundreds of dollars to as little as  however insurance companies are pushing more of the cost of drugs onto the patient  your share of the cost is now  more than just  years ago as insurance companies make you pay for your drugs your doctor may not know how much your drugs cost a doctor’s primary job is to make sure that you receive the best care not track costs drug prices change all the time pharmacies charge different prices and everyone has different insurance plans  so it’s very hard for them to know what you’ll pay but it is important that you know so that you dont leave the doctors office with a prescription that you cant or dont want to fill fortunately goodrx can help for consumers find a drug price how goodrx works goodrx mobile
