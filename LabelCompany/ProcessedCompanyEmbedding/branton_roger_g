job details mooers branton  company provides an excellent opportunity for lucrative venture capitallike gains on its successes however we operate in an aggressive industry and we strive to simultaneously minimize risks through our disciplined business model as well as by virtue of the diversification that is achieved through our specific proprietary merchant banking structure leading with our own capital generally at the riskiest stage necessitates that we diligently evaluate the soundness of each and every investment what is a merchant bank better known in parts of the world outside the united states a merchant bank is an entity that helps companies grow and prosper by providing the capital needed to reach their full potential unlike investment banks the most critical attribute of a merchant bank is to lead the investment with the banks own money at the riskiest stage and then seek additional capital to further growth once risks have been managed this is the process adopted by mooers branton  company this contrasts significantly with various models in the retailoriented commissionbased investment banking industry where incentives are all too frequently not in the right place due to factors such as other peoples money another characteristic of traditional merchant banking is a more intimate relationship between the bank and the companies it supports mooers branton  company understands that its expertise is financial not operational but it maintains close relationships with management in order to ensure that assets are protected and growth is stimulated for that reason it is careful to maintain a manageable number of companies in its portfolio the focus of a merchant bank is developing healthy companies that ultimately result in a significant return on investment profits for the bank and its investorpartners generally occur when portfolio companies are acquired or offered for public investment we are notventure capitalistsgenerally venture capitalists invest in early stage highrisk businesses often based upon unproven products at the conceptual stage and having blue sky potential ie a good story but unproven often requiring substantial funds to validate the business  or not their targeted investments usually do not incorporate less risky products or services that will hedge their potential downside losses philosophically they tend to accept that a majority of their investments will not realize the blue sky projections and will consequently fail or provide less than acceptable rates of return venture capitalists generally hope that  of their investments succeed at such high levels that satisfactory returns are achieved for the portfolio as a whole additional professional information on roger g
