jr roddy jones steve stroud and smedes york —… more marc banka i had a few hours with o temple sloan jr about five months ago when he and his real estate friends took me back in history to chronicle the rise of raleigh after all sloan who made his money and garnered his influence mostly from general parts international is also one of the largest real estate investors raleigh has ever seen enlarge pictured from left o temple sloan jr roddy jones steve stroud and smedes york —… more marc banka what struck me about this yearold quiet and proud man who started general parts back in  was his ability to shape the conversation when we started talking about general parts his son o temple sloan iii and all the financial pressures engulfing the auto parts industry sloan swiftly pivoted the conversation about how people and leadership qualities are the cornerstone of a successful manager and a profitable company nobody knows how much the sloan family would make out of this  billion deal with advance auto parts nyse aap but i am guessing it is substantial did the sloan family just become the triangle’s next billionaires if so that’s a good thing i say that by looking at what sloan has done in the past he is acutely aware of the needs of the community and as his friends and business partners steve stroud owner of nai carolantic and roddy jones founder of davidson  jones recently told me much of sloan’s good deeds are never publicized because he wants to keep it that way “in so many ways temple is a private man” jones said recently but don’t mistake being private with being apathetic or not being vocal sloan an avid reader could challenge the thinking of the mostestablished business leader so i can only imagine when wells fargo nyse wfc was doing the deal with advanced auto parts the finance guys had to be on their “a” game temple sloan jr has never shown much patience for ignorance and mediocrity there is one other thing you should know about sloan — he is not going to sit on his glory and see the days pass by he has an investment firm trail creek investments through which much of his real estate dealings take shape expect him to continue to look for deals and continue the expansion of his portfolio temple is a student of worker and customer behavior and always tries to find an edge in business because he worked that much harder than the competition i remember when we were talking he brought up the fact that one of his executives sent him a chart that looked deeper into the generational differences in the workplace the chart shows how workers from different generation baby boomers generation x millenials etc  behave and react to change work environment leadership style and money he still has a lot of gunpowder left in him i am sure we will hear about his next venture soon sloan o temple iii top holdings whalewisdom search all search f filers only search sec filer search stocks only search mgmt inv cos only etfs only search active sloan o
