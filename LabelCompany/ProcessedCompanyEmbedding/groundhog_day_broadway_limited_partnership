project might be said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of groundhog day however in a  live chat he said that to make a musical of groundhog day would be to gild the lily it cannot be improved in  during an interview with mtv news harold ramis revealed that danny rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a groundhog day musical for some time and already had about  song ideas whittled down from  along with dialog scenes and other production aspects around  rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer shortly after reaching this conclusion rubin was called by director matthew

lyrics for the adaption added our version of groundhog day is going to be both instantly recognisable and utterly different and that the central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre it has the

by the american film institute in august  stephen sondheim when asked what his next project might be said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of groundhog day however in a  live chat he said that to make a musical of groundhog day would be to gild the lily it cannot be improved in  during an interview with mtv news harold ramis revealed that danny rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a groundhog day musical for some time and already had about  song ideas whittled down from  along with dialog scenes and other production aspects around  rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer shortly after reaching this conclusion rubin was called by director matthew warchus to introduce him to tim minchin who had just finished writing the songs for matilda the musical rubin felt minchins

insight humor—and of course romance minchin who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption added our version of groundhog day is going to be both instantly recognisable and utterly different and that

taylor a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him philandering after settling into a hedonistic groove phil sets his sights on rita determined to sleep with her he spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing with success never in sight phil wonders why he couldnt repeat a better day rita wonders if shell ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things theyve been putting off waiting for some idealized future one day the next morning phil

start of spring there will be sun the next morning phil wakes on february  full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to gobblers knob where the annual ceremony takes place small town usa when he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman larry and his new producer rita before the groundhogs forecast of six more weeks of winter punxsutawney phil while phil and rita eat lunch at a diner larry packs the van preparing for their departure and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town keeping them from leaving rita makes an entry in her journal before the groundhog day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring february ndthere will be sun the next morning phil wakes on february  and he confusedly relives his morning over again including a runin with an obnoxious high school classmate ned ryerson small town usa phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before punxsutawney phil and rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about phils odd behavior february ndthere will be sun the next morning phil wakes on february  and fearing a mental breakdown consults every doctor and healer in town none of which are medically qualified who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies stuck phil decides to selfmedicate at the bar instead and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before the trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and phil is arrested nobody cares the next morning phil wakes on february  with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly does as he pleases and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to nancy taylor a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him philandering after settling into a hedonistic groove phil sets his sights on rita determined to sleep with her he spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing with success never in sight phil wonders why he couldnt repeat a better day rita wonders if shell ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things theyve been putting off waiting for some idealized future one day the next morning phil wakes on february  and smashes his alarm clock act iiedit act two opens at yet another groundhog day ceremony as nancy taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself playing nancy phil arrives at gobblers knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot punxsutawney phil and then himself the next morning phil wakes on february  and exhausts every way to kill himself vowing not to give up hope that he will one day successfully commit suicide phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose tells rita what is happening proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople predicting their actions and finally telling rita things he has learned about her everything about you intrigued rita spends the day with phil learning various things hes done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes if i had my time again that evening rita goes to the bb to see what happens when his day starts over but falls asleep first everything about you reprise the next morning phil wakes on february  alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano philosopher phil learns that neds wife has died and later that evening phil finds a homeless man dead in the park which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable night will come on a new groundhog day phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople philanthropy rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what phil has done for them that day only to discover he is also playing in the band punxsutawney rock in a bachelor auction rita buys a dance with phil and kisses him both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like seeing you the next morning phil wakes to find rita still in his room and a fresh layer of
