detailed description of fund risks investing involves risk principal loss is possible the funds shares will not be listed on an exchange in the foreseeable future if at all it is not anticipated that a secondary market for the shares will develop unless the shares are listed on an exchange thus an investment in the fund is not suitable for investors who might need access to the money they invest for several years or longer the fund may decline to accept any subscription requests for any reason regardless of the order in which such subscription request was submitted to the fund in a particular subscription period if a borrower is unable to make its payments on a loan the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal and interest under such loan as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest will not typically be guaranteed or insured by any thirdparty and will not typically be backed by any governmental authority prospective borrowers supply a variety of information regarding the purpose of the loan income occupation and employment status as applicable to the lending platforms as a general matter platforms do not verify the majority of this information which may be incomplete inaccurate false or misleading prospective borrowers may misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms including their intentions for the use of the loan proceeds marketplace lending instruments are generally not rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros such unrated instruments may be comparable in quality to securities falling into any of the ratings categories used by such nrsros accordingly certain of the funds unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment similar to an investment in junk bonds the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and the fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation there can be no assurance that payments due on underlying marketplace loans will be made at any given time the funds portfolio may be substantially illiquid and subject to increased credit and default risk the shares therefore should be purchased only by investors who could afford the loss of the entire amount of their investment the companys fees and expenses may be considered high and as a result such fees and expenses may offset the companys profits a portion of the investments executed for the company may take place in foreign markets as a result of the foregoing and other risks described in this prospectus an investment in the fund is considered to be highly speculative diversification does not ensure a profit or a guarantee against loss  the fund is classified as nondiversified which means the fund may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund investment in securities of a limited number of issuers exposes the fund to greater market risk and potential losses than if its assets were diversified among the securities of a greater number of issuers  duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income investment to a change in interest rates duration is expressed as a number of years  yield is the income return on an

efficient closedend funds offer a unique structure whereby investors can purchase a diversified fund and potentially generate additional return through the change in the relationship between the closedend funds market price and net asset value nav rivernorth also believes combining a closedend fund strategy with a proven fixed income manager such as doubleline capital lp doubleline® provides an attractive investment vehicle for investors diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss investment strategy rivernorth allocates the funds assets among three principal strategies tactical closedend fund income core fixed income and opportunistic fixed income rivernorth manages the tactical closedend fund income strategy and doubleline manages the core fixed income and opportunistic fixed income strategies rivernorth determines which portion of the funds assets is allocated to each strategy based on market conditions although there is no set minimum for any strategy therefore the amount allocated to any individual strategy may vary between  and  rivernorth however anticipates it will under normal circumstances allocate some portion of the funds assets to each of the three strategies at any given time investment rationale core fixed income portfolio combined with two niche hardtoaccess potential alphagenerating strategies experienced and proven

on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category

earning income and total return risk the fund may invest in lowerquality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the

riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk
