significant accounting policies   nature of operations   franklin hill acquisition corporation the “company” was incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions the company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders the company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with franklin hill the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange   in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of    basis of presentation   the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the company’s unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements   certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december     use of estimates   the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates                cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less cash and cash equivalents amounted to  and  as of september   and december       concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september     income taxes   under asc  “income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration   loss per common share   basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date                level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   recent accounting pronouncements   on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements current gaap requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard management believes that the impact of this asu to the company’s financial statements would be insignificant   in august  the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows” the amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs  settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing  contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims  proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned  life insurance policies  distributions received from equity method investees  beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures                in october  the fasb issued asu  “income

april   see use of proceeds   conflicts of interest certain of the underwriters or their affiliates may hold some of our  senior notes due  and would receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering if we use the net proceeds to repay or repurchase those notes if any one underwriter together with its affiliates were to receive  or more of the net proceeds as a result of the repayment or repurchase such underwriter would be deemed to have a conflict of interest with us in regard to this offering under rule  of the financial industry regulatory authority inc finra accordingly this offering will be conducted in accordance with finra rule  no underwriter with a conflict of interest under finra rule  will confirm sales to any discretionary accounts without receiving specific written approval from the account holder a qualified independent underwriter qiu is not necessary for this offering pursuant to finra rule aa see use of proceeds and underwriting conflicts of interest     s table of contents risk factors in this section we describe risks relating to the notes investors considering purchasing notes should also read the description of risks relating to our business included in item a of our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ended november   if any of those risks develop into actual events the notes or our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or properties could be materially adversely affected risks relating to the notes the notes are subject to the normal risks applicable to debt securities including the possibility that the obligor will not be able to make required payments when they are due in addition the notes are subject to the following risks because the notes are structurally subordinated to the obligations of our nonguarantor subsidiaries your ability to be repaid may be adversely affected to the extent particular subsidiaries are not guaranteeing the notes at a time when you become entitled to repayment substantially all of our operating assets are held by our subsidiaries unless a subsidiary is guaranteeing the notes as described under description of notesthe guarantees holders of any indebtedness or preferred stock of that subsidiary and other creditors of that subsidiary including trade creditors will have claims on the assets of that subsidiary that are prior to the claims of the holders of the notes when the notes are issued some but not all of our subsidiaries will be guaranteeing the notes as described under description of notesthe guarantees accordingly when the notes are issued they will be structurally subordinated to the debt preferred stock and other obligations of some of our subsidiaries the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities as of november   our subsidiaries had  billion of indebtedness including  billion of secured indebtedness of this amount  billion  billion of secured indebtedness was indebtedness of subsidiaries that will not be guaranteeing the notes when they are issued the indebtedness of our subsidiaries that will not be guaranteeing the notes when they are issued includes  million of  senior notes due  that were issued to investors in november  and march  by the parent entity within the rialto segment and another subsidiary in that segment and are guaranteed by the principal entities and most of the other entities in the rialto segment the fact that the notes are unsecured may increase the possibility that you will not be fully repaid if we become insolvent the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or our subsidiaries assets therefore the notes will in effect be junior to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up the holders of any secured debt would receive payments from the assets securing that debt before you receive any payments from sales of those assets there may not be sufficient assets remaining after payment of secured debt to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes that are then outstanding the indenture governing the notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities under limited circumstances if we or a restricted subsidiary ie an actual or potential guarantor of the notes grants a lien securing indebtedness we or the subsidiary must equally and ratably secure the notes and under the indentures relating to our other currently outstanding senior notes we or the subsidiary must also equally and ratably secure those other senior notes however we and our subsidiaries are permitted to incur many types of secured debt without our being required to secure the notes or our other senior notes the   s table of contents notes will be effectively subordinated to that secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing it see description of notescertain covenants as of november   our subsidiaries had  billion of secured indebtedness accordingly as of november   the secured debt of our subsidiaries and the unsecured debt of our nonguarantor subsidiaries totaled  billion federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may affect the enforceability of the guarantees of the notes which could impair your ability to receive payments with regard to the notes any time the subsidiary guarantees of the notes are in effect those guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws might be subordinated to existing or future indebtedness incurred by the guarantor subsidiaries or might not be enforceable if a court or a creditors representative such as a bankruptcy trustee concluded that those subsidiaries received less than fair consideration for the guarantees and        were rendered insolvent as a result of issuing the guarantees        at the time they issued the guarantees were engaged in a business or transaction for which the applicable subsidiaries remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital        at the time they issued the guarantees intended to incur or believed that we or they would incur debts beyond our or their ability to pay as those debts matured or        at the time they issued the guarantees intended to hinder delay or defraud our or their creditors the measure of insolvency varies depending upon the law of the relevant jurisdiction generally however a company is considered insolvent if its debts are greater than the fair value of its property or if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be needed to pay its probable liabilities as its existing debts mature and become absolute the subsidiary guarantees of the notes contain terms that limit the obligations of individual subsidiaries to amounts that would not render them insolvent even if they were required to make payments with regard to the notes that might avoid subordination of the guarantees under fraudulent conveyance laws in at least some jurisdictions see description of notesthe guarantees any guarantees provided by our subsidiaries are subject to possible defenses that may limit your right to receive payment from the guarantors with regard to the notes although guarantees by many of our whollyowned ie directly or indirectly  owned subsidiaries when they are in effect provide the holders of the notes with a direct claim against the assets of those guarantors enforcement of the guarantees against any guarantor would be subject to certain suretyship defenses available to guarantors generally enforcement could also be subject to other defenses available to guarantors in certain circumstances to the extent that guarantees are not enforceable you would not be able to assert a claim successfully against the guarantors see description of notesthe guarantees all of our existing notes contain the same requirement to provide guarantees as the notes offered by this prospectus supplement and some of the existing notes will mature prior to the notes at november   we had approximately  billion of outstanding senior notes comprised of our         senior notes due          senior notes due          senior notes due          senior notes due    s table of contents       senior notes due          senior notes due          senior notes due          convertible senior notes due          convertible senior notes due          senior notes due          senior notes due  and         senior notes due  collectively the existing notes that will rank pari passu with the notes and contain requirements to provide guarantees on essentially the same terms and conditions as the notes substantially all of the existing notes have maturity dates prior to the maturity of the notes accordingly we will be required to repay or refinance those existing notes before the notes mature see other indebtedness the guarantees of the notes may be suspended or released the principal reason our restricted subsidiaries will guarantee the notes is so holders of the notes will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of unsecured senior debt of lennar corporation as a separate entity therefore the guarantee of the notes by a restricted subsidiary will be in effect only while that restricted subsidiary directly or indirectly guarantees a material amount of the debt of lennar corporation as a separate entity to others at present most of our homebuilding subsidiaries and some of our other subsidiaries are guaranteeing our obligations under our principal credit facility see other indebtedness and therefore are guaranteeing the existing notes and will be guaranteeing the notes when they are issued the subsidiaries that guarantee the notes when they are issued may not be guaranteeing lennar corporation debt at all times when notes are outstanding the guarantee of the notes by any restricted subsidiary will be suspended if at any time and for so long as that restricted subsidiary does not directly or indirectly guarantee at least  million principal amount of lennar corporations debt other than the existing notes the notes and any other indebtedness that contains similar guarantee suspension provisions therefore if a restricted subsidiary ceases to guarantee directly or indirectly at least  million of lennar corporations debt obligations that restricted subsidiarys guarantee of the notes will be suspended until such time if any as it is again directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least  million of lennar corporations debt obligations if our restricted subsidiaries guarantee lennar corporation revolving credit lines totaling at least  million we will treat the guarantees of the notes as remaining in effect even during periods when our borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than  million under the circumstances described under description of notesthe guarantees a guarantor may be released entirely from its obligations to guarantee the notes and the existing notes we may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above we and our subsidiaries have the right to incur additional debt in the future subject to any restrictions contained in any of our instruments relating to indebtedness other than the notes some or all of which could be secured debt we will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional unsecured debt there are restrictions on the secured debt we can incur without equally and ratably securing the notes and our other senior notes recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when they are due   s table of contents some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute change of control triggering events in which case we would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the notes if a change of control triggering event occurs you will have the right to require us to repurchase your notes however the provisions relating to a change of control triggering event will not afford protection to holders of notes in the event of some transactions that could adversely affect the notes for example transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations refinancings restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute change of control triggering events requiring us to offer to repurchase the notes in the event of any such transaction the holders of the notes would not have the right to require us to repurchase their notes even though each of those transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings thereby adversely affecting the holders of notes there currently is no public market for the notes so you may be unable to sell your notes the notes are new securities for which there is currently no public trading market consequently the notes may be relatively illiquid and you may be unable to sell your notes we do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or to include the notes in any automated quotation system we have been informed by the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the notes after the offering is completed however the underwriters may cease their market making at any time without notice in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for this type of security and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally as a result we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes if any of the notes are traded after their initial issuance they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price and you may be unable to resell your notes or may be able to sell them only at a substantial discount future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors including prevailing interest rates the market for similar securities general economic conditions and our financial condition performance and prospects an adverse change in the rating of the notes could cause their trading price to fall if a rating service that rates the notes were to lower its rating on the notes below the rating it initially assigns to them or were to announce its intention to put the notes on credit watch the trading price of the notes could decline the notes are not protected by restrictive covenants the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries the indenture contains no covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the notes in the event of a fundamental change or other corporate transaction involving us except to the extent described under description of notesconsolidation merger or sale of assets and description of noteschange of control offer we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offers required by the indentures governing our senior notes which would violate the terms of the senior notes upon a change of control triggering event we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all the outstanding notes at a price in cash equal to  of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the repurchase date whenever we are required to offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event we will have a similar obligation with regard to the existing notes and any other senior notes with similar provisions and we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes the existing notes and such other senior notes for cash at that time in addition   s table of contents our ability to repurchase the notes the existing notes or other of our senior notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of agreements relating to other of our indebtedness that is outstanding at the time the failure to make a required repurchase of the notes would result in a default under the indenture governing the notes a default under the indenture or our failure to purchase existing notes or other senior notes after a change of control would also be a default under other debt securities we have issued and such default or the change of control itself could cause other borrowings we have incurred to become due if the repayment of a substantial amount of indebtedness were to be accelerated we might not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes the existing notes and any other senior notes containing similar provisions see description of noteschange of control offer   s table of contents ratio of earnings to fixed charges        years ended november

income taxes plus fixed charges and certain other adjustments fixed charges consist of interest incurred on all indebtedness and the implied interest component of our rent obligations there was no preferred stock outstanding for any of the periods presented accordingly the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends were identical to the ratios of earnings to fixed charges absence of public market the notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market we currently do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for the notes to be quoted on any quotation system accordingly it is possible that no active trading market for the notes will develop or if any market does develop that such market will not provide significant liquidity to holders of notes use of proceeds we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately  million from the sale of the notes after deducting the underwriting discount and certain expenses of the offering we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt which may include the repayment or repurchase of our  senior notes due  in full or in part the  senior notes due  mature on april   certain of the underwriters or their affiliates may hold some of our  senior notes due  and would receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering if we use the net proceeds to repay or repurchase those notes if any one underwriter together with its affiliates were to receive  or more of the net proceeds as a result of the repayment or repurchase such underwriter would be deemed to have a conflict of interest with us in regard to this offering under finra rule  accordingly this offering will be conducted in accordance with finra rule  see underwriting conflicts of interest other indebtedness our indebtedness at november   is listed in the table in the section of this prospectus supplement captioned capitalization the indenture relating to  million principal amount of  senior notes due  issued and guaranteed by subsidiaries in our rialto segment includes covenants that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute funds to or for the benefit of lennar corporation or subsidiaries that are not obligors or guarantors with regard to the rialto senior notes with that exception and with the exception of the credit agreement described below none of the indebtedness listed in the capitalization table other than as described in this prospectus supplement or the documents incorporated by reference in it has any covenants that restrict our or our subsidiaries ability to make payments on outstanding indebtedness or to pay dividends or requires us to maintain financial attributes all of our existing notes have covenants similar to those in the indenture governing the notes that limit our or our subsidiaries ability to create liens securing indebtedness or enter

holder may present notes for registration of transfer or exchange for other denominations which shall initially be an office or agency of the trustee payments on the notes represented by the global notes will be made to dtc or its nominee as the case may be as the registered owner of the global notes in immediately available funds   s table of contents bookentry delivery and settlement we will issue the notes in the form of one or more permanent global notes in definitive fully registered bookentry form the global notes will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for dtc and registered in the name of cede  co as nominee of dtc dtc has advised us as follows        dtc is a limitedpurpose trust company organized under the new york banking law a banking organization within the meaning of the new york banking law a member of the federal reserve system a clearing corporation within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a clearing agency registered under section a of the exchange act        dtc holds securities for its participating organizations that its participants collectively the participants deposit with dtc and facilitates the settlement among participants of securities transactions such as transfers and pledges in deposited securities through electronic computerized bookentry changes in participants accounts thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates        direct participants include securities brokers and dealers trust companies clearing corporations and other organizations        dtc is owned by a number of its direct participants and by the nyse and the financial industry regulatory authority inc        access to the dtc system is also available to others such as securities brokers and dealers banks and trust companies collectively the indirect participants that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant either directly or indirectly        the rules applicable to dtc and its participants are on file with the sec        persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of dtc only through dtcs participants or dtcs indirect participants we are providing the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of dtc to the holders solely as a matter of convenience these operations and procedures are solely within the control of dtc and are subject to change by dtc from time to time none of us the underwriters or the trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures and each holder is urged to contact dtc or its participants directly to discuss these matters we expect that under procedures established by dtc        upon deposit of the global notes with dtc or its custodian dtc will credit on its internal system the accounts of direct participants designated by the underwriters with portions of the principal amounts of the global notes        ownership of the notes will be shown on and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through records maintained by dtc or its nominee with respect to interests of direct participants and the records of direct and indirect participants with respect to interests of persons other than participants payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global note held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers the participants will be responsible for those payments transfers between participants in dtc will be effected in accordance with dtcs rules and will be settled in immediately available funds   s table of contents the laws of some jurisdictions require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form accordingly the ability to transfer interests in the notes represented by a global note to those persons may be limited in addition because dtc can act only on behalf of its participants who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through participants the ability of a person having an interest in notes represented by a global note to pledge or transfer those interests to persons or entities that do not participate in dtcs system or otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest as long as the notes are represented by one or more global notes dtcs nominee will be the holder of the notes and therefore will be the only entity that can exercise a right to repayment repurchase or conversion of the notes notice by participants or indirect participants or by owners of beneficial interests in a global note held through such participants or indirect participants of the exercise of the option to require purchase of beneficial interests in notes represented by a global note must be transmitted to dtc in accordance with its procedures on a form required by dtc and provided to participants in order to ensure that dtcs nominee will timely exercise a right to purchase with respect to a particular note the beneficial owner of such note must instruct the broker or the participant or indirect participant through which it holds an interest in such note to notify dtc of its desire to exercise a right to purchase different firms have cutoff times for accepting instructions from their customers and accordingly each beneficial owner should consult the broker or other participant or indirect participant through which it holds an interest in a note in order to ascertain the cutoff time by which such an instruction must be given in order for timely notice to be delivered to dtc we will not be liable for any delay in delivery of notices of the exercise of the option to elect purchase notes represented by a global note will be exchangeable for registered certificated securities with the same terms only if  dtc is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within  days  we decide to discontinue use of the system of bookentry transfer through dtc or any successor depositary or  an event of default under the indenture occurs and is continuing neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of notes by dtc or for maintaining supervising or reviewing any records of dtc relating to the notes concerning the trustee the bank of new york mellon
