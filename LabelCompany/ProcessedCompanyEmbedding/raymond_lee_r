boulevard irving texas  httpwwwexxonmobilcom ■ lee r raymond headed one of the most powerful corporations in the world exxon mobil corporation he began his career after receiving a phd in chemical engineering from the university of minnesota the son of a railroad engineer from watertown south dakota raymond kept his personal life out of the limelight while steering one of the worlds largest corporations raymond set his course with exxon early on with innovative moves that cut costs and increased profits the hallmark of his entire career with a changing view on petroleumbased products raymond defended exxon against environmentalists and human rights activists while denying the viability of renewable energy sources he continued to pursue natural gas projects and grew exxon in other parts of the world despite war and threats of war in oilrich countries in the early years of the st century as a result exxon continued to grow even though the protests grew louder reluctant public figure reveals little raymond prided himself on the lack of information in the media about his personal life he was born in watertown south dakota in  in the great plains area of the united states watertown sits on the shores of lake kempeska and by  its population had grown to  most accounts note that raymonds father was a railroad engineer but little is known of raymonds early years in south dakota he began his college career at the university of wisconsin in madison some  miles east of watertown he completed his education with a phd from the university of minnesota in  both of his degrees were in chemical engineering even though raymond did not venture very far from the midwest during his early years his career began in the oil industry in texas when he was hired by the exxon corporation which is the successor company to john d rockefellers standard oil exxons rising star exxon hired raymond in  and put him to work as a production research engineer in tulsa oklahoma for the next  years he received promotions as an engineer eventually ending up on the island of aruba in the caribbean it was in that tropical paradise that he set the course for his career in the oil company by turning around profits at the refinery on the island at the time of his appointment the refinery was losing  million a month by cutting costs and convincing venezuela to provide extraheavy crude oil he had turned the losses into a profit of  million per month by  executives at exxon took notice of the major turnaround and named raymond vice president of exxon enterprises in  raymond said that he received no directives on how to proceed with this diversified company that produced items from solar energy products to a computer chipmaker after studying the company raymond decided to shut down some operations a move approved by the leadership at exxon the company eventually shut down or sold all of the enterprise businesses in existence this move garnered raymond the top slot in esso interamerica a job used to groom future executives for exxon raymond continued to impress his superiors with his costcutting measures especially after such failures as enterprise reliance electric and a shale oil program as the s began raymonds style fit right in with exxons new direction on profit enhancement rather than on growth appointed ceo during the first four years after his appointment as ceo raymond increased profits on operations from the companys oil fields refineries and convenience stores he solidly built up the return on capital which determined for exxon the measure of profitability by  raymond had brought up the return to  percent a feat that according to analysts other companies had been attempting to achieve for years however some analysts believed that raymonds record was not all that impressive some contended that exxon was ready for a monopoly breakup but raymond insisted that such a move would make little sense the analysts cited the decline in the production of crude oil during the s raymond responded to those critics by buying back stock rather than by starting new oil fields without the distraction of exploring for oil fields raymond spent nearly five years getting the most out of a barrel of oil pinching pennies with the processes of oil production transportation and marketing had paid off by  when it was shown that operating costs had been reduced by  billion annually the analyst william randol told fortune in  exxon has proven itself to be very very stingy they just dont piss away money the way other integrated companies do april   grows company again in  raymond made a decision to begin growing exxon once again when exxon reported income of  billion in  raymond decided to change course after spending his first few years as ceo concentrating on the costcutting methods on which his reputation within the company had been founded raymond began by pursuing a new patent that would convert natural gas into a diesellike fuel or heating oil he hoped this new method would boost revenues because a barrel of this new fuel could be produced for  in  the cost of a regular barrel of oil the process itself involved simply adding steam oxygen and catalysts to natural gas even though exxon owned large gas fields transporting the gas had been cost prohibitive with the conversion of natural gas into a liquid form transportation became less costly and required less extensive plants to process the new fuel cooling the natural gas to minus  degrees fahrenheit converts the gas to its liquid form which takes up much less space industry insiders called this new invention a revolution in the oil industry opportunities began arising in russia indonesia and africa to develop gargantuan fields at low costs these countries had begun settling down politically by the late s and raymond took advantage of analysts predictions that asias demand for oil products would begin to expand raymond set a goal of increasing exxons crude oil output by  percent over the next  years management style noted for his reticence to talk to the press raymond kept his own counsel after his appointment as ceo industry insiders said that he had no hobbies nor did he have any colleagues to whom he turned when he needed advice public relations officials with exxon adamantly protected his privacy in  insiders noted that he was the only exxon ceo ever to operate without a clear second in command some found his lack of an inner circle refreshing his predecessor lawrence raul had an intimate inner circle and many who worked for exxon found it difficult to judge whom to court and whom leave alone no such worries existed under the leadership of raymond raymond was the only exxon ceo ever to have earned a phd many found his extreme intelligence to be intimidating while others characterized him as arrogant he was extremely well informed on anything related to exxon businessweek described raymonds workplace in irving texas as being located in a fortresslike building with his office located at the end of a long row of anterooms april   his desk was placed under the painting of a ferociouslooking tiger this interior suite for management at the exxon headquarters was referred to as the god pod a visitor reporting to businessweek said that raymond was always courteous but unmovable if he gives his word which he is reluctant to do he will keep it but he is very difficult to deal with april   even though exxon ruled as the oil giant industry insiders described raymonds management style as centralized raymond was noted for his penchant personally to have a hand in all sorts of deals within the company becoming characterized as a micromanager merger successful but not for employees when exxon and mobil announced a merger in  regulators required the companies to sell some of their assets to allow competition within the oil industry bringing together the two major oil companies meant that the new exxon mobil corporation increased its net earnings by  billion in the first year of the merger with the potential of bringing a total of  billion in growth by  when the merger was announced it immediately became clear that raymond would lead the combined corporation giving the mobil ceo a back seat in the top echelon of exxon mobil before the merger was finished raymond had cut annual costs by  billion after the merger to increase profits raymond reverted to his former costcutting methods eliminating  executive positions out of the  in place between the two companies raymond also made sure that the requirements made by the securities and exchange commission did not hurt the profit sheets either the sales of such assets as service stations and a refinery brought  billion in cash to exxon mobil in addition to cutting executive positions and selling assets raymond began cutting employees throughout the company bringing a total savings of  billion a year within four years of the merger these huge savings came as a result of the elimination of  jobs despite the dire news for employees exxon mobil stock rose to  on the day of the announcement of the job losses analysts applauded the savings and calculated that raymonds estimates were low predicting that the corporation would become a moneymaking machine when raymond announced the job cuts he noted that the entire blueprint for the elimination of  jobs had not been completed but said that  cuts would occur within two years with  outside of the united states and the remaining  at us facilities some of the job losses approximately  came as a result of attrition and those positions were not refilled the rest of the employees were laid off although they were offered a severance package that included four weeks salary for every year worked at the company plus their highest bonus earned with costcutting measures in place raymond readied the company to become the biggest fish in the ocean literally oil exploration in deep ocean waters beckoned raymond despite the high costs associated with this type of experiment especially in the uncharted waters off the coast of africa and south america new century marks critical period as the st century loomed raymond still remained steadfast in his defense of the fossil fuel business stating at an industry conference in  that exxon would stay away from renewable sources of energy he cited exxons history of concentrating on oil and said that oil would continue to be the corporations focus the oil daily reported that raymond was a vehement campaigner on behalf of the fossil fuel lobby and has argued for years that limiting the greenhouse emissions from fossil fuels believed to cause global warning will have a devastating impact on world economic growth february   raymond made this announcement despite the entrance into the renewables business of such competitors as bp amoco and shell those companies predicted that renewables would provide half of the worlds power within  years raymonds adamant stance brought protests from the companys religious shareholders in  the dominican sisters of caldwell new jersey filed a resolution according to the oil daily  the resolution stated that exxon has misinformed shareholders about global warming with inaccurate statements and unreliable information december   further the group accused raymond of making false statements based on unreliable sources they based their findings on a report by dr lloyd keigwin a scientist who had completed studies for exxon on global warming who said that exxon had used his information in a misleading way campaign exxon mobil the group of religious shareholders in exxon cited raymonds claim that he had a petition containing signatures of  scientists who believed that there was no consensus on global warning campaign exxon mobil argued that the signatures had been obtained from the internet with no verification stating that the names included those of tv sitcom characters the spice girls and the singer james brown raymond did not respond to the charges instead he announced that he would seek out methods to increase exxons efficiency while bringing larger returns to its stockholders but he drew the line at outsourcing to other countries for research and development by  raymonds strategies had made exxon mobil one of the worlds most powerful corporations an industry insider told businessweek that exxon had only one way to do things the most efficient with the least risk they want to see the studies if the studies are yours they want to redo them april   as exxons power base grew so did resentment over the companys arrogance which caused analysts to turn skeptical when predicting the future of exxon while analysts respected raymonds leadership they did not have positive feelings about his methods these skeptics pointed to exxons isolation within the industry as causing its own set of problems most of the other large corporations banded together to cut the cost of exploration and development but exxon went its own way retirement postponed when raymond turned  in  exxon announced that he would stay beyond his official retirement in  when he would turn  the company said that it needed time to groom a successor to the ceo analysts suggested that the announcement signaled the companys intention to choose a younger ceo rather than someone within the ranks just behind raymond the decision may have been based on some of the difficult situations that loomed in the future for the company as exxon was awarded gas development projects in saudi arabia in addition in  raymond announced a host of projects in the works regarding natural gas including the production and exploration of major gas sources in bolivia indonesia australia and russia raymond also assured analysts that exxon would still be able to produce the  percent annual average increase in oil and gas production despite the interference of the organization of petroleum exporting countries in initiating restraints on production as well as the war and unrest within the countries from which exxon obtained most of its products raymond continued to push his company on researching the technology that would turn natural gas into a diesel form of fuel he also said that the company was concentrating on its north american sources through new drilling and seismic technologies by  the gains from the merger of exxon and mobil showed that early predictions had underestimated the potential growth the projection of a  billion gain in efficiency production by  turned out to be low within the first quarter of  the figure was upped to  billion with another  billion added in  raymond said his predictions had proven that he knew how to produce profits despite changes in the economy defending environmental and human rights record raymond often defended the environmental and human rights record of exxon against protesters who said that the oil giant did not use accurate research or treat all of its employees across the globe fairly despite his acknowledgment at a  shareholder meeting that there might be a high risk of climate change due to the use of fossil fuels raymond still maintained that huge differences of opinion remained among the different researchers in climate science he asked for further research but also insisted that an initiative in emissions reductions with car manufacturers was still needed during this june  meeting shareholders were asked to vote on two proposals both opposed by raymond one concerned more development of renewable energy sources the other involved a ban on discrimination against homosexuals amnesty international and greenpeace both hosted protest rallies in dallas the day before the meeting and their representatives also attended the meeting while advisers on the voting suggested that shareholders support the renewable energy proposal the motion was rejected by an  percent vote raymond continued his campaign to discredit the viability of renewable energy sources weekly petroleum argus reported that raymond said even green energy has an impact on the environment noting that largescale solar and wind farms take up land and can affect wildlife june   to appease the protesters raymond did concede that exxon would report greenhouse gas emissions while cutting the emissions at facilities in an attempt to reduce energy consumption by  percent over a severalyear period in addition raymond continued to stress exxons dedication to work with automobile manufacturers on reducing vehicle emissions he announced that new methods might include advancement in the internal combustion engine and more dependence on fuel cells raymond told shareholders that the company was committed to work with the new technologies in an effort to remain competitive within the oil industry he stressed that these new technologies would reduce not only costs but also the impact on the environment his commitment to this goal was reflected in the  million spent by exxon by  on renewable energy sources research in  raymond maintained that he would remain patient as the project to convert natural gas continued its slow progress to completion also the expansion into russia entered into negotiations in  analysts speculated that an agreement with russia remained raymonds goal before he entered into a discussion about his retirement raymond told petroleum intelligence weekly  i totally recognize i cant shed my exxon background and whatever i do reflects on the company so thats why im a lifer and im pleased to be a lifer november   sources for further information exxon turns its back on renewable energy to focus on strengths in traditional areas oil daily  february
