and   note   summary of significant accounting policies security valuation  taxexempt municipal securities are stated at the value determined by the evaluator the evaluator may determine the value of the bonds  on the basis of current bid prices of the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by each of the trusts  on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds  by determining the value of the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above security cost  the original cost to the trust colorado imit was based on the determination by jj kenny co of the offering prices of the bonds on the date of deposit july   since the valuation is based upon the bid prices the trust colorado imit recognized a downward adjustment of  on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices this downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the trust for the period ended june   unit valuation  the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in each trust based upon  the cash on hand in such trust or monies in the process of being collected  the bonds in such trust based on the value determined by the evaluator and  interest accrued thereon less accrued expenses of the trust if any federal income taxes  the trust is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes each unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of such trust and accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes other  the financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis

amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium the amount of which will decline in subsequent years sf indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds pr indicates a bond has been prerefunded redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units conversely to the extent that the bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed bonds and there will be distributed to unitholders the principal amount in excess of  per unit semiannually and any premium received on such redemption however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next succeeding monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date the estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions for the federal tax effect on unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions see federal tax status in part ii insurance  insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the colorado imit trust has been obtained by the trust or by one of the preinsured bond insurers as indicated in the bond name such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units for bonds covered under the trusts insurance policy the insurance is effective only while bonds thus insured are held in the trust and the insurance premium which is a trust obligation is paid on a monthly basis the premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the bond involved is payable by the issuer note   portfolio continued an accounting and auditing guide issued by the american institute of certified public accountants states that for financial reporting purposes insurance coverage of the type acquired by the trust does not have any measurable value in the absence of default of the underlying bonds or indication of the probability of such default in the opinion of the evaluator there is no

for units and to continuously offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the bonds in the portfolio of the trust plus interest accrued to the date of settlement if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices in the event that a market is not maintained for the units a unitholder desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate offering price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds the secondary market cost to investors is based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to average maturity of the bonds in the portfolio the sales charge ranges from  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds for a trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average maturity to  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds for a trust with a portfolio with twentyone or more years to average maturity compensation of evaluator and supervisor  the supervisor receives a fee for providing portfolio supervisory services for the trust  per unit

federal income taxation and in the case of a state trust federal and state income taxation and conservation of capital through an investment in diversified portfolios of federal and state taxexempt obligations a state intermediate laddered maturity trust has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediateterm interestbearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately  to  years in which roughly  of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the trust there is of course no guarantee that the trusts will achieve their objectives a trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxexempt fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained from a municipal bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts in addition these bonds are often not available in small amounts in selecting bonds for the trusts the sponsor considered the following factors among others a with respect to insured trusts the bonds must be insured with a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investor service inc moodys rating of aaa with respect to all quality trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of at least a a moodys rating of at least a or if not rated credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor and with respect to all other trusts either the standard  poors rating of the bonds was not less than bbb or the moodys rating of the bonds was not less than baa including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing taxexempt bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in an investment grade municipal trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors the bonds your trust invests in municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds we seek to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment these bonds are described in greater detail in the information supplement see additional information general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor own this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust for example future legislation could reduce tax rates impose a flat tax exempt all investment income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns are set forth in the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the minimum purchase is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life eltr life of a trusts portfolio enlargedownload table eltr life sales charge eltr life sales charge eltr life sales charge                                                to   the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating estimated longterm return see estimated current and longterm returns the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers for purchases by investors who purchase units through registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge is imposed fee accounts the sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a trust employees employees officers and directors including their spouses and children under  living in the same household and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons of van kampen funds inc and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase units at the public offering price less the applicable dealer concession when permitted offering price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the fund b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an insured trust if any the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an insured trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest accrued interest to carry accrued interest to carry is added to the public offering price for insured municipals income trust st insured multiseries and prior series and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  and prior series accrued interest to carry consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on securities in each trust is actually paid either monthly quarterly if applicable or semiannually to such trust however interest on the securities in each trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis because of this each trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee because of coupons that are not yet due for this reason the public offering price will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the structure of the interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders of a trust until it receives interest payments on the securities in such trust the trustee is obligated to provide its own funds at times in order to advance interest distributions the trustee will recover these advancements when such interest is received interest account balances are established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions the interest account balances are also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances and since the funds held by the trustee may be used by it to earn interest thereon it benefits thereby if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units or if the bonds in a trust are sold or otherwise removed or if a trust is liquidated he will receive at that time his proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of redemption purchased and accrued interest added to the public offering price for insured municipals income trust ndrd insured multiseries and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  is purchased interest and accrued interest included in the public offering price for insured municipals income trust th insured multiseries and subsequent series and insured municipals income trust and investors quality taxexempt trust multiseries  and subsequent series is accrued interest only references to accrued interest in this prospectus include both purchased interest and accrued interest as described in this section purchased interest  purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the securities from the later of the last payment date on the securities or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unitholders as units are redeemed or securities mature or are called see summary of essential financial information in this prospectus part i for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the price unitholders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of a trust accrued interest  accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units as indicated in purchased interest accrued interest as of the first settlement date includes purchased interest in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unitholders the trustee may advance a portion of such accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby accrued interest accrued interest is added to the public offering price for all trusts not listed above accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although each trust accrues interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest as described in this paragraph to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units for all trusts not mentioned above unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states brokerdealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units equal to  of the sales charge applicable to the transaction provided that the units are acquired from the sponsor certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers equal to the agency commission referred to above is retained by or remitted to the banks any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge sponsor compensation the sponsor will receive a gross sales commission equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved see public offeringgeneral in addition the sponsor realized a profit or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a trust the sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in the trusts were acquired the sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of units excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed if any will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased units at a price above or below the purchase price brokerdealers of the trusts banks andor others are eligible to participate in a program in which such firms receive from the sponsor a nominal award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of unit investment trusts created by the sponsor during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participate in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trusts these programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that the trusts will receive from the units sold approximately every eighteen months the sponsor holds a business seminar which is open to certain underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors the sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with the seminar excluding travel costs these underwriters are invited to send a certain number of representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during a designated time period market for units although not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash on hand less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust and less any accrued trust expenses if the supply of units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it the sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of units or discontinue purchases of units at these prices if a market is not maintained and the unitholder cannot find another purchaser a unitholder will be able to dispose of units by tendering them to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price see rights of unitholdersredemption of units a unitholder who wishes to dispose of his units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price per unit it may purchase the units not later than the day on which the units would otherwise have been redeemed by the trustee rights of unitholders  distributions of interest and principal interest received by a trust pro rated on an annual basis will be distributed monthly unless a unitholder elects to receive quarterly or semiannual distributions certain trusts offer only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semiannual distribution options the distribution options applicable to a trust are described in prospectus part i the plan of distribution selected by a unitholder will remain in effect until changed unitholders who purchase units in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a card which may be obtained from the trustee and return the card to the trustee with their certificates and other documentation required by the trustee certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being lost or stolen if the card and certificate are properly presented to the trustee the change will become effective on the first day after the next semiannual record date and will remain effective until changed interest received by a trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest is credited by the trustee to the interest account other receipts are credited to the principal account after deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the trustee without interest for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date all distributions will be net of estimated expenses funds in the principal account will be distributed on each semiannual distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding semiannual record date the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the principal or interest account but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these funds nor to make a distribution from the principal account unless the amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least  per unit however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account equal or exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the related monthly record date because interest payments are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the interest account on the next record date persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the purchase under the applicable plan of distribution reinvestment option unitholders may elect to have distributions on their units automatically reinvested in shares of certain van kampen mutual funds which are registered in the unitholders state of residence the reinvestment funds each reinvestment fund has investment objectives that differ from those of the trusts the prospectus relating to each reinvestment fund describes its investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment a unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the reinvestment funds from the sponsor after becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan each trust distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date to purchase shares of the applicable reinvestment fund at a net asset value computed on such date unitholders with an existing planned reinvestment option pro program account whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments may transfer their existing account into a new pro account which allows purchases of reinvestment fund shares at net asset value confirmations of all reinvestments will be mailed to the unitholder by the reinvestment fund a participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions in cash by notifying the trustee in writing at least five days before the next distribution date each reinvestment fund its sponsor and investment adviser have the right to terminate its

signature guaranteed or by providing satisfactory indemnity such as in connection with lost stolen or destroyed certificates and by payment of applicable governmental charges if any redemption of units cannot occur until certificates representing the units or satisfactory indemnity have been received by the trustee no later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender the unitholder will receive an amount for each unit equal to the redemption price per unit next computed after receipt by the trustee of the tender of units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which units are received by the trustee except that as regards units received after the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange the date of tender is the next day on which that exchange is open and the units will be deemed to have been tendered to the trustee on that day for redemption at the redemption price redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of receipt redemption requests received by the trustee after the evaluation time and redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the trustee are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the trustee on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in a timely manner certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests units redeemed directly through the trustee are not subject to such fees under internal revenue service regulations the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of a unit redemption if the trustee has not received the unitholders tax identification number as required by such regulations any amount withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however at any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption the unitholder should provide a tax identification number to the trustee in order to avoid this possible backup withholding the redemption price per unit as well as the secondary market public offering price will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as of the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange on the date any such determination is made the evaluator determines the redemption price per unit on days units are tendered for redemption the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit on the basis of i the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected ii the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds except for cases in which the value of insurance has been included iii accrued interest less a amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and b the accrued trust expenses the evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in public offeringoffering price in determining the redemption price per unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance maintained on the bonds in an insured trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default for a description of the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained by the insured trusts see public offeringoffering price accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account all other amounts will be withdrawn from the principal account units so redeemed shall be cancelled the price at which units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by the unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by the units redeemed the trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions when bonds are sold the size and diversity of the trust will be reduced sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the new york stock exchange is closed other than for customary weekend and holiday closings or during which the sec determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable or

main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust will hold various debt obligations the bonds of state and local governmental entities that constitute debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and market discount and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses exclusion from gross income of interest at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities based on certain representations and subject to compliance with certain covenants neither the sponsor nor its counsel have made any special review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds the bases for the bond counsel opinions or compliance with the covenants required for taxexemption the internal revenue service the service has an ongoing program of auditing taxexempt obligations to determine whether in the view of the service interest on such taxexempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes it cannot be predicted whether or not the service will commence an audit of any of the bonds if an audit is commenced under current procedures of the service unit holders may have no right to participate in such procedure if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable your pro rata share of interest on the bonds will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the bonds however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign corporations ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain unit holders including without limitation corporations subject to the branch profits tax financial institutions certain insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and unit holders who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations if you are a substantial user of the facilities financed with the proceeds of certain bonds or a related person to a substantial user you will not be able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these bonds substantial user and related person are defined under federal income tax law for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax preference in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax depends upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti of a corporation excluding s corporations regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts remics or fasits is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all of the bonds in the trust in addition a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however also treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations discount accrued interest and premium on bonds some bonds may have been issued with original issue discount this generally means that the bonds were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes thus the accrual of original discount will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent as interest on the bonds as discussed above your basis of each bond that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the bond over the purchase price of the bond market discount can arise based on the price your trust pays for a bond or based on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the bond when the bond is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions alternatively some bonds may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any bond generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you must amortize bond premium on a constant yield basis over the remaining term of the bond in a manner that takes into account potential call dates and call prices you cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a bond the amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the taxexempt interest received as bond premium is amortized it reduces your basis in the bond the tax basis reduction requirement may result in your realizing a taxable gain when your units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than your cost if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a bond you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that bond when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the bond this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of bonds that were issued with original issue discount exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income your ability to deduct trust expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are allocable to taxexempt interest from the trust state trust risk factors and tax status  arizona risk factors the financial condition of the state of arizona is affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning arizona risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information tax status at the time of the closing for each arizona trustspecial counsel to the trust for arizona tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing arizona income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to arizona income taxation substantially to the effect that the assets of the trust will consist of interestbearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the state of arizona the state its political subdivisions and authorities the arizona bonds and certain bonds issued by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds collectively the arizona bonds and possession bonds shall be referred to herein as the bonds provided the interest on such bonds received by the trust is exempt from state income taxes neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters it is assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the arizona income tax the arizona income tax we have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition it is assumed that with respect to the arizona bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the bonds is exempt from the arizona income tax and with respect to the possession bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions to the effect that the interest on the possession bonds is exempt from all state and local income taxation neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith in the opinion of special counsel to the trust under then existing arizona law and based on the assumptions set forth above for arizona income tax purposes each unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the arizona trust and the income of the arizona trust therefore will be treated as the income of the unitholder under state law for arizona income tax purposes interest on the bonds which is excludable from federal gross income and which is exempt from arizona income taxes when received by the arizona trust and which would be excludable from federal gross income and exempt from arizona income taxes if received directly by a unitholder will retain its status as taxexempt interest when received by the arizona trust and distributed to the unitholders to the extent that interest derived from the arizona trust by a unitholder with respect to the arizona bonds is excludable from federal gross income such interest will not be subject to arizona income taxes interest on the possession bonds which is excludable from gross income for federal tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the arizona trust will be exempt from arizona income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the arizona trust and received by the unitholders each unitholder will receive taxable gain or loss for arizona income tax purposes when bonds held in the arizona trust are sold exchanged redeemed or paid at maturity or when the unitholder redeems or sells units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion of bond discount or amortization of premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the arizona trust if later amounts paid by the insurer under an insurance policy or policies issued to the trust if any with respect to the bonds in the trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be exempt from state income taxes if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds arizona law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the arizona trust the interest on which is exempt from arizona income taxes special rules apply to financial institutions and such institutions should consult their own tax advisors with respect to deductions of interest neither the bonds nor the units will be subject to arizona property taxes sales tax or use tax counsel to the sponsor has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of arizona law ownership of the units may result in collateral

described in additional information tax status at the time of the closing for each colorado trust counsel to the fund for colorado tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing colorado income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to colorado income taxation substantially to the effect that the assets of the colorado trust will consist of interestbearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the state of colorado colorado or counties municipalities authorities or political subdivisions thereof the colorado bonds or by the commonwealth of puerto rico the puerto rico bonds collectively the bonds the interest on which is expected to qualify as exempt from colorado income taxes neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although counsel to the fund expresses no opinion with respect to the issuance of the bonds in rendering its opinion expressed herein it has assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the income tax imposed by the state that is applicable to individuals and corporations thestate income tax it is assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds i opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities ii with respect to the colorado bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the colorado bonds is exempt from the state income tax the state income tax and iii with respect to the possession bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the puerto rico bonds is exempt from all state and local income taxation neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the colorado trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith this opinion does not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of colorado in the opinion of counsel to the fund in summary under existing colorado law  because colorado income tax law is based upon the federal law the colorado trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes of colorado income taxation  with respect to colorado unitholders in view of the relationship between federal and colorado tax computations described above i each colorado unitholder will be treated as owning a pro rata share of each asset of the colorado trust for colorado income tax purposes in the proportion that the number of units of such trust held by the unitholder bears to the total number of outstanding units of the colorado trust and the income of the colorado trust will therefore be treated as the income of each colorado unitholder under colorado law in the proportion described and an item of income of the colorado trust will have the same character in the hands of a colorado unitholder as it would have if the colorado unitholder directly owned the assets of the colorado trust ii interest on bonds that would not be includible in income for colorado income tax purposes when paid directly to a colorado unitholder will be exempt from colorado income taxation when received by the colorado trust and attributed to such colorado unitholder and when distributed to such colorado unitholder iii to the extent that interest income derived from the colorado trust by a unitholder with respect to puerto rico bonds is exempt from state taxation pursuant to  usc  such interest will not be subject to the colorado state income tax iv any proceeds paid under an insurance policy or policies if any issued to the colorado trust with respect to the bonds in the colorado trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from colorado adjusted gross income if and to the same extent as such interest is so excludable for federal income tax purposes if paid in the normal course by the issuer notwithstanding that the source of payment is from insurance proceeds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds v each colorado unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss when the colorado trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or when the colorado unitholder redeems or sells units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a colorado unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the colorado unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the colorado trust if later vi tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in colorado unitholders realizing taxable gain when their units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost and vii if interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a colorado unitholder to purchase units in the colorado trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes it also will be nondeductible for colorado income tax purposes unitholders should be aware that all taxexempt interest including their share of interest on the bonds paid to the colorado trust is taken into account for purposes of determining eligibility for the colorado property taxrentheat rebate counsel to the fund has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of colorado law ownership of the units may result in collateral colorado tax consequences to certain taxpayers prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences connecticut risk factors the financial condition of the state of connecticut is affected by various national economic social and environmental

decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning connecticut risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information  tax status at the time of the closing for each connecticut trust special counsel to the fund for connecticut tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing connecticut income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to connecticut income taxation substantially to the effect that the assets of the trust will consist of obligations the bonds certain of the bonds have been issued by or on behalf of the state of connecticut or its political subdivisions or other public instrumentalities state or local authorities districts or similar public entities created under the laws of the state of connecticut connecticut bonds the balance of the bonds have been issued by or on behalf of entities classified for the relevant purposes as territories or possessions of the united states including one or more of puerto rico guam or the virgin islands the interest on the obligations of which federal law would prohibit connecticut from taxing if received directly by the unitholders certain connecticut bonds in the trust were issued prior to the enactment of the connecticut income tax on the connecticut taxable income of individuals trusts and estates the connecticut income tax therefore bond counsel to the issuers of such bonds did not opine as to the exemption of the interest on such bonds from such tax however the sponsor and special counsel to the trust for connecticut tax matters believe that such interest will be so exempt interest on other bonds in the trust if any is in the opinion of bond counsel to such issuers exempt from state taxation in the opinion of day berry  howard llp special counsel to the fund for connecticut tax matters which relies explicitly on the opinion of chapman and cutler llp regarding federal income tax matters in summary under existing connecticut law the trust is not liable for any tax on or measured by net income imposed by the state of connecticut interest income of the trust from a bond issued by or on behalf of the state of connecticut any political subdivision thereof or public instrumentality state or local authority district or similar public entity created under the laws of the state of connecticut a connecticut bond or from a bond issued by united states territories or possessions the interest on which federal law would prohibit connecticut from taxing if received directly by a unitholder from the issuer thereof is not taxable under the connecticut tax on the connecticut taxable income of individuals trusts and estates the connecticut income tax when any such interest is received by the trust or distributed by it to such a unitholder insurance proceeds received by the trust representing maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trust are not taxable under the connecticut income tax if and to the same extent as such interest would not be taxable thereunder if paid directly to the trust by the issuer of such bonds gains and losses recognized by a unitholder for federal income tax purposes upon the maturity redemption sale or other disposition by the trust of a bond held by the trust or upon the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit of the trust held by a unitholder are taken into account as gains or losses respectively for purposes of the connecticut income tax except that in the case of a unitholder holding a unit of the trust as a capital asset such gains and losses recognized upon the maturity redemption sale or exchange of a connecticut bond held by the trust are excluded from gains and losses taken into account for purposes of such tax and no opinion is expressed as to the treatment for purposes of such tax of gains and losses recognized to the extent attributable to connecticut bonds upon the redemption sale or other disposition by a unitholder of a unit of the trust held by him the portion of any interest income or capital gain of the trust that is allocable to a unitholder that is subject to the connecticut corporation business tax is includible in the gross income of such unitholder for purposes of such tax and an interest in a unit of the trust that is owned by or attributable to a connecticut resident at the time of his death is includible in his gross estate for purposes of the connecticut succession tax and the connecticut estate tax generally a unitholder recognizes gain or loss for purposes of the connecticut income tax to the same extent as the unitholder recognizes gain or loss for federal income tax purposes ordinarily this would mean that gain or loss would be recognized by a unitholder upon the maturity redemption sale or other disposition by the trust of a bond held by it or upon the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit of the trust held by the unitholder however gains and losses from the sale or exchange of connecticut bonds held as capital assets are not taken into account for purposes of this tax regulations indicate that this rule would apply to gain or loss recognized by a unitholder holding a unit of the trust as a capital asset upon the maturity redemption sale or other disposition of a connecticut bond held by the trust however it is not clear whether this rule would also apply to the extent attributable to connecticut bonds held by the trust to gain or loss recognized by a unitholder upon the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit of the trust held by such unitholder unitholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning these matters florida risk

trust units see federal tax status in prospectus part ii in the opinion of special counsel to the trust for maryland tax matters in summary under existing maryland income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to maryland income taxation  for maryland state and local income tax purposes the maryland quality trust will not be recognized as an association taxable as a corporation but rather as a fiduciary whose income will not be subject to maryland state and local income taxation  to the extent that interest and accrued original issue discount derived from the maryland quality trust by a unitholder with respect to the bonds in the trust is excludable from federal gross income such interest will not be subject to maryland state or local income taxes interest paid to a financial institution will be subject to the maryland franchise tax  in the case of taxpayers who are individuals maryland presently imposes an income tax on items of tax preference with reference to such items as defined in the internal revenue code as amended from time to time for purposes of calculating the federal alternative minimum tax interest paid on certain private activity bonds constitutes a tax preference item for the purpose of calculating the federal alternative minimum tax accordingly if the maryland quality trust holds such bonds  of the interest on such bonds in excess of a threshold amount is taxable in maryland  capital gain including gain realized by a unitholder from the redemption sale or other disposition of a unit will be included in the taxable base of unitholders for maryland state and local income taxation purposes however maryland defines the taxable net income of individuals as federal adjusted gross income with certain modifications likewise the maryland taxable net income of corporations is federal taxable income with certain modifications there is available to maryland income taxpayers a modification which allows those taxpayers to subtract from the maryland taxable base the gain included in federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income as the case may be which is realized from the disposition of obligations issued by the state of maryland or its political subdivisions by the maryland quality trust consequently by making that modification a unitholder who is entitled to make the subtraction modification will not be subject to maryland state or local income tax with respect to gain realized upon the disposition of obligations issued by the state of maryland and its political subdivisions by the maryland quality trust profit realized by a financial institution from the sale or exchange of bonds will be subject to the maryland franchise tax these opinions relate only to the treatment of the maryland quality

further information concerning michigan risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information tax status in the opinion of special counsel to the trust for michigan tax matters in summary under existing michigan law the michigan imit trust and the owners of units will be treated for purposes of the michigan income tax laws and the single business tax in substantially the same manner as they are for purposes of the federal income tax laws as currently enacted accordingly we have relied upon the opinion of messrs chapman and cutler llp as to the applicability of federal income tax under the internal revenue code of  to the michigan imit trust and the unitholders under the income tax laws of the state of michigan the michigan imit trust is not an association taxable as a corporation the income of the michigan imit trust will be treated as the income of the unitholders and be deemed to have been received by them when received by the michigan imit trust interest on the underlying bonds which is exempt from tax under these laws when received by michigan imit trust will retain its status as tax exempt interest to the unitholders for purposes of the foregoing michigan tax laws each unitholder will be considered to have received his pro rata share of bond interest when it is received by the michigan imit trust and each unitholder will have a taxable event when the michigan imit trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or when the unitholder redeems or sells his certificate to the extent the transaction constitutes a taxable event for federal income tax purposes the tax cost of each unit to a unitholder will be established and allocated for purposes of these michigan tax laws in the same manner as such cost is established and allocated for federal income tax purposes the michigan intangibles tax was totally repealed effective january   the michigan single business tax replaced the tax on corporate and financial institution income under the michigan income tax and the intangible tax with respect to those intangibles of persons subject to the single business tax the income from which would be considered in computing the single business tax persons are subject to the single business tax only if they are engaged in business activity as defined in the act under the single business tax both interest received by the michigan imit trust on the underlying bonds and any amount distributed from the michigan imit trust to a unitholder if not included in determining taxable income for federal income tax purposes is also not included in the adjusted tax base upon which the single business tax is computed of either the michigan imit trust or the unitholders if the michigan imit trust or the unitholders have a taxable event for federal income tax purposes when the michigan imit trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or the unitholder redeems or sells his certificate an amount equal to any gain realized from such taxable event which was included in the computation of taxable income for federal income tax purposes plus an amount equal to any capital gain of an individual realized in connection with such event but excluded in computing that individuals federal taxable income will be included in the tax base against which after allocation apportionment and other adjustments the single business tax is computed the tax base will be reduced by an amount equal to any capital loss realized from such a taxable event whether or not the capital loss was deducted in computing federal taxable income in the year the loss occurred unitholders should consult their tax advisor as to their status under michigan law the single business tax is being phasedout with total repeal after december   any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the trustee of the trust or paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which when received by the unitholders represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the trustee will be excludable from the michigan income tax laws and the single business tax if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations while treatment under the michigan intangibles tax is not premised upon the characterization of such proceeds under the internal revenue code the michigan department of treasury should adopt the same approach as under the michigan income tax laws and the single business tax as the tax reform act of  eliminated the capital gain deduction for tax years beginning after december   the federal adjusted gross income the computation base for the michigan income tax of a unitholder will be increased accordingly to the extent such capital gains are realized when the michigan imit trust disposes of a bond or when the unitholder redeems or sells a unit to the extent such transaction constitutes a taxable event for federal income tax purposes minnesota risk factors the financial condition of the state of minnesota is affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning minnesota risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information tax status at the time of the closing for each minnesota trust special counsel to the trust for minnesota tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing minnesota income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to minnesota income taxation substantially to the effect that we understand that the minnesota trust will only have income consisting of i interest from bonds issued by the state of minnesota and its political and governmental subdivisions municipalities and governmental agencies and instrumentalities the minnesota bonds and bonds issued by possessions of the united states including bonds issued by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds and collectively with the minnesota bonds the bonds which would be exempt from federal and minnesota income taxation when paid directly to an individual trust or estate ii gain on the disposition of such bonds and iii proceeds paid under certain insurance policies issued to the trustee or to the issuers of the bonds which represent maturing interest or principal payments on defaulted bonds held by the trustee neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters it is assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii the interest thereon is exempt from the income tax imposed by minnesota that is applicable to individuals trusts and estates the minnesota income tax it should be noted that interest on the minnesota bonds is subject to tax in the case of corporations subject to the minnesota corporate franchise tax or the corporate alternative minimum tax and is a factor in the computation of the minimum fee applicable to financial institutions the opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of minnesota we have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition we have assumed that with respect to the minnesota bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the minnesota bonds is exempt from the minnesota income tax and with respect to the possession bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the possession bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the minnesota trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith although minnesota state law provides that interest on minnesota bonds is exempt from minnesota state income taxation the minnesota state legislature has enacted a statement of intent that interest on the minnesota bonds should be subject to minnesota state income taxation if it is judicially determined that the exemption discriminates against interstate commerce effective for the calendar year in which such a decision becomes final it cannot be predicted whether a court would render such a decision or whether as a result thereof interest on minnesota bonds and therefore distributions by the minnesota trust would become subject to minnesota state income taxation in the opinion of special counsel to the trust under then existing minnesota law and based upon the assumptions set forth above  the minnesota trust is not an association taxable as a corporation  income on the bonds which is excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax when received by the minnesota trust and which would be excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax if received directly by a unitholder will be excludable from minnesota taxable income for purposes of the minnesota income tax when received by the minnesota trust and distributed to such unitholder  to the extent that interest on certain bonds except with respect to possession bonds as to which no opinion is expressed if any is includible in the computation of alternative minimum taxable income for federal income tax purposes such interest will also be includible in the computation of alternative minimum taxable income for purposes of the minnesota alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals estates and trusts  each unitholder of the minnesota trust will recognize gain or loss for minnesota income tax purposes if the trustee disposes of a bond whether by redemption sale or otherwise or if the unitholder redeems or sells units of the minnesota trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such unitholder for federal income tax purposes  tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in unitholders realizing taxable gain for minnesota income tax purposes when their units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost  proceeds if any paid under individual insurance policies obtained by issuers of bonds or the trustee which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the trustee will be excludible from minnesota net income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludible from minnesota net income if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted obligation provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds and  to the extent that interest derived from the minnesota trust by a unitholder with respect to any possession bonds would be excludible from gross income for federal income tax purposes and would be exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law if the unitholder directly owned the possession bonds such interest will not be subject to the minnesota income tax when distributed by the minnesota trust and received by the unitholders as noted above we have expressed no opinion as to the treatment of interest on the possession bonds for purposes of the minnesota corporate franchise tax or the alternative minimum tax or whether it is a factor in the computation of the minimum fee applicable to financial institutions although a federal statute currently provides that bonds issued by the government of puerto rico or by its authority are exempt from all state and local taxation the supreme court of minnesota has held that interest earned on bonds issued by the government of puerto rico may be included in taxable net income for purposes of computing the minnesota bank excise tax the state of minnesota could apply the same reasoning in determining whether interest on the possession bonds is subject to the taxes listed above on which we express no opinion we have not examined any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the minnesota trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and therefore express no opinions to the exemption from state income taxes of interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder chapman and cutler llp has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of minnesota law ownership of the units may result in collateral minnesota tax consequences to

is expressed herein we have been informally advised by the oklahoma tax commission that any insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations which are excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes should be excludable from the oklahoma state income tax to the same extent as such interest would have been if paid by the issuer of such bonds held by the oklahoma trust provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the obligations rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the obligations  the oklahoma state income tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the oklahoma trust the interest on which is exempt from such tax if such interest is not deductible for federal income tax purposes special rules

franchise tax although chapman and cutler llp expresses no opinion with respect to taxation of the oklahoma trust for oklahoma franchise tax purposes there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the oklahoma trust is not subject to the oklahoma franchise tax because the trust would not be considered as doing business within the state the oklahoma franchise tax is equal to  per  of the capital used invested or employed in the state of oklahoma not to exceed  per year under recently enacted oklahoma legislation a passthrough entity must withhold income tax at a rate of five percent of the

and that the exemption so granted extends to all recipients of interest paid thereon through the trust this opinion does not extend to socalled  obligations  the income of the trust would be treated

interest derived by the trust that would not be includible in income for south carolina income tax purposes when paid directly to a south carolina unitholder will be exempt from south carolina income

of a bond whether by sale payment on maturity retirement or otherwise or if the unitholder redeems or sells his unit  the trust would be regarded under south carolina law as a common trust fund and therefore not subject to taxation under any income tax law of south carolina the above described opinion has been concurred in by an informal ruling of the south carolina tax commission pursuant to

of the state of tennessee is affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the states economic base is diversified consisting of manufacturing construction and service industries supplemented by a diverse agricultural sector these sectors tend to be more cyclical than other sectors the state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning tennessee risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information tax status at the time of the closing for each tennessee trust special counsel to the trust for tennessee tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing tennessee income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to tennessee income taxation substantially to the effect that the assets of the tennessee trust will consist of bonds issued by the state of tennessee the state or any county or any municipality or political subdivision thereof including any agency board authority or commission the interest on which is exempt from the hall income tax imposed by the state of tennessee tennessee bonds or by the commonwealth of puerto rico the puerto rico bonds collectively the bonds under tennessee law a unit investment trust taxable as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes is entitled to special tennessee state tax treatment as more fully described below with respect to its proportionate share of interest income received or accrued with respect to the tennessee bonds tennessee law also provides an exemption for distributions made by a unit investment trust or mutual fund that are attributable to bonds or securities of the united states government or any agency or instrumentality thereof us government agency or instrumentality bonds if it were determined that the tennessee trust held assets other than tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds a proportionate share of distributions from the tennessee trust would be taxable to unitholders for tennessee income tax purposes further because this provision appears only to provide an exemption for distributions that relate to interest income distributions by the trust that relate to capital gains realized from the sale or redemption of tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds are likely to be treated as taxable dividends for purposes of the hall income tax however capital gains realized directly by a unitholder when the unitholder sells or redeems his unit will not be subject to the hall income tax the opinion set forth below assumes that the interest on the tennessee bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the hall income tax under tennessee state law this opinion does not address the taxation of persons other than fulltime residents of the state of tennessee because this provision only provides an exemption for distributions attributable to interest on tennessee bonds or us government agency or instrumentality bonds it must be determined whether bonds issued by the government of puerto rico qualify as us government agency or instrumentality bonds for hall income tax purposes there is currently no published administrative interpretation or opinion of the attorney general of tennessee dealing with the status of distributions made by unit investment trusts such as the tennessee trust that are attributable to interest paid on bonds issued by the government of puerto rico however in a letter dated august   the commissioners letter the commissioner of the state of tennessee department of revenue advised that puerto rico would be an instrumentality of the us government and treated bonds issued by the government of puerto rico as us government agency or instrumentality bonds based on this conclusion the commissioner advised that distributions from a mutual fund attributable to investments in puerto rico bonds are exempt from the hall income tax both the sponsor and chapman and cutler llp for purposes of its opinion as set forth below have assumed based on the commissioners letter that bonds issued by the government of puerto rico are us government agency or instrumentality bonds however it should be noted that the position of the commissioner is not binding and is subject to change even on a retroactive basis the sponsor cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted into law affecting the tax status of tennessee trusts the occurrence of such an event could cause distributions of interest income from the trust to be subject to the hall income tax investors should consult their own tax advisors in this regard it is assumed for purposes of the discussion and opinion below that the bonds constitute debt for federal income tax purposes in the opinion of special counsel to the trust under then existing tennessee state law and based on the assumptions set forth above for purposes of the hall income tax the tennessee excise tax imposed by section  the state corporate income tax and the tennessee franchise tax imposed by section  the tennessee trust will not be subject to such taxes for hall income tax purposes a proportionate share of such distributions from the tennessee trust to unitholders to the extent attributable to interest on the tennessee bonds based on the relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to tennessee bonds will be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to such unitholders based on the commissioners letter distributions from the tennessee trust to unitholders to the extent attributable to interest on the puerto rico bonds based on the relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to the puerto rico bonds will be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to such unitholders a proportionate share of distributions from the tennessee trust attributable to assets other than the bonds would not under current law be exempt from the hall income tax when distributed to unitholders for state corporate income tax purposes tennessee law does not provide an exemption for interest on tennessee bonds and requires that all interest excludable from federal gross income must be included in calculating net earnings subject to the state corporate income tax no opinion is expressed regarding whether such tax would be imposed on the earnings or distributions of the tennessee trust including interest on the bonds or gain realized upon the disposition of the bonds by the tennessee trust attributable to unitholders subject to the state corporate income tax however based upon prior written advice from the tennessee department of revenue earnings and distributions from the tennessee trust including interest on the tennessee bonds or gain realized upon the disposition of the tennessee bonds by the tennessee trust attributable to the unitholders should be exempt from the state corporate income tax the position of the tennessee department of revenue is not binding and is subject to change even on a retroactive basis each unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for state corporate income tax purposes when the unitholder redeems or sells his units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion or any discount or amortization of any premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the tennessee trust if later tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in unitholders realizing taxable gain when the units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost for purposes of the tennessee property tax the tennessee trust will be exempt from taxation with respect to the bonds it holds as for the taxation of the units held by the unitholders although intangible personal property is not presently subject to tennessee taxation no opinion is expressed with regard to potential property taxation of the unitholders with respect to the units because the determination of whether property is exempt from such tax is made on a county by county basis no opinion is expressed herein regarding whether insurance proceeds paid in lieu of interest on the bonds held by the tennessee trust including the tennessee bonds are exempt from the hall income tax distributions of such proceeds to unitholders may be subject to the hall income tax the bonds and the units held by the unitholder will not be subject to tennessee sales and use taxes neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler llp have examined any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the tennessee trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from state income taxes of interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder it is assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition it is assumed that with respect to the tennessee bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from the income taxes imposed and with respect to the puerto rico bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and local income taxation of the puerto rico bonds and the interest thereon neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the tennessee trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith chapman and cutler llp has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of tennessee law ownership of the units may result in collateral tennessee tax consequences to certain taxpayers prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences texas risk factors the financial condition of the state of texas is affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the texas labor force is concentrated in oil and gas extraction pipelines and petroleum production these industries tend to be highly cyclical texass largest industries in terms of earnings have traditionally been services government and trade there is no assurance that these industries will continue to grow the state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning texas risk factors may be obtained upon request to the sponsor as described in additional information tax status at the time of the closing for each texas trust special counsel to the fund for texas tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing texas income taw law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to texas income taxation substantially to the effect that  neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state currently imposes an income tax on individuals therefore no portion of any distribution received by an individual unitholder of the trust in respect of his units including a distribution of the proceeds of insurance in respect of such units is subject to income taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state  except in the case of certain transportation businesses savings and loan associations and insurance companies no unit of the trust is taxable under any property tax levied in the state  the inheritance tax of the state imposed upon certain transfers of property of a deceased resident individual unitholder may be measured in part upon the value of units of the trust included in the estate of such unitholder and  with respect to any unitholder which is subject to the state corporate franchise tax units in the trust held by such unitholder and distributions received therein will be taken into account in computing the taxable capital of the unitholder allocated to the state one of the bases by which such franchise tax is currently measured the other being a corporations net capital earned surplus which is generally its net corporate income plus officers and directors income the opinion set forth in clause  above is limited to the extent that units of the trust may be subject to property taxes levied in the state if held on the relevant date i by a transportation business described in vtca tax code subchapter a chapter  ii by a savings and loan association formed under the laws of the state but only to the extent described in section  of the texas savings and loan act vernons ann civ st art a or iii by an insurance company incorporated under the laws of the state but only to the extent described in vats insurance code art  each unitholder described in the preceding sentence should consult its own tax advisor with respect to such matters corporations subject to the state franchise tax should be aware that in its first called  session the texas legislature adopted and the governor has signed into law certain substantial amendments to the state corporate franchise tax the effect of which may be to subject to taxation all or a portion of any gains realized by such a corporate unitholder upon the sale exchange or other disposition of a unit the amendments are applicable to taxable periods commencing january  and to each taxable period thereafter because no authoritative judicial legislative or administrative interpretation of these amendments has been issued and there remain many unresolved questions regarding its potential effect on corporate franchise taxpayers each corporation which is subject to the state franchise tax and which is considering the purchase of units should consult its tax advisor regarding the effect of these amendments virginia risk factors the financial condition of the commonwealth of virginia is affected by various national economic social and

materially affect the commonwealths governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning virginia risk factors may be obtained

by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds and collectively with the virginia bonds the bonds neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held

income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities ii the interest thereon is excludible from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii the interest thereon is exempt from income tax imposed by virginia that is applicable to individuals and corporations the virginia income tax and with respect to the possession bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and local taxation the opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of virginia in the opinion of special counsel to the trust for virginia tax matters under then existing law and based upon the assumptions set forth above  the virginia trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes of the virginia income tax and each unitholder of the trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the assets held by the trust and the income of such portion of the virginia trust will be treated as income of the unitholder for purposes of the virginia income tax  interest on the virginia bonds which is exempt from virginia income tax when received by the virginia trust and which would be exempt from virginia income tax if received directly by a unitholder will retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the trust and distributed to such unitholder  interest on the possession bonds which is excludible from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the trust will be exempt from virginia income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the unitholder for virginia income tax purposes when distributed by the trust and received by the unitholders  the virginia legislature has enacted a law effective july   that would exempt from the virginia income tax income derived on the sale or exchange of obligations of the commonwealth of virginia or any political subdivision or instrumentality of the commonwealth of virginia however virginia law does not address whether this exclusion would apply to gains recognized through entities such as the virginia trust accordingly we express no opinion as to the treatment for virginia income tax purposes of any gain or loss recognized by a unitholder for federal income tax purposes  the virginia income tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the virginia trust to the extent that interest income related to the ownership of units is exempt from the virginia income tax in the case of unitholders subject to the virginia bank franchise tax the income derived by such a unitholder from his pro rata

an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described under portfolio in the related prospectus part i neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints acts of terrorism and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see federal tax status in prospectus part ii market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery to the extent any bonds are actually delivered to the fund after their respective expected dates of delivery unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their units for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the actual delivery of such bonds as a result of any such adjustment the estimated current returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year assuming the portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee which may be reduced in the first year only do not vary from that set forth in prospectus part i unitholders will be at risk with respect to all bonds in the portfolios including when as and if issued and delayed delivery bonds ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds from the date they commit for units certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved each trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions if any with respect to each of the debt obligations extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the fund or any of the trusts at any time after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in an insured trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such trust see the trustsobjectives and bond selection in prospectus part ii the portfolio insurers and the preinsured bond insurers are described under portfolio and notes to portfolio in prospectus part i the portfolio insurers if any are set forth in the prospectus an insurance policy obtained by an insured trust if any is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such trust see portfolio for the respective insured trust in prospectus part i any portfolio insurance premium for an insured trust which is an obligation of such trust is paid by such trust on a monthly basis nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by a policy obtained by an insured trust if any are fixed for the life of the trust the premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by such issuer by a prior owner of such bonds or the sponsor and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective preinsured bond insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due for the purposes of insurance obtained by an insured trust when due generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the affected portfolio insurer has the option in its sole discretion after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from the affected trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise the affected trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basis the insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by a trust insurance policy may be sold out of the affected trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to an insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that such trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if such trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if such trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default such trust would not need to hold such securities until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of such trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bonds not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii it is also the present intention of the trustee not to sell such bonds to effect redemptions or for any other reason but rather to retain them in the portfolio because value attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon sale see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds and bonds which have a significant risk of default insurance obtained by the issuer of a bond is effective so long as such bond is outstanding therefore any such insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the bonds thus insured but the exact effect if any of this insurance on such market value cannot be predicted the portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by an insured trust if any with respect to the bonds in such trust were issued by one or more of the portfolio insurers any other preinsured bond insurance policy or commitment therefor was issued by one of the preinsured bond insurers see the trustsobjectives and bond selection in prospectus part ii ambac assurance corporation ambac assurance effective july   ambac indemnity corporation changed its name to ambac assurance corporation any insurance policy of ambac assurance obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in the insurance policy are held by an insured trust a monthly premium is paid by an insured trust for an insurance policy obtained by it the trustee will pay when due successively the full amount of each installment of the insurance premium pursuant to a binding agreement with ambac assurance in the event of a sale of a bond covered by an ambac assurance insurance policy the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon

and governing the payment of dividends transactions with affiliates mergers consolidations acquisitions or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by one of the preinsured bond insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such trust in determining eligibility for insurance the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured either by the respective trust or by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust is to obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such trust than would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had standard  poors aaa rating and yet at the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and principal when due on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved preinsured bonds in an insured trust all of which are rated aaa by standard  poors may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by standard  poors in selecting such bonds for an insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond a portfolio insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the portfolio insurers and the preinsured bond insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned the internal revenue service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds under policy provisions substantially identical to the policies described herein will be excludable from federal gross income under section a of the internal revenue code to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations holders of units in an insured trust should discuss with their tax advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling however chapman and cutler llp counsel for the sponsor has given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under federal tax status in prospectus part ii each portfolio insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that each portfolio insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some time in the future at the date hereof it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the portfolio insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance the information relating to each portfolio insurer has been furnished by such companies the financial information with respect to each portfolio insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities no representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the supervisor as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the supervisor in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of bonds upon default in payment of principal or interest institution of certain legal proceedings default under other documents adversely affecting debt service default in payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors including advance refunding ie the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective redemption dates so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders in connection with the insured trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds the overall quality of the bonds remaining in such trusts portfolio will tend to diminish except as described in this section and in certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the trustee to be in the best interests of the unitholders or if there is no alternative the trustee is not empowered to sell bonds from an insured trust which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value has been attributed for the insurance obtained by such insured trust because of restrictions on the trustee under certain circumstances the sponsor may seek a full or partial suspension of the right of unitholders to redeem their units in an insured trust see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in prospectus part ii the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any obligation so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder of the trust thereby affected identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor except as stated herein and under fund administrationreplacement bonds in prospectus part ii regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred sponsor information van kampen funds inc is the sponsor of the trusts van kampen funds inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of van kampen investments inc van kampen

outstanding or by the trustee when the value of such trust as shown by any semiannual evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of bonds a trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the underwriters including the sponsor so that the net worth of such trust would be reduced to less than  of the initial principal amount of such trust if a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the underwriters the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge

shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner notwithstanding the foregoing in connection with final distributions to unitholders of an insured trust it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust is applicable only while bonds so insured are held by such trust the price to be received by such trust upon the disposition of any such bond which is in default by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest will not reflect any value based on such insurance therefore in connection with any liquidation it shall not be necessary for the trustee to and the trustee does not currently intend to dispose of any bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds until due shall be deemed to be in the best interest of unitholders including but not limited to situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from a significant risk of default since the preinsured bonds will reflect the value of the related insurance it is the present intention of the sponsor not to direct the trustee to hold any of such preinsured bonds after the date of termination all proceeds received less applicable expenses from insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be distributed to unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the trustee description of ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond this assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price the ratings are based on current information furnished to standard  poors by the issuer and obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the bond in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings a provisional rating p assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise his own judgement with respect to such likelihood and risk moodys investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payment and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well moodysr applies numerical modifiers   and  in each generic rating classification from aa through b in its corporate bond rating system the modifier  indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category arizona risk factors economic condition and outlook in comparison to the original forecast released in april  the economy in arizona is projected to grow at a faster rate over the forecast period from  to  for  the projected growth rate has been increased to  percent and for  the projected pace of expansion is  percent the revised nonfarm job increase for  to  is  jobs in comparison to the original forecast with a gain of  jobs not only is the overall economy anticipated to grow at a faster rate as demonstrated in the nonfarm job figures but most industries are projected to grow at a more rapid pace the projections are being revised upwards because of stronger than anticipated strength in the arizona economy strong population growth in the state has bolstered major industries such as construction trade financial activities leisure and hospitality educational and health services and government economic growth in the rest of the nation and other parts of the world has also helped to strengthen the states economy productivity enhancements from automation and information technology have contributed to this overall economic improvement an improving domestic economy has persuaded businesses to increase their spending this increased spending has also contributed to accelerating the economy rapid economic growth in other parts of the world such as china has increased demand for many globally traded commodities such as copper and therefore has resulted in rising prices higher copper prices have resulted in expansion in the metal ores sector of the natural resources and mining industry continued us military operations abroad have bolstered employment in the aerospace products and parts sector of durable goods manufacturing strong construction activity has bolstered another durable goods manufacturing sector fabricated metal products the economy will continue to grow over the forecast period despite rising costs for energy health care and interest rates because incomes are expected to increase at a faster rate than costs rising interest rates will make consumer debt service more expensive and home mortgages less affordable the removal of equity from the refinancing of home mortgages with rising housing prices has placed more money in the hands of consumers and has contributed to continued growth of consumer spending however housing price growth is expected to slow as interest rates rise and therefore slow equity removal and mortgage refinance activity higher health care and energy costs will absorb consumer disposable income and leave less money to be spent on other goods and services these rising costs will slow rather than stop the current economic expansion the current economic expansion could potentially be halted if the costs of interest rates energy and health care increase past a certain point where they absorbed a majority of consumer disposable income while not leaving enough funds to be spent on other items rising interest rates a special concern will make servicing high levels of consumer and federal government debt more expensive and crowd out other types of spending construction is now projected to have an increase of  jobs over the forecast period the revised projected growth rate for  is  percent which slows to  percent for  in contrast the original set of projections had a gain of  jobs population growth and the corresponding need to expand infrastructure are expected to drive growth in construction manufacturing is forecast to add  jobs for an

forecast to add  jobs in  and  for an expansion rate of  percent in  and  percent in  the original projections set called for an increase of  jobs transportation warehousing and utilities is a part of the economy where rising energy costs have caused a downward revision to growth in comparison to the original forecast the revised set of projections has this sector adding  jobs for a growth rate of  percent in  and  percent in  however the original forecast called for an increase of  jobs the primary reason for the reduced growth rate especially in transportation is higher than originally anticipated fuel prices information is following the trend of transportation warehousing and utilities with downwardly revised forecast figures the revised job losses have deepened to  jobs over the twoyear period in contrast to a much smaller loss of  jobs in the original forecast the reason for the downward revision is a deeper and longer than anticipated consolidation process in the telecommunications sector professional and business services is expected to add  jobs an expansion rate of  percent in  and  percent in  the original set of projection figures called for an increase

increase of  jobs or a pace of expansion of  percent in  and  percent in  the original forecast set the expansion to be an increase of  jobs growth projections for health care have been decreased because of the dampening effects of rapidly rising health care costs and shortages of workers in skilled occupations while the slowing growth of the school age population especially children in the primary and secondary school categories has reduced the growth pace in educational and social services the revised projections for other services are unchanged from the original with an addition of  jobs for a growth rate of  percent in  and  percent in  overall the remainder of  and  will be good for arizonas economy with strong job growth in most industries information is the only exception with anticipated accelerating losses the factors of concern are rising interest and energy costs because if these two costs increase fast enough then they have the potential to significantly slow down

overall farm income each year the state is now moving toward a heavier manufacturing base involving more sophisticated processes and products such as electrical machinery transportation equipment fabricated metals and electronics in fact arkansas now has a higher percentage of workers involved in manufacturing than the national average the diversification of economic interests has lessened the states cyclical sensitivity to impact by any single sector the states work force and other factors continue to attract investment in manufacturing as well as other factors to the state in  wage and salary employment rose to  jobs this represented an increase of  jobs or  percent compared to  in  wage and salary employment is estimated to grow to  jobs this represents an increase of  jobs or  percent from  the  forecast for gross general revenue is  million an increase of  million or  percent over  in fiscal year  actual net available general revenues collected totaled  million of which  million was distributed to state agencies and  million surplus was deposited to the general revenue allotment reserve fund this amount is  million or  percent above the net available collections of fiscal year  the general revenue distribution included an estimated  million from a  percent income tax surcharge which will expire for tax years beginning january   and a transfer of  million from the property tax relief trust fund fiscal year  net available general revenue collections are estimated at  a decrease of  million or  percent over fiscal year  with distribution to state agencies of  million an increase of  million or  increase this would provide an estimated  million surplus to be deposited to the general revenue allotment reserve fund for appropriation in the  legislative session the net available general revenues distributed for fiscal year  are estimated to include  million from the property tax relief trust fund revenue decreases from expiration of the  percent income tax surcharge and elimination of the arkansas estate tax are estimated at  million and  million respectively major initiatives in  the arkansas state highway and transportation department ahtd

information it is based in part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in arkansas or contained in official statements for various arkansas municipal obligations california risk factors economic outlook the real estate market was an important engine of economic growth in  for both the nation and california in california jobs closely related to the real estate market namely construction and financial activities accounted for about  of jobs created in  low mortgage interest rates fueled growth in the real estate sector by the fall of  however home sales were beginning to slow and inventory was growing by january  residential real estate sales in california dropped by  below the rate for january  home prices began to level off as the year ended but the january  median price was still  above the level of january  personal income growth in california has been more robust than that of payroll employment personal income for californians was  higher in the third quarter of  as compared to the third quarter of  although lower than the  growth rate in  total employment is growing at a faster pace than payroll employment in california industries thus boosting personal income growth more workers are earning their income as contractors selfemployed or small business owners state personal income tax collections through january  are up  from last year due in part to the resurgence in capital gains from the real estate market and the stock market because taxes on personal income are progressive that is the rate of taxation increases as taxable income increases income gains by highincome taxpayers result in greater amounts collected in taxes the state experienced healthy increases in general revenues primarily personal income corporate and sales tax revenues and stabilized its expenses as a result for the first time in the past four fiscal years state revenues exceeded expenses and transfers for governmental activities total revenues for the states businesstype activities also exceeded expenses for the year therefore net assets for the  fiscal year for both governmental and businesstype activities increased by  over last year net assets the primary governments net assets as of june   were  billion after the total net assets are reduced by  billion for investment in capital assets net of related debt and by  billion for restricted net assets the resulting unrestricted net assets were a negative  billion restricted net assets are dedicated for specified uses and are not available to fund current activities more than half of the negative  billion consists of  billion in outstanding bonded debt issued to build capital assets for school districts and other local governmental entities the bonded debt reduces the unrestricted net assets however local governments instead of the state record the capital assets that would offset this reduction changes in net assets the primary governments total net assets increased by  billion  during the year ended june   net assets of governmental activities increased by  billion  while net assets of businesstype activities increased by  billion  the california economy picked up speed in fiscal year  and by the end of the fiscal year had regained all of the jobs lost since the  recession from june  to june  nonfarm payroll employment added  jobs representing an annual growth rate of  more than twice as fast as in the previous fiscal year income growth was also strong getting a significant boost from both job growth and capital gains despite shortterm interest rate increases from the federal open market committee mortgage rates remained low and the real estate market continued its upsurge home sales and prices reached record levels and residential construction activity was strong while professional and business services added more jobs  than any other single sector construction gained a reported  jobs together construction and financial activities provided  of the job growth in the fiscal year the us economy continued its expansion in  gross domestic product gdp growth for the year averaged  in august and september of  the gulf coast of the us was hit by two major hurricanes that significantly damaged the lives and property of people in that region oil and gas facilities were extensively damaged significantly raising energy prices many feared that the nation would fall into recession however the economy continued to grow in the wake of the hurricanes gdp grew  in the third quarter before slowing to  in the fourth quarter of  this slowing was at least partially due to the storms the hurricanes slowed exports and accelerated imports as the nation replaced lost capacity at home with petroleum products and other goods from abroad payroll employment growth in calendar year  was approximately  for the nation and  for california the nation added almost  million jobs and california added approximately  jobs by the end of december  the unemployment rate in california had dropped to  compared to  in december of  the national unemployment rate in december  was  in january  payroll employment in the nation grew by  jobs and in california by  jobs the unemployment rate dropped to  in the nation and  in california this was the lowest unemployment rate in california since march  jobs in construction which was the leading source of employment gains for california in the prior  months showed a decline in january infrastructure planning recent disastrous flooding in the southern united states has heightened awareness of the urgent need to shore up the states central valley levee system much of the existing levee system needs substantial rehabilitation the state department of water resources has estimated a cost of  to  billion for restoring the central valley flood control systems aging levees to the level of protection for which they were originally designed in the future the state will likely incur much higher costs to adequately protect the valleys expanding urban regions the governor has proposed a strategic growth plan that looks to invest more than  billion in infrastructure over a year period five areas targeted for investment are transportation and air quality education flood control and water supply public safety and court and other public service projects although the creation of an infrastructure bond plan has been discussed no specific plan has been finalized budget outlook the  budget act was enacted on july   and authorizes total spending of  billion  billion from the general fund  billion from special funds and  billion from bond funds total general fund resources and expenditures in this budget are projected to be  billion and  billion respectively the budget contains a  billion increase for education kindergarten through th grade and community college funding prepays a  billion loan due to local governments in  and reflects program savings of approximately  billion the governors budget for the  fiscal year released on january   seeks total spending of  billion  billion from the general fund  billion from special funds and  billion from bond funds total general fund resources including transfers are projected to be  billion while expenditures are estimated at  billion the proposed  general fund expenditures represent a  billion increase over the  enacted budget amounts the governors budget also calls for the prepayment of  million of the  billion owed to transportation funds in  for the first time as required by proposition  approved by california voters in march  a transfer of  million will be made to the newly created budget stabilization account half of the transfer to the account serves to retire  million in deficit financing bonds and the remainder stays in the account as a reserve the legislative analysts office lao californias nonpartisan fiscal and policy advisor notes that the governors budget would leave the state with major structural budget shortfalls and a large amount of other outstanding financial obligations the lao also recommends that the legislature reduce ongoing spending increases proposed in the governors budget and use onetime stronger than normal revenues to pay down more of the outstanding budgetary debt or hold some of these revenues in reserve debt management plan as part of the strategic debt management plan adopted in the  fiscal year the state deferred for up to four years the initial principal payments on new and refunding general obligation bonds issued through june   some of these deferred initial principal payments became due during the year ended june   also the initial principal payment became due this year for the federal highway grant anticipation revenue vehicles garvee bonds issued last year debt administration at june   the primary government had total bonded debt outstanding of  billion of this amount  billion  represents general obligation bonds which are backed by the full faith and credit of the state included in the  billion of general obligation bonds is  billion of economic recovery bonds that are secured by a pledge of revenues derived from dedicated sales and use taxes the current portion of general obligation bonds outstanding is  billion and the longterm portion is  billion the remaining  billion  of bonded debt outstanding represents revenue bonds which are secured solely by specified revenue sources the current portion of revenue bonds outstanding is  billion and the longterm portion is  billion the primary governments total longterm obligations increased during the year ended june   the main reason for the increase was the issuance of  billion in general obligation bonds and  billion in revenue bonds however the increase due to bond issuances was offset by an increase in general obligation and revenue bond retirement payments made during the year budgetary control the states annual budget is prepared primarily on a modified accrual basis for governmental funds the governor recommends a budget for approval by the legislature each year this recommended budget includes estimated revenues however revenues are not included in the annual budget bill adopted by the legislature under state law the state cannot adopt a spending plan that exceeds estimated revenues under the state constitution money may be drawn from the treasury only through a legal appropriation the appropriations contained in the budget act as approved by the legislature and signed by the governor are the primary sources of annual expenditure authorizations and establish the legal level of control at the appropriation level for the annual operating budget the budget can be amended throughout the year by special legislative action budget revisions by the department of finance or executive orders of the governor appropriations are generally available for expenditure or encumbrance either in the year appropriated or for a period of three years if the legislation does not specify a period of availability at the end of the availability period the encumbering authority for the unencumbered balance lapses some appropriations continue indefinitely while others are available until fully spent generally encumbrances must be liquidated within two years from the end of the period when the appropriation is available if the encumbrances are not liquidated within this additional twoyear period the spending authority for these encumbrances lapses state agencies are responsible for exercising basic budgetary control and ensuring that appropriations are not overspent the state controllers office is responsible for overall appropriation control and does not allow expenditures in excess of authorized appropriations financial activities are mainly controlled at the appropriation level but can vary depending on the presentation and wording contained in the budget act certain items that are established at the category program component or element level can be adjusted by the department of finance for example an appropriation for support may have detail accounts for personal services operating expenses and equipment and reimbursements the department of finance can authorize adjustments between the detail accounts but cannot increase the amount of the overall support appropriation while the financial activities are controlled at various levels the legal level of budgetary control or the extent to which management may amend the budget without seeking approval of the governing body has been established in the budget act at the appropriation level for the annual operating budget cash management cash temporarily idle during the year is invested in the pooled money investment account pmia investment of pmia moneys is restricted by law to the following categories us government securities securities of federally sponsored agencies domestic corporate bonds bank notes interestbearing time deposits in california banks and savings and loan associations prime commercial paper repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements security loans bankers acceptances negotiable certificates of deposit

june   the total earnings of the pmia for the year ended june   amounted to  billion which was distributed as follows  million to the general fund  million to special funds  million to local governments  million to calpers and  million to calstrs the states cash management program for the general fund regularly issues shortterm obligations to meet cash flow needs the state issues revenue anticipation notes rans to partially fund timing differences between revenues and expenditures a significant portion of the general fund revenues are received in the second half of the fiscal year while disbursements are paid more evenly throughout the fiscal year if additional external cash flow borrowing is required the state issues revenue anticipation warrants raws risk management the primary government has elected with a few exceptions to be selfinsured against loss or liability and generally does not maintain reserves losses are covered by appropriations in the year in which the payment occurs the discounted liability for unpaid selfinsured workers compensation losses is estimated to be  billion as of june   proposed budget  the governor released his proposed budget on january   the  proposed spending plan totals  billion this spending plan represents estimated general fund expenditures of  billion special fund expenditures of  billion and bond fund expenditures of  billion proposed general fund expenditures are  higher than the  billion expenditures estimated for the  fiscal year the governors budget projects to end the  fiscal year with a  million reserve including  million in the budget stabilization account proposition  passed by californias voters in november  requires that beginning in the  fiscal year the state transfer into the budget stabilization account by september  of each year a specified portion of estimated general fund revenues until the account balance reaches  billion or  of the estimated general fund revenues whichever is greater in the  overview of the governors budget the legislative analysts office californias nonpartisan fiscal and policy advisor expresses concerns about using unexpected revenue increases from volatile revenue sources  such as business profits and capital gains  to increase spending instead of paying down outstanding obligations such as past borrowings from schools local governments and transportation given the continuing structural budget shortfall when annual expenses exceed annual revenues and an estimated  billion of potential unbudgeted costs the legislative analyst cautions the legislature about taking on new and ongoing program commitments at this time ratings as of september  all outstanding general obligation bonds of the state of california are rated a by standard  poors

california municipal obligations colorado risk factors general colorado became the thirtyeighth state of the united states of america when it was admitted to the union in  its borders encompass  square miles of the high plains and the rocky mountains with elevations ranging from  to  feet above sea level the states major economic sectors include agriculture manufacturing technology tourism energy production and mining considerable economic activity is generated in support of these sectors by government wholesale and retail trade transportation communications public utilities finance insurance real estate and other services given the states semiarid climate water resource development allocation and conservation are ongoing issues for state management the state maintains a separation of powers utilizing three branches of government  executive legislative and judicial the executive branch comprises four major elected officials  governor state treasurer attorney general and secretary of state most departments of the state report directly to the governor however the departments of treasury law and state report to their respective elected officials and the department of education reports to the elected state board of education the elected officials serve fouryear terms with the number of terms limited in duration the legislature is bicameral and comprises thirtyfive senators and sixtyfive representatives who are also term limited it is a citizen legislature whose general session lasts  days beginning in january of each year special sessions may be called by the governor at his discretion and are limited to the topics identified by the governor the legislatures otherwise plenary power is checked by the requirement for the governors signature of its legislation and by specific limitations placed in the state constitution by voters the most significant fiscal limitation is the restriction related to issuing debt raising taxes and changing existing spending limits from a fiscal perspective the joint budget committee of the legislature because of its preparation of the annual budget and supplemental appropriations bills holds the most important power vested in the legislature the committee is bipartisan with members drawn from each of the houses of the legislature the governors office of state planning and budgeting develops an executive branch budget proposal but there is no requirement for the joint budget committee to adopt that proposal the judicial branch is responsible for resolving disputes within the state including those between the executive and legislative branches of government and for supervising offenders on probation the branch includes the supreme court court of appeals and district and county courts served by  justices and judges in  judicial districts across the state excluding  denver county court judges municipal courts are not part of the state system there are also seven water courts one in each of the major river basins the judicial branch budget is appropriated by the legislature and it is funded primarily from generalpurpose revenues of the general fund economic outlook the states general fund revenue picture continued to rebound in fiscal year  general fund revenues were  million  percent over the prior year amount however those revenues remained  million  percent below the fiscal year  record level the generalpurpose revenue growth parallels the reported  state personal income growth of  percent it also reflects a beginning recovery in state employment as  jobs were added in fiscal year  and employment increased  percent in august   the tenth highest rate of increase in the nation the states recovery from the most recent recession follows the national recovery although the state has recovered more slowly inflation adjusted national gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of  percent in calendar  and in the third quarter of  it grew at a  percent annual rate over the third quarter of  national personal consumption expenditures which account for twothirds of gdp and were up  percent outpaced the thirdquarter to thirdquarter average while private domestic investment including nonresidential structures equipment and software residential and changes in inventories lagged the average at  percent government spending also lagged the average at a  percent growth rate and was primarily the result of slower growth in state and local government spending federal spending while increasing also lagged the thirdquarter to thirdquarter average growth rate inflation in colorado was extremely low in  with consumer prices rising only  percent inflation remained low through august  with prices up only  percent colorado inflation was controlled primarily by reductions in housing rental rates and incentives offered by automobile dealers the highwage jobs lost in the  recession have also mitigated inflation pressures as the job recovery has been slow since that time a change in the method of computing the unemployment rate increased the  percentage to  percent from  percent calculated under the old method however unemployment is forecast to decline in fiscal year  as job growth continues after two successive years of decline housing permits increased  percent in  while the value of nonresidential construction increased  percent colorados economic difficulties in fiscal years  through  have continued to affect net migration in calendar year  net inmigration declined from approximately  and  in  and  respectively to approximately  in both  and  however the  amount includes international inmigration of approximately  and outmigration to other states of around  this pattern likely results in replacing established households that have a high level of economic activity with new households that have a lower level of economic activity capital assets and longterm debt activity the states investment in capital assets at june   was  billion  billion in fiscal year  included in this amount were  billion of depreciable capital assets net of  billion of depreciation also included was  billion of land and nondepreciable infrastructure reported under the modified approach the state added  million and  million of capital assets in fiscal year  and  respectively of the fiscal year  additions  million was recorded by governmental funds and  million was recorded by proprietary funds of the additions  million was funded by generalpurpose revenues and the balance was funded by federal funds cash funds or borrowing the state continued construction of a major project to rebuild a portion of interstate  in denver the project increases the capacity and efficiency of the highway and adds a light rail line the project is funded by transportation revenue anticipation notes trans authorized by a vote of the people in the november  election the state will repay the notes from future federal and other state revenues conditions expected to affect future operations several conditions adversely affect the states future operations first there has been a very significant change related to previously anticipated taxpayers bill of rights tabor refunds over the next five years in a bipartisan agreement between the legislature and the governor two referenda were placed on the november  election ballot voters approved one of the referenda by a narrow margin and rejected the other the approved referendum known as referendum c allows the state to retain all revenues in excess of the tabor limits from fiscal year  through fiscal year  at the time of the vote legislative council estimated the retained revenues at  billion the election did not guarantee the availability of those funds but rather it allowed the state to keep and spend those dollars if they are realized through existing taxes fees and other sources subject to the tabor limits the defeated referendum known as referendum d would have allowed the state to borrow  billion in anticipation of the revenues to be retained under referendum c it specified the use of the debt proceeds to fund transportation fire and police pensions primary education buildings and higher education buildings the rejection of referendum d means that many of the items cited in this discussion in fiscal year  continue to be conditions that are expected to affect future operations an existing statute provides for diversion of generalpurpose sales tax revenue to the highway fund when other general fund obligations have been met another statute provides that any general fund surplus be distributed to the highway fund and capital projects fund in a twothirds and onethird ratio respectively with the passage of referendum c ospb currently estimates that  million will be sent to the highway fund between fiscal years  and  under these statutes even if none of this amount is used for debt service on the highway funds existing debt it will result in less new highway construction than would have occurred under the passage of referendum d in addition any new highway construction will be spread over five to eight years and will be reduced by any construction cost inflation occurring during that period second while one legislature cannot bind another current law requires the general fund to repay transfers from various cash funds when resources exceed general fund obligations third notwithstanding a  percent return on investments the funding ratio actuarial value of assets using a fouryear smoothedmarket value divided by actuarial accrued liability of the state and school division of the public employees retirement association pera declined from  percent to  percent within its most recent fiscal year this is down from a  percent funding ratio in  the amortization period for the plan is infinite which means that at the current contribution level the liability associated with existing benefits will never be fully paid the current contribution rate of  percent is  percentage points or  percent below the average during the s peras actuary estimates that the contribution rate would need to be  percent to achieve the year amortization period currently called for by the governmental accounting standards board several options have been offered to address the pera funding issues such as cutting benefits raising employee contributions or increasing employer contributions however each raises either legal political or budgetary issues fourth the election  amendment  constitutional requirement was originally designed to dedicate a portion of tabor refunds to education programs however resources that were once generalpurpose revenues continue to be diverted to the state education fund notwithstanding the passage of referendum c which eliminates tabor refunds for the following five years ospb estimates that  million will be diverted from generalpurpose tax revenue in fiscal year  under this requirement in addition the state is required to increase funding of education by specified percentages over inflation this requirement will have less of an impact in the near term than it has had historically because of the low level of inflation experienced by the state economy nonetheless this revenue diversion and mandated expenditure growth infringes on general funding for other programs because of the existing spending limits fifth for fiscal year  and following years the legislature changed the budgetary accounting for june payroll and medicaid expenditures to the cash basis this causes the outflow of resources to be deferred into the following year as a result the state does not use full or modified accrual accounting to calculate budgetary compliance instead potentially significant liabilities  million net of related deferred revenue in fiscal year  are delayed until the following year assuming that subsequent revenues will be adequate to pay those liabilities departures from generally accepted accounting principles gaap such as this could adversely affect the states credit rating it will be difficult for the state to return to the gaap basis of accounting for budgetary expenditures because of the significant onetime budgetary impact of recording payroll and medicaid expenditures that were previously deferred sixth the legislature temporarily reduced spending for fiscal year  payments to counties for the senior homestead property tax exemption were suspended reducing general fund expenditures these payments were also suspended for fiscal year  but are scheduled to resume at an estimated amount of  million in fiscal year  additionally payments to the fire and police pension association for old hire pension plans were suspended reducing general fund expenditures by an estimated  million these payments resume in fiscal year  seventh debt service payments on the remaining  billion of transportation revenue anticipation notes issued by the department of transportation average  million per year over the next five years while a portion of the debt services will be funded by federal funds a significant amount will be funded by state sources when most of the notes were issued the diversion of surplus generalpurpose revenues was expected to accumulate to fund that debt service due to the economic recession those diversions did not occur for several years as discussed above the diversion of general fund resources is expected to resume with the passage of referendum c nonetheless the use of federal and other transportation resources to pay this debt service will reduce the amount that can be expended on road maintenance and construction statewide major initiatives the legislature passed significant legislation to implement measures recently placed in the state constitution by voters and to address the fiscal impact of other voter approved constitutional requirements the legislation was generally of two types the first type was legislation that was immediately effective upon passage and signature by the governor the second type was legislation that was contingent on a vote of the people at the november

projects fund and the department of transportations portion of the highway users tax fund in developing the states accounting system consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls internal accounting controls are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance regarding the safeguarding of assets against loss from unauthorized use or disposition those controls also assure the reliability of financial records for preparing financial statements and maintaining the accountability for assets the concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived from that control the evaluation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management all internal control evaluations occur within this framework revenues and expenditures the state constitution requires that expenditures for any fiscal year not exceed revenues for such fiscal year by statute the amount of general fund revenues available for appropriation is based upon revenue estimates which together with other available resources must exceed annual appropriations by the amount of the unappropriated reserve the unappropriated reserve for fiscal years  and thereafter the unappropriated reserve requirement is set at  percent in addition to the unappropriated reserve a constitutional amendment approved by colorado voters in  requires the state and local government to reserve a certain percentage of its fiscal year spending excluding bonded debt service for emergency use the emergency reserve the minimum emergency reserve is set at  percent for  and later years for fiscal year  and thereafter general fund appropriations are also limited by statute to an amount equal to the cost of performing certain required reappraisals of taxable property plus an amount equal to the lesser of i  percent of colorado personal income or ii  percent of the total general fund appropriations for the previous fiscal year this restriction does not apply to any general fund appropriations which are required as a result of a new federal law a final state or federal court order or moneys derived from the increase in the rate or amount of any tax or fee approved by a majority of the registered electors of the state voting at any general election in addition the statutory limit on the level of general fund appropriations may be exceeded for a given fiscal year upon the declaration of a state fiscal emergency by the state general assembly on november   voters in colorado approved a constitutional amendment the amendment which in general became effective december   and restricts the ability of the state and local governments to increase revenues and impose taxes the amendment applies to the state and all local governments including home rule entities districts enterprises defined as governmentowned businesses authorized to issue revenue bonds and receiving under  percent of annual revenue in grants from all colorado state and local governments combined are excluded from the provisions of the amendment the provisions of the amendment are unclear and have required judicial interpretation among other provisions beginning november   the amendment requires voter approval prior to tax increases creation of debt or mill levy or valuation for assessment ratio increases the amendment also limits increases in government spending and property tax revenues to specified percentages the amendment requires that district property tax revenues yield no more than the prior years revenues adjusted for inflation voter approved changes and except with regard to school districts local growth in property values according to a formula set forth in the amendment school districts are allowed to adjust tax levies for changes in student enrollment pursuant to the amendment local government spending is to be limited by the same formula as the limitation for property tax revenues the basis for spending and revenue limits for each fiscal year is the prior fiscal years spending and property taxes collected in the prior calendar year debt service changes reductions and voterapproved revenue changes are excluded from the calculation bases the amendment also prohibits new or increased real property transfer tax rates new state real property taxes and local district income taxes there is also a statutory restriction on the amount of annual increases in taxes that the various taxing jurisdictions in colorado can levy without electoral approval this restriction does not apply to taxes levied to pay general obligation debt litigation concerning several issues relating to the amendment was filed in the colorado courts the litigation dealt with three principal issues i whether districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on general obligation bonds without obtaining voter approval ii whether a multiyear lease purchase agreement subject to annual appropriations is an obligation which requires voter approval prior to execution of the agreement and iii what constitutes an enterprise which is excluded from the provisions of the amendment in september  the colorado supreme court held that districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on general obligation bonds issued after the effective date of the amendment in june  the colorado supreme court validated mill levy increases to pay general obligation bonds issued prior to the amendment in late  the colorado court of appeals held that multiyear leasepurchase agreements subject to annual appropriation do not require voter approval finally in may  the colorado supreme court ruled that entities with the power to levy taxes may not themselves be enterprises for purposes of the amendment however the court did not address the issue of how valid enterprises may be created litigation in the enterprise arena may be filed in the future to clarify these issues tabor article x section  of the colorado state constitution limits the states revenue growth to the sum of inflation plus population growth in the previous calendar year according to the ospb after logging tabor revenue surpluses for five years the tabor surplus vanished in fy  and remained absent through fy  the tabor surplus disappeared because of the recession amendment  and the growth dividend in fy  the tabor surplus reappears totaling  million from fy  through the remainder of the forecast the tabor surplus is expected to range between  million and  million the september  ospb forecast for the fy  tabor surplus is slightly lower than was forecast in june  while the tabor surpluses in fy  and beyond are generally slightly higher there are several reasons for the change first tabor revenues received in fy  were higher than anticipated in june  permitting more of the growth dividend to be used in fy  this raises the fy  tabor limit which in turn lowers the amount of the fy  tabor surplus all things equal minor adjustments were also made to the fy  general fund and cash fund forecasts in light of the recent deceleration in national economic growth meanwhile exceptionally low inflation in  will result in a lower tabor limit in fy  the tabor surplus in fy  will thus increase governmental fund assets exceeded liabilities resulting in total fund balances of  million prior year  million of which  million prior year  million was reserved and the balance of  million prior year  million was unreserved in total governmental fund balances increased  million from the prior year primarily due to increases in other special revenue funds and other governmental funds the unreserved undesignated fund balance of the general fund was zero at both june   and june   because there were not adequate net assets to meet the statutorily required reserve on the generally accepted basis of accounting enterprise fund assets exceeded liabilities resulting in total net assets of  million prior year  million of which  million prior year  million was restricted or invested in capital assets and the balance of  million prior year  million was unrestricted the total increase of  million in enterprise fund net assets primarily occurred in the higher education institutions and unemployment insurance funds in fiscal year  state revenues subject to tabor were  million which was  million above the limit after the growth dividend and house bill  adjustments discussed above the  million is reported as a current liability on the fundlevel general fund balance sheet and the governmentwide statement of net assets most of the refund will be paid out between january and may of  without the growth dividend and the house bill  adjustments the fiscal year  refund would have been at least  million at the beginning of fiscal year  the university of colorado the brand board in the department of agriculture and the parking fund in the department of personnel  administration all became fully qualified tabor enterprises as fully qualified enterprises the revenues of these activities are not subject to the tabor revenue limits as required by tabor the state controller makes qualifications of enterprises neutral in the tabor calculations by removing the activities revenues from the base upon which the tabor limit is calculated in fiscal year  the base was reduced by  million related to enterprise qualifications under the requirements of current law the governors office of state planning and budgeting ospb estimates refunds growing from  million in fiscal year  to  million in fiscal year  however the legislature placed a referendum on the november  ballot allowing the state to retain the tabor refund during those years the voters approved the referendum and although the fiscal year  refund will be distributed in fiscal year  there will be no refunds made related to fiscal years  through  debt management under its constitution the state of colorado is not permitted to issue general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the state however certain agencies and instrumentalities of the state are authorized to issue bonds secured by revenues from specific projects and activities the state enters into certain lease transactions which are subject to annual renewal at the option of the state in addition the state is authorized to issue shortterm revenue anticipation notes local governmental units in the state are also authorized to incur indebtedness the major source of financing for such local government indebtedness is an ad valorem property tax in addition in order to finance public projects local governments in the state can issue revenue bonds payable from the revenues of a utility or enterprise or from the proceeds of an excise tax or assessment bonds payable from special assessments colorado local governments can also finance public projects through leases which are subject to annual appropriation at the option of the local government local governments in colorado also issue tax anticipation notes the amendment requires prior voter approval for the creation of any multiple fiscal year debt or other financial obligation whatsoever except for refundings at a lower rate or obligations of an enterprise the state has issued certificates of participation cops secured by buildings and vehicles and revenue bonds that are secured by pledges of future revenues in some instances the debtfinanced asset generates the pledged revenue stream in other instances such as the trans the pledged revenue stream is future federal revenues and state taxes the state has other forms of borrowing that are small in relation to the revenue bonds and cops in fiscal year  the total principal amount of revenue bonds and cops was  percent of net asset other than capital assets in fiscal year  that measure increased to  percent because debt principal increased more than did noncapital net assets on a proportional basis total per capita debt including bonds certificate of participation mortgages notes and leases was  per person in fiscal year   per person in fiscal year  and it rose to  per person in fiscal year  except for exempt enterprises the tabor amendment requires a vote of the people for the creation of any debt unless existing cash reserves are irrevocably pledged to service the debt the amendment does allow debt issuance to refinance a borrowing at a lower interest rate these requirements limit managements ability to address revenue shortfalls by borrowing for capital expenditures risk management the state selfinsures its agencies officials and employees against the risk of loss related to general liability motor vehicle liability and workers compensation property claims are not

makeup of its workers with manufacturing jobs being replaced by service sector jobs this is a trend that began several decades ago in   percent of connecticut workers were employed in manufacturing by  this number stood at  percent conversely service sector employment rose from  percent to  percent of the workforce during this period the diversification of connecticuts workforce has helped to mitigate the economic consequences of declines in specific industries such as defense despite these shifts manufacturing continues to play an important role in connecticuts economic life contributing

vibrant export sector with export growth of  percent in  and  percent in  exports contribute just over  percent to gross state product connecticuts unemployment rate was  percent at the end of fiscal year  compared to a national rate of  percent after a slight rise at the beginning of fiscal year  the states unemployment rate dropped back to  percent in october  one reason for the states relatively low unemployment rate is stagnation in its labor force growth between fiscal years  and  connecticuts labor force actually declined slightly nationally during this period the labor force was growing at an annual average rate of  percent reversing the trend of a declining state labor force will prove important to connecticuts longterm economic growth potential a slight acceleration in

either the fiveyear average annual growth in the states personal income or inflation whichever is higher debt service payments certain statutory grants to distressed municipalities and appropriations required by federal mandate or court order are excluded from the limits of the cap the spending cap can be lifted if the governor declares the existence of extraordinary circumstances and the general

administration to earmark a portion of any yearend surplus to replenish the brtf in order to achieve the desired balance to that end and as authorized by house bill  we are increasing the brtf by  for a total of  beginning with fy  major initiatives in march  the general assembly enacted the commonwealths  biennial budget for the executive branch when meeting in regular session prior to that time the executive branch of government had operated under quarterly public services continuation plans promulgated at the beginning of each fiscal quarter this was the second consecutive biennium that the general assembly did not pass an executive branch budget on time the quarterly public services continuation plans represented a continuation of current levels of activity exclusive for the operating budget the franklin county circuit court ruled that no capital projects could move forward without an enacted budget the circuit court also ruled that the spending plan could not include spending on new programs or an amount for existing programs greater than the general assembly approved in its last budget outside of these requirements the circuit court did not issue an injunction barring the executive branch from implementing the quarterly public services continuation plans and ruled that the spending plans expire at the end of the fiscal year absent legislative action in october  governor fletcher called the general assembly into special session to address funding for the public health insurance program which covers state employees local school district employees and public retirees the general assembly appropriated funds for this purpose as well as funds for the state school system in march  the  session of the general assembly enacted the remainder of the executive branch budget within the budget bill the general assembly ratified all of the actions the executive branch took pursuant to the public services continuation plans one of the more notable initiatives in the budget was the unprecedented size of the capital programs financed mainly through the issuance of debt education spending held the highest priority in the budget it was increased by  percent and the postsecondary education budget was increased by  percent the capital budget for the executive branch included  in bond funded capital projects exclusive of road and bridge construction including  supported from general fund debt service with the remainder  to be financed with agencyrestricted fund debt service the largest proportion of new project activity including bondfinanced activity was directed to postsecondary education these efforts reflect support for the top capital construction priorities at each of the eight public universities and the kentucky community and technical college system kctcs the second largest commitment of support is for local school construction which was previously authorized and encouraged but not fully funded the school facilities construction commission sfcc which aids local school districts in new construction and renovation projects received  million in new bonds from the  general assembly to support offers of assistance to local school districts the general assembly also enacted tax modernization legislation the jobs for kentucky program the tax bill was revenue neutral over a fiveyear period the legislation included a

branch may only expend funds in certain instances among which were constitutional mandates authorized bonded indebtedness statutorily based appropriations and federal mandates the commonwealth ended fy  with a surplus in the general fund of  million including the budget reserve trust fund and  million in the transportation fund the general fund surplus was due to higher revenue receipts than anticipated combined with the lapse of unexpended funds the transportation fund surplus was mostly the result of the lapse of unexpended funds governor fletcher devoted  million of the general fund surplus the maximum allowed by the budget bill to the commonwealths budget reserve trust fund or rainy day fund assets the commonwealths combined net assets governmental and businesstype activities totaled  billion at the end of  as compared to  billion at the end of the previous year at  billion the largest portion of the commonwealths net assets is invested in capital assets eg land infrastructures buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding the commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide services to its citizens therefore these assets are not available for future spending the second largest portion of the commonwealths net assets totaling  billion is restricted and represents resources that are subject to either external restrictions or legislative restrictions on how they may be used the remaining balance is unrestricted net assets the unrestricted net assets which if positive could be used at the commonwealths discretion showed a negative balance of  billion therefore no funds were available for discretionary purposes a contributing factor to the negative balance is that liabilities are recognized on the governmentwide statement of net assets when the obligation is incurred accordingly the commonwealth recognizes longterm liabilities such as general bonded debt compensated absences unfunded employer pension cost and contingent liabilitiesshown in note  to the financial statements on the statement of net assets debt administration the authority of the commonwealth to incur debt is described in article x section  of the kentucky constitution in  the commonwealth created the executive bond oversight commission and the legislative bond oversight commission the commissions meet jointly to review all proposed debt issuance both commissions must approve each financing plan before obligations are issued the legislation that created the bond oversight commissions also created the position of commonwealth bond advisor who advises the commissions and must approve the pricing and fees associated with any debt issuance the commonwealth of kentuckys bonded debt increased by  million to  a  increase during the current fiscal year no general obligation bonds were authorized or outstanding at june   the key factor in this increase was the

rise about  basis points the state of louisiana was heavily impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita katrina was the worst hurricane in us history its destructive power was compounded by the breaks in the levee system around new orleans and the subsequent longterm flooding this flooding set limits on home insurance reimbursements and in some cases rendered void business interruption insurance this will result in changes that will significantly increase the cost of rebuilding hurricanes katrina and rita imposed extensive damage on offshore platforms and pipelines and onshore infrastructure these damages have caused a short term spike in oil and natural gas prices however it is forecasted that the oil prices will drop into the  to  per barrel range and natural gas will stabilize at about  to  per mmbtu these two hurricanes also affected the metropolitan statistical areas msa of new orleans baton rouge lafayette houma lake charles and alexandria it is estimated that over  homes in the new orleans msa were rendered uninhabitable by these two hurricanes and many more were significantly damaged it is also expected that the new orleans msa employment will decline by  from the  levels rebuilding of homes should enable  jobs to be added in  by  new orleans will be the second largest msa in louisiana immediately after katrina the baton rouge msas population rose by about  people as evacuees flooded into the area ultimately this msas population will be limited by its ability to create jobs for the evacuees it is estimated that the baton rouge population will settle in at about  over the prekatrina level which implies the msa will add  jobs in  and another  in  these jobs will come from the relocation of some new orleans firms to baton rouge and from the expansion of baton rouge as a bedroom community for people working in new orleans the influx of new jobs plus the decline in new orleans means that in  the baton rouge msa will be the largest in louisiana it is anticipated that the lafayette msa will add  jobs in  and  jobs in  two factors will boost this msas employment first there will be some relocation of firms from new orleans to this msa secondly fabrication and oilfield service firms will gain business associated with rebuilding the energy infrastructure destroyed in the gulf of mexico it is estimated that the houma msa will have  new jobs in  and  more in  postkatrina this msa will benefit from  the impact of higher energy prices on the extraction sector  the gains for the areas fabricators in rebuilding the damaged energy infrastructure  the boom in port fourchon due to the destruction of other ports servicing the offshore industry and  by becoming a bedroom community for people who work in new orleans it is projected that the lake charles msa will gain  jobs over  this was the hardest hit msa in the state by rita however unlike new orleans lake charles avoided the prolonged flooding problem it is assumed that this region will pick up  new jobs associated with repair from the hurricane these gains will be offset somewhat by the announced closure of lyondell chemical and the temporary loss of jobs due to damage to harrahs two riverboat casinos the alexandria msa is expected to have  new jobs over  three thousand of those jobs are due to the opening of union tank car a megaconstruction project by cleco and the opening of the new federal penitentiary at pollock this msa will gain very marginally from the relocation of firms and families to the region postkatrinarita it is expected that there will be minor job gains in the rural areas of the state especially in tangipahoa parish just northwest across lake ponchartrain from new orleans on the net it is forecasted that nonfarm employment in louisiana will fall by  jobs in  fall a farther  jobs in  and then rebound by  jobs in  as more housing becomes available in new orleans in effect the estimates suggest that katrina and rita wiped out about  years of employment growth in louisiana and decreased the states population in  by  which is a loss significant enough to probably cost the state a congressional seat fund highlights supplemental appropriations are usually passed before the end of the fiscal year based on revisions to estimated revenues by the revenue estimating conference and the needs of various departments and programs these supplemental appropriations are included in the final budget but are not in the original budget final budgeted revenues were approximately  million greater than originally budgeted and final budgeted expenditures were approximately  million greater than originally budgeted transfers in from other funds make up the difference between revenues and expenditures final budgeted expenditures in excess of original budgeted expenditures include  million for higher education mainly due to the disadvantaged or disabled support program  million for department of health and hospitals mainly due to an increase in medical vendor payments made to state of louisiana private providers  million for bond defeasance in accordance with the provisions of article vii section da of the state constitution to produce savings from the early repayment of debt  million for social services mainly due to obligations incurred but unmet in fiscal year  for the temporary assistance for needy family tanf program and expenditures for various other projects or services the final budget for the tanf program was increased to ensure that the obligations would be met in fiscal year  actual revenues were  million less than final budgeted revenues and actual expenditures were  million less than final budgeted expenditures the difference between the final budgeted amounts and actual results can be attributed to an over estimation of final budgeted revenues and expenditures necessary for the operations of the general government and for providing for health and welfare actual revenues and expenditures were lower than budgeted amounts in part because the number of cash assistance cases which provide temporary cash assistance to families in need declined child care expenditures were less than budgeted amounts due to a decrease in the percentage used to calculate payments to subsidize child care centers assets the overall financial position for the state improved from the previous year as reflected in the increase in net assets to  billion  net assets for governmental activities increased by  billion  while net assets for businesstype activities increased by  million  the largest portion of the

development timed in contrast current and other assets eg cash investments receivables and inventory totaled  billion  of total assets at fiscal year end and the state uses some of these resources to repay debt associated with capital assets the current and other assets of the state at june   represent an increase of  from the prior fiscal year cash increased by  million  mainly because of bond sales in the capital outlay  million and timed  million funds a portion of these bond proceeds have been invested contributing to the increase in investments of  million  restricted net assets represent those assets not available for spending as a result of legislative or constitutional requirements donor agreements or grant requirements restricted net assets increased by  billion  from the previous fiscal year for governmental activities due in large part to the increase in investment in capital assets for the timed program restricted net assets increased by  million less than  for

the state the overall performance of the general fund improved by  million in part due to an increase in revenues of  million  for fiscal year  unreservedundesignated fund balance increased to a

payments to healthcare providers for health care services for louisiana residents who are  eligible for the title xix medicaid program  department of corrections inmates or  medically indigent the subgrantee assistance program which provides flowthrough funds for school and community support programs that enhance learning environments and improve the quality of teaching saw an increase of

increases include  million for medical vendor payments and  million for education expenditures for the minimum foundation program which is the mechanism by which all students in public elementary and

bond rating agencies regularly assess the capacity and willingness of the state to repay its general obligation debt moodys investors service standard  poors make their assessments in large part by examining four basic analytical areas economy financial performance and flexibility debt burden administration the economic base is the most critical element in determining the rating growth and diversity in the demographics tax base and employment base of the state over the last decade are indicators of future growth prospects and debt repayment capabilities generally states with higher income levels and diverse economic bases have superior debt repayment capabilities and are better protected from sudden shocks or unexpected volatility in the economy because a strong economy does not always ensure a states ability to meet debt payments the states financial management and performance are also key factors financial analysis involves several factors including accounting and reporting methods revenue and expenditure patterns annual operating and budgetary performance leverage and equity positions budget and financial planning and contingency obligations these factors present a clear indication of the financial strengths and weaknesses of the state the rating agencies analyses of these factors provide the framework for judging maines capacity to manage economic political and financial uncertainties risk management in general the state is selfinsured for health and dental insurance workers compensation tort liability vehicle liability marine and aircraft property losses

were created in  as employment growth was  for the first three quarters of this year almost  jobs have been created with a robust  employment growth stronger than the national average of  wage and salary income increased  in the first half of  also an acceleration from the years before  growth a booming housing market federal spending on defense homeland security and health very strong corporate profitability and a growing tourism trade have helped drive marylands economy construction professional and business services and leisure and hospitality services were the fastest growing industries in maryland in  the construction industry grew by  boosted by continuing low interest rates the nearterm outlook is relatively strong as mortgage rates have only recently started to climb public sector spending has recovered after several weak years and with very strong corporate profits business expansion will continue the professional and business services industry marylands thirdlargest grew by  in  as with the construction sector recent business profitability helps to support the growth of this industry as does the vast amounts of federal spending in maryland on contracts of all descriptions through the first nine months of  this industry has contributed almost onethird of all new jobs in the state despite representing under  of total employment the leisure and hospitality industry also grew by  in  spurred in part by an increase in tourism in the state the number of domestic visitors increased by  to more than  million outpacing national growth of  to date in  this industry has grown  almost twice as fast as the next best industry the manufacturing and information industries were two of the states laggards in  for six of the last eight years manufacturing was the worstperforming industry in the state in the other two years it was secondworst although the industry posted its best performance in four years in  it still declined by  in part due to the longanticipated closure of general motors broening highway plant the information industry has been on a roller coaster ride of late reaching higher highs and lower lows in the last five years than any other industry in maryland at the end of the technology boom in  job growth reached  the best growth of any major industry since  and just two years later the sector cratered as a result of massive overinvestment in telecommunications during the prior several years and the winddown from yk falling by  the secondworst performance of any industry since  the sector is recovering shrinking by only  in  while the prospects for this industry are positive manufacturing seems likely to continue declining current risks to marylands economy include the national economic impact of hurricane katrina rising energy prices and interest rates and the base realignment and closure process shortly after hurricane katrina struck many economists estimated that national economic growth would slow by about one percentage point in the last half of  and increase by about the same amount in the first half of  the majority of the impact would obviously be in louisiana and mississippi but the slowdown was expected to affect most of the country after more consideration the consensus now seems to be that the impact on the national economy will be about half of that previously estimated and with one exception the impact will essentially be concentrated in the states which were directly affected by the storm the one exceptiona significant oneis energy prices while gasoline prices are now below the levels they spiked to for several weeks immediately following katrina in most if not all of the country and oil prices have receded to around  a barrel from a peak of  gasoline and oil prices are still very high relative to not long ago the situation with natural gas is much more dire katrina had a larger effect on gas production than oil production in the gulf inventories of gas are very low as a result a cold winter could result in shortages prices of both natural gas and heating oil will be much higher this winter than last a further sharp rise in energy prices aside from the effect on overall inflation as it flows through the economy could be enough to tip the country into recession and slow marylands growth precipitously if not bring it to a halt rising interest rates could bring a dramatic slowing to the housing market which has been a significant impetus to the states economy the federal reserve has raised interest rates  basis points for twelve consecutive meetings not until recently have the increases in the federal funds rate affected longterm interest rates fixedrate  year mortgages are currently hovering around  roughly where they have stood since the end of  the regulatory steps the fed is taking to restrict the expansion of new types of mortgages which can be risky for many borrowers may perhaps have more of an impact given marylands relative lack of developable land and the stability the federal presence currently lends to the states economy marylands housing market is probably at less risk than most others that have grown similarly over the past several years finally the largest positive risk in the outlook is the base realignment and closure process president bush signed the commissions report on september  congress has  legislative days to disapprove the report or it has the force and effect of law as adjusted by the brac commission maryland will gain a net of about  jobs the bulk of the new jobs will be at ft meade  and aberdeen proving grounds  estimates of the new jobs created indirectly through this process range from  to  longerterm the number of direct indirect and induced jobs could reach as high as  many industries will be affected from central maryland through harford county and the boost to the states economy will be substantial the process wonbe complete for a number of years although the first impacts will begin to be seen in  economic factors and next years budget the states total budget for fiscal year  totals  billion a  percent increase over fiscal year  the budget for fiscal year

education both public and private keeping the economy relatively stable and an incubator for new ideas and growth unemployment has dropped due to this stabilization the commonwealth with an international reputation for medical cultural historical and educational institutions remains the economic and educational hub of new england the commonwealths economy remains diversified but its

liabilities of the commonwealth exceeded its assets at the end of fiscal year  by over  billion of this amount unrestricted net assets is reported as a negative  billion the primary reason for negative unrestricted net assets is that the commonwealth is incurring longterm obligations to either construct or assist political subdivisions in constructing assets owned by these political subdivisions for example upon completion the central artery  third harbor tunnel will be owned by the massachusetts turnpike authority and the massachusetts port authority the commonwealth however is

approved by the electors of the local unit the tax levy of the local unit for debt service purposes is subject to constitutional statutory and charter tax rate limitations in addition several major

from the effect of less capital losses being reported and increased revenues by farmers and small business owners and  increased sales taxes collected because of increased retail sales and the continuing effect of the increased sales tax base expenditures were less than budgeted due to a concerted effort by agency heads to be conservative in spending to compensate for any downturns in

had about  million of the three states  million workers in late  oregons largest metro area is the portlandvancouverbeaverton metropolitan statistical area the portland area is the sixth largest of the seven metro areas with one million or more workers in the three states it includes about half of oregons jobs employment grew more rapidly in oregon than in most neighboring states in the mids due largely to a boom in high technology primarily computer chips transportation equipment such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks and construction the asian financial crisis in  led to weaker manufacturing employment and slower overall job growth in oregon then the national recession hit the state between late  and the middle of  employment fell by as much as  percent much worse than neighboring states since then oregon has seen very rapid job recovery the state surpassed its november  prerecession peak employment level in early  and added about  jobs  during the following eight months during the rapid job growth of the mids oregons unemployment rate ranked in the middle of all states and lower than its neighboring states however the rate rose with the asian financial crisis during the economic boom of the late s and in  oregons unemployment rate did not fall as low as did the rates in neighboring states with the onset of the recession oregons unemployment rate soared from just over  percent in late  to a peak of  percent in the middle of  the states population continued to grow despite the high unemployment rate with weaker but still positive net migration oregon had the nations highest or secondhighest state unemployment rate for  months from april  to october  with the recovery in job growth the unemployment rate eased to about  percent by late  still about one percentage point higher than the national rate oregons major exportrelated industries include lumber and wood products high technology agriculture and food products machinery transportation equipment and tourismrelated sectors the state also has a concentration in call center employment despite the recent rapid job recovery forecasters see no major source of rapid job growth in the near future therefore annual employment growth is expected to slow to less than  percent by  and to only  percent by  still this is higher than the growth forecast for the nation as a whole job growth is expected to be fastest in the professional and business services sector and in the health care industry manufacturing is projected to lose jobs with population projected to grow faster than jobs between  and  oregon may continue to have an elevated unemployment rate during the past ten years the states general governmental expenditures related to education have increased in amount but have decreased as a percentage of total expenditures a tenyear decrease of  percent this relative decline results from a shift in allocation of total expenditures for other program areas such as public safety transportation and debt service expenditures although general governmental expenditures related to human resources have increased as programs to serve needy oregonians have expanded the percentage of total expenditures remains the same as it was ten years ago during this same tenyear period federal revenues while continuing to increase in amount have actually decreased as a percentage of total revenue a tenyear decrease of  percent the reason for this relative decline is the relative increase in general governmental expenditures related to services that are supported more by taxes than by federal revenues eg education human resources public safety thus as taxes have increased to support these services so has the proportion of total revenue generated by taxes the unemployment rate for oregon is currently  percent down from  percent a year ago this is higher than the national rate of  percent employment growth in the second quarter of  was  percent this was the eighth consecutive quarter of job growth an indication of a wellestablished economic recovery in oregons job market budgetary process the oregon budget is approved on a biennial basis by separate appropriation measures a biennium begins july  and ends june  of oddnumbered years measures are passed for the approaching biennium during each regular legislative session held beginning in january of

limitations from other or federal funds dedicated or continuously appropriated funds and may take other actions to meet emergency needs when the legislative assembly is not in session the most significant feature of the budgeting process in oregon is the constitutional requirement that the budget be in balance at the end of each biennium because of this provision oregon may not budget a deficit and is required to alleviate any revenue shortfalls within each biennium revenue and expenditures actual revenue and other financing sources exceeded actual expenditures and other financing uses by  million for the  biennium increasing the ending budgetary fund balance for the biennium actual revenues were greater than budgetary estimates mainly due to higher than expected corporate

economy continues to diversify into the service sector including trade medical and health services education and financial institutions pennsylvanias agricultural industries are also an important component of the commonwealths economic structure particularly in crop and livestock products as well as agribusiness and food related industries greater than projected growth in the national and pennsylvania economies during the second half of  and continuing in early  contributed to improvements in several measures of economic activity including income government finances and jobs in the second half of  economic growth is expected to weaken slightly from the cumulative impacts of recent hurricanes and spikes in oil prices significant increases in energy costs will adversely impact consumer spending and inflation during late  and early  however the national economy is expected to grow at a greater rate during the first part of  as reconstruction activities accelerate and energy prices and demand moderate overall slowtomoderate economic growth is forecasted for the nation and pennsylvania commonwealth financial structure the constitution and the laws of the commonwealth

persons and property  health and human services  public education  recreation and cultural enrichment  economic development  transportation  and transfers to debt service funds  for all obligations except those incurred for highway or other special revenue fund purposes a moderately growing national economy that achieved preliminary estimates for growth resulted in improved economic conditions within significant portions of the national and pennsylvania economies gains in government revenues corporate profits job creation and personal income were experienced however economic growth slowed significantly during the second quarter of  in which real growth in gross domestic product slowed down from  to  on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis an increase in business inventories led to a slowing of business investment and manufacturing during the second quarter of  rising energy prices adversely impacted consumer spending which dropped slightly during the second half of the fiscal year ended june   while personal incomes continued to grow modestly job growth continued during the fiscal year and the unemployment rate continued to drop throughout the fiscal year overall economic conditions positively impacted state revenue growth as revenues exceeded the budget estimate these additional revenues were used in part to replenish portions of reserve funds and to support an increased demand for governmental goods and services particularly in the area of health care costs during the fiscal year ended june   total general fund revenues and other sources exceeded

issuances of  million excluding refundings during the fiscal year ended june   this plan reflects the need to make additional investments in the commonwealths capital infrastructure local capital projects and mass transportation additionally a significant portion of the projected increase in issuances for the  fiscal year is attributable to two major environmental programs which would target capital improvements to water supply and sewage treatment facilities associated with economic development as well as general environmental capital improvement projects debt principal retirements of  million are currently planned for the fiscal year ending june   the commonwealth continues to evaluate refunding opportunities for its outstanding bonds to reduce interest costs during the fiscal year ending june    million of outstanding bonds were refunded to produce over  million of interest savings over the remaining life of those bonds as market conditions provide additional opportunities the commonwealth may pursue additional refundings in addition to general obligation bonds the commonwealth may issue tax anticipation notes to meet operating cash needs during certain months of the fiscal year tax anticipation notes may be issued only for the general fund and the motor license fund they may not exceed  of the funds estimated revenues for the year and must mature during the fiscal year in which they were issued cash shortages may occur during the fiscal year because tax receipts unlike cash disbursements are concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year the commonwealth has not issued tax anticipation notes during the past seven fiscal years and has no plans to issue any during the  fiscal year there were no changes in credit ratings and there were no debt limitations during the fiscal year ended june   that may affect the commonwealths plans during the fiscal year ending june   capital asset activity throughout the fiscal year commonwealth agencies

exports direct investment transfer payments interest rates inflation and tourist expenditures manufacturing is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product manufacturing in puerto rico is now more diversified than during the earlier phases of its industrial development and includes several industries less prone to business cycles in the last three decades industrial development has tended

department of labor and human resources during fiscal year  the labor force was  million compared to  million in fiscal year  unemployment although at relative low historical levels remains above the united states average the average unemployment rate decreased from  during fiscal year  to  in fiscal year  financial information the commonwealth reported a deficit of  billion as of june   a deterioration in the financial position of  billion from last years balances the accumulated deficit is principally the result of the commonwealths practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to its discretely presented component units in order for them to carry out the corresponding construction programs the commonwealths total deficit increased by  billion a  increase as a result of this years operations the governmental activities deficit increased by  billion a  increase while net assets of the businesstype activities showed a decrease of  thousand a  decrease the commonwealths governmental activities had total revenue of  billion which were exceeded by total expenses of  billion excluding transfers received from businesstype activities amounting to  million the commonwealths businesstype activities had total revenue of  billion which exceeded total expenses of  million excluding transfers made to the governmental activities amounting to  million cash management the commonwealth maintains a cash pool for its cash and cash equivalents the balance in the pooled cash accounts is available to meet current operating requirements and any excess is invested in various interestbearing accounts in the government development bank for puerto rico gdb a discretely presented component unit in addition the puerto rico government investment trust fund prgitf was created by the commonwealth pursuant to act no  of august   and began operations on december   prgitf is a noload diversified collective investment trust that was created for the purpose of providing eligible investors with a convenient and economical way to invest in a professionally managed money market portfolio the deposits on hand and the investments purchased are not collateralized secured or guaranteed by the commonwealth or any of its agencies instrumentalities or political subdivisions the commonwealths investment policy is to minimize credit and market risk while maintaining a competitive yield on its portfolio the cash temporarily idle during this year was invested mainly in us government securities stocks corporate bonds repurchase agreements commonwealth securities trading securities and shortterm investments these are primary government investments that are restricted and unrestricted budgetary policy the fiscal year of the commonwealth begins each july  the governor is constitutionally required to submit to the legislature an annual balanced budget of capital improvements and operating expenses of the central government for the ensuing fiscal year the annual budget is prepared by the puerto rico office of management and budget working puerto rico planning board the puerto rico department of the treasury and other government offices and agencies section  of article  of the constitution provides that the appropriations made for any fiscal year shall not exceed the total revenue including available surplus estimated for said fiscal year unless the imposition of taxes sufficient to cover said appropriations is provided by law the commonwealth maintains extensive budgetary controls the objective of these controls is to ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by the legislature activities of the general fund are included in the annual appropriated budget budgetary control resides at the department level the commonwealth also maintains an encumbrance accounting system as one method of maintaining budgetary control the annual budget which is developed using elements of performancebased program budgeting and zerobased budgeting includes an estimate of revenue and other resources for the ensuing fiscal year under laws existing at the time the budget is submitted and legislative measures proposed by the governor and submitted with the proposed budget as well as the governors recommendations as to appropriations that in his judgment are necessary convenient and in conformity with the fouryear investment plan prepared by the puerto rico planning board the legislature may amend the budget submitted by the governor but may not increase items that would cause a deficit without imposing additional taxes to cover such deficit once approved by the legislature the budget is referred to the governor who may decrease or eliminate any item but may not increase or insert new items in the budget the governor may also veto the budget in its entirety and return it to the legislature with his objections the legislature by a twothirds majority in each house may override the governors veto if a budget is not adopted prior to the end of the fiscal year as originally approved by the legislature and the governor it is automatically renewed for the ensuing fiscal year until a new budget is approved by the legislature and the governor this allows the commonwealth to continue to pay operating and other expenses until a new budget is approved assets as noted earlier net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a governments financial position total assets and total liabilities of the commonwealths primary government at june   amounted to  billion and  billion respectively for a net deficit of  billion compared to  billion net deficit at the beginning of the current year as restated a portion of the commonwealths net assets deficit reflects its investment in capital assets such as land buildings equipment and infrastructure less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding the commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide services to its residents consequentially these assets are not available for future spending although the commonwealths investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities an additional portion of the commonwealths net assets deficit represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used an otherwise positive remaining balance would be used to meet the commonwealths ongoing obligations to its residents and creditors internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets at the end of the current fiscal year the commonwealth is able to report positive balances in two categories of net assets and a deficit both for the government as a whole as well as for its separate governmental and businesstype activities as explained earlier the net deficit of the primary government primarily results from the commonwealths practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to the component units so that they can carry out the construction projects the primary government retains the debt while the component units report the corresponding asset financed by such debt total assets increased by  million during the fiscal year  when compared to prior fiscal year restricted cash decreased by  million when compared to the prior year this decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in the unused proceeds from the facilities revenue bonds by the public buildings authority and a reduction in the unused proceeds from the capital fund program bonds as a result of projects carried out during the year net increase in capital assets amounting  billion total liabilities increased  billion during the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year the key elements for this increase are mostly due to the net increase in debt issued of  billion which consisted of issuances during fiscal year  of commonwealth general obligation bonds and notes payable amounting to  million and  billion respectively offset by repayments of such debt in the amount of  million and  billion increases were also experienced in the net pension obligation of  million and the liability for legal claims and judgments of  million the increase in legal claims is the effect of a legal case brought against the commonwealth by parents of special education students as further explained in note  to the basic financial statements the commonwealths net deficit increased by  billion or  from last years total net deficit approximately  of the commonwealths total revenue came from taxes while  resulted from grants and contributions primarily federal financial assistance charges for services represented  of the total revenue the commonwealths expenses cover a range of services the largest expenses were for education public housing and welfare and public safety in  governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenue by  billion resulting in the use of  billion in general revenue mostly taxes and transfers on the other hand program revenue from businesstype activities in  exceeded expenses by approximately  million in addition the businesstype activities had unrestricted investment earnings of  million and transfers to the governmental activities amounting to  million governmental activities decreased the commonwealths net assets by  billion which is on line with the decrease of  billion experienced in the prior year businesstype activities decreased the commonwealths net assets by  million the key factor of this variance was a transfer of funds of  million from the additional lottery system to the general fund as further explained in note  to the basic financial statements debt administration section  of article vi of the constitution of puerto rico provides that direct obligations of the commonwealth evidenced by full faith and credit bonds or notes shall not be issued if the amount of the principal of and interest on such bonds and notes and on all such bonds and notes theretofore issued which is payable in any fiscal year together with any amount paid by the commonwealth in the preceding fiscal year on accounts of bonds or notes guaranteed by the commonwealth exceeds  of the average annual revenue raised under the provisions of the commonwealth legislation and covered into treasury of puerto rico in the two fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year section  of article vi does not limit the amount of debt that the commonwealth may guarantee so long as the  limitation is not exceeded total longterm obligations as of june   were  billion from which  billion are due within one year the longterm obligation of the governmental activities increased by  billion  to  billion when compared to the prior year while the businesstype activities increased by  million  to  million ratings as of september  the commonwealth of puerto rico has a bbb credit rating from standard  poors corporation and a baa from moodys investor service

markets nonfarm jobs are expected to advance  percent in  and  percent in  manufacturing job growth should move back into the black in both years characteristics of tennessee that have been identified as important reasons why firms have chosen sites within the state include work force related factors such as worker productivity righttowork laws and low unionization as well as access to markets and the probusiness attitude of the state other factors include relatively inexpensive energy plentiful natural resources and sunbelt location manufacturing investment in tennessee totaled  billion in

thousand new job opportunities per capita personal income is commonly used to compare economic wellbeing and quality of life across areas tennessee has seen noticeable improvement over time in its per capita income relative to the nation however state per capita income has remained below the us average since  the gap between the us and tennessee narrowed during the strong growth period of the early s then widened from  forward to the onset of the recession in  since then the states relative standing has been improving tennessee job growth slowed in the last half of the decade of the s on the heels of exceptionally strong job growth through  job growth was particularly resilient in  and  coming in at  percent and  percent well ahead of the national pace of job growth job contraction took

the us rate of unemployment stood at  percent in the same year annual average rates fell in  with tennessee coming in at  percent against a us average of  percent longterm financial planning in  legislation was enacted that determined the allocation goal for a reserve for revenue fluctuations to be five percent of the estimated state tax revenues to be allocated to the general fund and education trust fund the revenue fluctuation reserve allows services to be maintained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget beginning with the budget for the fiscal year  and until the statutory funding level is achieved an allocation to the reserve is to be budgeted in an amount at least equal to ten percent of the estimated growth in estimated state tax revenues to be allocated to the general fund and education trust fund amounts in the revenue fluctuation reserve may be utilized to meet state tax revenue shortfalls subject to specific provisions of the general appropriations bill an amount not to exceed the greater of  million or onehalf  of the amount available in the reserve may be used to meet expenditure requirements in excess of budgeted appropriation levels the expansion of the fund is a priority an increase in this reserve that exceeds the minimum legal requirement has been included in the  budget in  tennessee initiated an enterprise resource planning erp automation assessment study to research the feasibility of implementing an erp system to meet the states financial management procurement human resources payroll administration and other administrative business needs currently in the process of procuring software and an integrator the implementation of an erp system is expected to significantly improve the states business processes and thereby its effectiveness and efficiency by enabling the use of best management practices for financial human resource purchasing and other administrative operations relevant financial policies in  the state transformed its medicaid program into a managed care project called tenncare which covered not only medicaid eligible persons but also certain uninsured or uninsurable persons the state is in the process of implementing tenncare reform during fiscal year  these reforms include disenrolling uninsured and uninsurable adults who do not qualify for traditional medicaid categories establishing benefits limits in the pharmacy and medical programs and gaining alterations to federal consent decrees in addition certain operational reforms are underway including returning managed care contractors to risk arrangements upgrading edits in the pharmacy point of sale system and negotiating settlements with centers for medicare and medicaid services on current funding arrangements and prior disallowances these reform strategies are intended to provide the state a greater ability to control tenncare spending the  budget reflects disenrolling uninsured and uninsurable adults and establishing benefit limits in the pharmacy program unreformed a projected  million growth in state funds required in  would consume all of an estimated  million growth in general fund state taxes plus another  million the reform of tenncare allows for needed improvements in other areas such as education with no new taxes and no statewide budget reductions tennessee pursues an aggressive cash management and investment program one aspect of this program that is believed unique to tennessee is the states direct access into the federal reserve wire system through the state trust of tennessee wire services in the federal system are available via a terminal located in the states investment offices this provides the state flexibility in investing and concentrating cash balances pension fund assets and in redeeming warrants and checks issued against the treasury during fiscal year  uncommitted state funds were invested in shortterm collateralized deposits as follows averaged certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us treasuries  and money market accounts  the composite average yield on these investments was  up from  last year tennessee currently provides a subsidy to retiree healthcare premiums based on years of service the funding of those subsidies is on a payasyougo basis new accounting standards will require state and local government employers to account for other postemployment benefits benefits other than pensions by recognizing an obligation in the governmentwide financial statements if the benefits promised to employees are not advance funded as a result of the new accounting standards executive management will soon begin considering whether a change in policy regarding the funding of the states other postemployment benefits is appropriate an actuarial

campaign and legal and lab response training for law enforcement officers prosecutors and firefighters financial information net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a governments financial position in the case of the state of tennessee combined assets exceeded liabilities by  billion as of june   by far the largest portion of the states net assets  reflects its investment in capital assets eg land infrastructure structures and improvements machinery and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding the state uses these capital assets to provide services to its citizens consequently these assets are not available for future spending although the states investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities an additional portion of the states net assets  percent is restricted and represents resources that are subject to either external restrictions or legislative restrictions on how they may be used the remaining balance is unrestricted net assets  billion and may be used to meet the states ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors not funded by resources that are restricted at june   the state was able to report positive balances in all three categories of net assets for the government as a whole and for its separate governmental and businesstype activities the states net assets increased by  billion during the year ended june   most of this increase was attributable to the states decision to adopt the modified approach to infrastructure because of this decision the state capitalized  million in infrastructure expenditures and did not record depreciation expense also tennessee does not fund highway construction by issuing debt but it is funded primarily with fuel taxes and federal grants in the highway fund most of the remaining gain of  million resulted from operations in the education trust sewer treatment loan and employment security funds and other nonmajor enterprise funds tax collections increased for the year and expenditures increased as well the revenue fluctuation reserve has been increased to  million or  of general fund expenditures general fund revenue collections increased for the year by  million sales tax collections increased by  million in addition excise tax collections were up  million due to the improved economy federal revenue collections increased by  million primarily due to increased expenditures in the tenncare program general fund expenditures increased approximately  billion  million of this increase was due to increased expenditures in the tenncare program resulting from pharmacy inflation and medical utilization increases in addition human services experienced increased expenditures of  million this increase was due to the increase in food stamp coupons distributed to citizens of approximately  million the food stamp program has experienced an increase in the number of eligible participants the program is reimbursed  by the federal
