fund to make valuecreating investments in the upstream oil and gas sector bce strategy bayou city targets equity investments ranging from  to  million in the north american ep industry the firm pursues privately negotiated investments through two complementary strategies providing buyout and growth equity capital for small operators with current production and partnering with leading operators to provide dedicated drilling capital in offbalance sheet structures bce management bayou city is led by founding partner william mcmullen formerly of white deer energy and denham capital and partner mark stoner previously vice president of finance at alta mesa holdings lp the partners are supported by chief financial officer kristin eby mackelvey and senior associate andrew koehler commenting on the launch mr mcmullen said our team has quickly worked to highgrade our proprietary pipeline of opportunities and is very much in execution mode the results of these efforts are borne out in bayou citys first acquisition which closed on june   this initial investment is emblematic of the bayou city approach to value creation we have partnered with a seasoned and highly qualified management team in a producing asset that generates meaningful production and cash flow despite prior underexploitation we plan to make targeted investments in the field to improve operational efficiencies replace obsolete equipment with modern oilfield technology recomplete existing wells into new productive zones and drill relatively lowrisk infill development wells mr stoner added small operators have historically been underserved by the institutional capital market oilfield operators work hard to bootstrap a concept into production and reserves but are often disproportionately vulnerable to cash flow disruptions during volatile market cycles like the one we are currently experiencing bayou citys strategy is to help small ep companies fill the funding vacuum and provide the capital and expertise needed to unlock significant value for all stakeholders bce advisory board in addition to its investment professional staff the firms strategic efforts are supplemented by an advisory board composed of industry leaders members of the advisory board include charles cherington cofounder and managing partner of intervale capital gregory beard head of natural resources and senior partner at apollo global management alan clemens technical advisor to quantum energy partners and chairman of rio oil  gas ii llc and thomas perich chairman of andrews kurth llp bce expects to add additional members to its advisory board in the coming monthsbce partners bayou city was formed with an arms length arrangement with intervale capital llc intervale a private equity firm focused exclusively on oilfield services with offices in houston and boston the relationship affords bayou city access to intervales deep network of industry relationships and portfolio of leading oilfield service companies mr cherington said we could not be more delighted to collaborate with the bayou city team intervales portfolio companies include a broad range of service providers and industry participants who can work alongside bayou citys small operators to identify bestinclass environmental safety and operational practices effectively the arrangement brings inhouse a comprehensive suite of operational expertise previously inaccessible or financially impractical  a partnership that in my view is groundbreaking in the smallerend of the energy private
