the underwriters an option to purchase up to additional class a common shares in connection with the offering thereof to cover overallotments we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of any additional class a common shares pursuant to this overallotment option while competition for valueadded cans is based on quality innovation and customer service competition for high volume undifferentiated cans is based primarily on price the relative proximity of service plants to customers is also a competitive factor as transporting formed cans beyond a certain distance generally becomes uneconomical competition is therefore often regional rather than national or international and also varies by can size and specification depending on regional competitors capabilities customer requirements are becoming more demanding which we believe will benefit manufacturing companies with multinational coverage a competitive cost base high quality products outstanding customer service and a broad product portfolio europe our major competitor in the european metal can packaging market is crown holdings inc in addition there are a number of smaller regional producers who often compete within individual enduse categories or in individual regions or countries of europe north america in food and pet food cans silgan holdings inc is our main us competitor and other competitors

on hold decision to postpone new york launch follows digicel dropping of float plan last month tue nov    barry ohalloran paul coulson chairman and edward kilty group chief executive at the ardagh plc annual general meeting in dublin on monday the company has put its us plans on hold because of “challenging” market conditions photograph eric luke         irishowned packaging group ardagh insists it still intends to launch part of its business on the new york stock exchange despite putting those plans on hold because of “challenging” market conditions the paul coulsoncontrolled ardagh recently said its metals division oressa had filed documents with us financial regulator the securities and exchange commission sec indicating that it intended to offer its shares for sale on the new york market the move was expected to earn about € billion for the group however ardagh said on monday that while its preparations were virtually complete conditions for companies launching on the stock exchange in the united states were challenging and as a result it did not believe it would be wise to go to the markets at this time “the group plans to keep the situation under constant review and to remain ready to launch the initial public offering ipo as soon as market conditions are suitable” ardagh’s statement added it is understood it intends to keep updating its sec filings to ensure it its ready to float oressa once it believes market conditions are more suitable ardagh’s move follows last month’s decision by denis o’brien’s telecoms group digicel to drop its plans to float part of the company on the new york market because of recent volatility ardagh decided to pursue a flotation of oressa after talks with a number of potential private equity buyers failed to match expectations mr coulson stressed to industry analysts during a conference call on monday flotation remained “very much” part of ardagh’s plans and the group was prepared to go ahead with its ipo of oressa’s shares when conditions allow when it announced the flotation ardagh said that it intended to use some of the cash raised to pay off part of its € billion debt the group borrowed the money to pay for a buying spree that has quadrupled the size of the business over four years ardagh which has its roots in the old irish glass bottle company bought rivals in europe and the americas growing into a business with € billion revenues a year and  factories in  countries client list its clients include heineken and ab inbev which brews budweiser as well as the likes of food processor john west and beauty products manufacturer l’oréal early in  it completed the € billion purchase of bottle maker verallia north america from french group st gobain however it dropped out of the race to buy the european arm of the same business early this year at the same time it signalled both its plans to float oressa and its intention to cut some of group’s liabilities mr coulson told analysts on monday that reducing debt remained a priority the group has continued to push to add € million to earnings bringing them to € million a year they stood at € million at the end of the third quarter simon west analyst with moody’s investors’ service which assesses companies’ abilities to repay their debts said ardagh’s decision to shelve the oressa flotation was unlikely to alter its credit rating as that was never factored into any money that it might have raised from equity markets “from our perspective it is likely to remain unchanged the fact that the flotation has been delayed it not such a big credit negative” he said       topics denis o brien mr coulson paul coulson simon west securities and exchange commission ardagh digicel oressa verallia north america europe united states  subscribe
