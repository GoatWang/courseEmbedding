performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate

property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances the credit neutral herf score is  the pool has a herf of  compared to  at moodys last review when the herf falls below  moodys uses the excelbased large loan model and then reconciles and weights the results from the conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loanlevel proceeds derived from moodys loanlevel ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure and property type moodys also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations deal performance as of the march   distribution date the transactions

summary of certain risk factors   investors should review the free writing prospectus and the base prospectus including the description of risk factors contained in the free writing prospectus and the base prospectus prior to making a decision to invest in the certificates offered by this term sheet  the free writing prospectus and the base prospectus will include more complete descriptions of the risks described below as well as additional risks relating to among other things risks related to specific mortgage loans and specific property types  any decision to invest in the offered certificates should be made after reviewing the free writing prospectus and the base prospectus conducting such investigations as the investor deems necessary and consulting the investor’s own legal accounting and tax advisors in order to make an independent determination of the suitability and consequences of an investment in the offered certificates  capitalized terms used but not defined in this term sheet shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the free writing prospectus or if not defined therein in the base prospectus   n the volatile economy credit crisis and downturn in the real estate market have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the value of cmbs   — in recent years the real estate and securitization markets including the market for commercial mortgagebacked securities “cmbs” as well as global financial markets and the economy generally have experienced significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility  we cannot assure you that a dislocation in the cmbs market will not reoccur or become more severe   n the offered certificates may not be a suitable investment for you   — the offered certificates are not suitable investments for all investors  in particular you should not purchase any class of offered certificates unless you understand and are able to bear the risk that the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the offered certificates are subject to material variability from period to period and give rise to the potential for significant loss over the life of the offered certificates   — an investment in the offered certificates should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate due diligence on the mortgage loans and the offered certificates   n the offered certificates are limited obligations   — the offered certificates when issued will represent beneficial interests in the issuing entity  the offered certificates will not represent an interest in or obligation of the sponsors the depositor the master servicer the special servicer the operating advisor the certificate administrator the trustee the underwriters or any of their respective affiliates or any other person   — the primary assets of the issuing entity will be the notes evidencing the mortgage loans and the primary security and source of payment for the mortgage loans will be the mortgaged properties and the other collateral described in the free writing prospectus  payments on the offered certificates are expected to be derived from payments made by the borrowers on the mortgage loans   n mortgage loans are nonrecourse and are not insured or guaranteed   — the mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by any person or entity governmental or otherwise   — investors should treat each mortgage loan as a nonrecourse loan  if a default occurs recourse generally may be had only against the specific properties and other assets that have been pledged to secure the loan  consequently payment prior to maturity is dependent primarily on the sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property  payment at maturity is primarily dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to refinance the mortgaged property   n the certificates may have limited liquidity and the market value of the certificates may decline   — your certificates will not be listed on any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association and there is currently no secondary market for your certificates  while we have been advised by the underwriters that one or more of them or one or more of their affiliates currently intend to make a market in the offered certificates none of the underwriters has any obligation to do so any marketmaking may be discontinued at any time and we cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the offered certificates will develop   — the market value of the offered certificates will also be influenced by the supply of and demand for cmbs generally the supply of cmbs will depend on among other things the amount of commercial and multifamily mortgage loans whether newly originated or held in the portfolios that are available for securitization   n legal and regulatory provisions affecting investors could adversely affect the liquidity of the offered certificates   — except as regards their status under the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended we make no representation as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment financial institution regulatory financial reporting or other purposes as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the offered certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions  we note that regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire cmbs which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the offered certificates who are not subject to those provisions to resell their certificates in the secondary market   the securities offered by these materials are being offered when as and if issued in particular you are advised that the offered securities and the asset pool backing them are subject to modification or revision including among other things the possibility that one or more classes of securities may be split combined or

tollfree  or by email to prospectusnygscom        summary of certain risk factors continued   — member states of the european economic area “eea” are in the process of implementing new article a of the banking consolidation directive directive ec as amended “article a” which applies to new securitizations issued on or after december   and in certain circumstances to securitizations issued prior to that date among other provisions article a restricts investments by an eea regulated credit institution and in some cases consolidated group entities in securitizations that fail to comply with certain requirements concerning retention by the originator sponsor or original lender of the securitized assets of a portion of the securitization’s credit risk  additionally article a imposes a severe capital charge on a securitization’s securities acquired by an eea regulated credit institution if that securitization fails to meet the requirements of article a  none of the originators the sponsors the depositor or the issuing entity have taken or intend to take any steps to comply with the requirements of article a  the fact that the offered certificates have not been structured to comply with article a is likely to limit the ability of an eearegulated credit institution to purchase offered certificates which in turn may adversely affect the liquidity of the offered certificates in the secondary market  this could adversely affect your ability to transfer offered certificates or the price you may receive upon your sale of offered certificates   — the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in the united states requires that federal banking regulators amend their regulations such that capital charges imposed on banking institutions are determined to a lesser extent on the ratings of their investments  when such regulations are adopted investments in cmbs by such institutions may result in greater capital charges to financial institutions that own cmbs or otherwise adversely affect the treatment of cmbs for regulatory capital purposes   — the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products  these changes or any future changes may affect the accounting for entities such as the issuing entity could under certain circumstances require an investor or its owner generally to consolidate the assets of the issuing entity in its financial statements and record third parties’ investments in the trust fund as liabilities of that investor or owner or could otherwise adversely affect the manner in which the investor or its owner must report an investment in cmbs for financial reporting purposes   — for purposes of the secondary mortgage market enhancement act of  as amended no class of offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities”   n commercial multifamily and manufactured housing community lending is dependent upon net operating income   — the repayment of the mortgage loans in the pool will be dependent upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents  however net operating income can be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on a mortgage loan at any given time  the performance andor value of a particular incomeproducing real property will depend on a number of variables including but not limited to property type geographic location competition and sponsorship   n risks resulting from various concentrations   — the performance of the pool of mortgage loans may be adversely impacted as a result of i mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s aggregate principal balance ii a concentration of mortgage loans secured by the same mortgaged property types iii a concentration of mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties located in a particular geographic area iv a concentration of mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties with the same tenants and v a concentration of mortgage loans with the same borrower or related borrowers  the effect of loan pool losses will be more severe if the losses relate to mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s aggregate principal balance  likewise mortgaged properties in which a single tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if that tenant’s business operations are negatively impacted or if such tenant fails to renew its lease   — a concentration of related borrowers mortgaged property types tenant occupancy or mortgaged properties in similar geographic regions can pose increased risks because a decline in the financial condition of the corporate family of the related borrowers in a particular industry or business or in a particular geographic area would have a disproportionately large impact on the pool of mortgage loans   n borrower may be unable to repay remaining principal balance on maturity date or anticipated repayment date   — mortgage loans with substantial remaining principal balances at their stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date involve greater risk than fullyamortizing mortgage loans  this is because the borrower may be unable to repay the loan at that time  a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date as applicable typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment   n the timing of prepayments and repurchases may change your anticipated yield   — we are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experiences of commercial mortgage loans including both voluntary prepayments if permitted and involuntary prepayments such as prepayments resulting from casualty or condemnation defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or purchases by a companion loan holder or mezzanine lender pursuant to a purchase option or sales of defaulted mortgage loans   — any changes in the weighted average lives of your certificates may adversely affect your yield   — each sponsor is the sole warranting party in respect of the mortgage loans sold by such sponsor to the depositor and the sole party with repurchasesubstitution obligations in connection with a material breach of representation and warranty or a material document deficiency we cannot provide assurances that the applicable sponsor will have the financial ability to repurchase or substitute any mortgage loan sold by it in connection with either a material breach of the applicable sponsor’s representations and warranties or any material document defects   the securities offered by these

this offering will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling tollfree  or by email to prospectusnygscom        summary of certain risk factors continued   n litigation regarding the mortgaged properties or borrowers may impair your distributions   — there may be pending or threatened legal proceedings against the borrowers and the managers of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates arising out of their ordinary business  any such litigation may materially impair distributions to certificateholders if borrowers must use property income to pay judgments or litigation costs  we cannot assure you that any litigation or any settlement of any litigation will not have a material adverse effect on your investment   n appraisals may not reflect current or future market value of each property   — appraisals were obtained with respect to each of the mortgaged properties at or about the time of origination of the applicable mortgage loan  by the related originator or at or around the time of the acquisition of the mortgage loan by the related sponsor  in general appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present or future value   — prospective investors should consider that the information set forth in this term sheet regarding appraised values or loantovalue ratios may not accurately reflect past present or future market values of the mortgaged properties  additionally with respect to the appraisals setting forth assumptions as to the as stabilized values prospective investors should consider that those assumptions may not be accurate and that the as stabilized values may not be the values of the related mortgaged properties at maturity   n adverse environmental conditions at or near mortgaged properties may result in losses   — the issuing entity could become liable for a material adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property any such potential liability could reduce or delay payments on the offered certificates   — although an environmental report was prepared for each mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan in connection with origination it is possible that the environmental reports andor supplemental “phase ii” sampling did not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware  also the environmental condition of the mortgaged properties in the future could be affected by the activities of tenants or by third parties unrelated to the borrowers   n availability of earthquake flood and other insurance   — although the mortgaged properties are required to be insured or selfinsured by a sole tenant against certain risks there is a possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which may result from risks not covered by insurance   — even if terrorism insurance is required by the loan documents for a mortgage loan that requirement may be subject to a cap on the cost of the premium for terrorism insurance that a borrower is required to pay or a commercially reasonable standard on the availability of the insurance   — we cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts   n risks relating to a bankruptcy of an originator a sponsor or the depositor or a receivership or conservatorship of goldman sachs bank usa   — in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of an originator a sponsor or the depositor or a receivership or conservatorship of goldman sachs bank usa “gs bank” it is possible that the issuing entity’s right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans could be challenged if such challenge is successful payments on the offered certificates would be reduced or delayed even if the challenge is not successful payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim   — the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic has adopted a rule substantially revised and effective january   establishing a safe harbor the fdic safe harbor from its repudiation powers for securitizations meeting the requirements of the rule  cfr §   the transfers of the applicable mortgage loans by goldman sachs lending partners llc “gslp” as an originator to goldman sachs mortgage company “gsmc” as a sponsor and by gsmc to the depositor will not qualify for the fdic safe harbor  however those transfers are not transfers by a bank and in any event even if the fdic safe harbor were applicable to those transfers the fdic safe harbor is nonexclusive additionally an opinion of counsel will be rendered on the closing date to the effect that the transfers of the applicable mortgage loans by gslp to gsmc and by gsmc to the depositor would each generally be respected as a sale in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of gslp or gsmc as applicable and therefore beyond the fdic’s repudiation powers if gs bank became subject to a receivership or conservatorship notwithstanding the foregoing the fdic a creditor bankruptcy trustee or another interested party including an entity transferring a mortgage loan as debtorinpossession could still attempt to assert that the transfer of a mortgage loan was not a sale if such party’s challenge is successful payments on the offered certificates would be reduced or delayed  even if the challenge is not successful payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while a court

tollfree  or by email to prospectusnygscom        summary of certain risk factors continued   n potential conflicts of interest in the selection of the underlying mortgage loans   — the anticipated initial investor in certain of the subordinate certificates the “bpiece buyer” was given the opportunity by the sponsors to perform due diligence on the mortgage loans originally identified by the sponsors for inclusion in the issuing entity and to request the removal resizing or change in the expected repayment dates or other features of some or all of the mortgage loans  the mortgage pool as originally proposed by the sponsors was adjusted based on some of these requests actions of the bpiece buyer may be adverse to those of purchasers of classes of offered certificates   n interests and incentives of the originators the sponsors and their affiliates may not be aligned with your interests   — the originators the sponsors and their affiliates including certain of the underwriters expect to derive ancillary benefits from this offering of offered certificates and their respective incentives may not be aligned with those of purchasers of the offered certificates  the sponsors originated or purchased the mortgage loans in order to securitize the mortgage loans by means of a transaction such as the offering of the offered certificates  the sponsors will sell the applicable mortgage loans to the depositor an affiliate of gsmc one of the sponsors and goldman sachs  co one of the underwriters on the closing date in exchange for cash derived from the sale of certificates to investors andor in exchange for certificates  a completed offering would reduce the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans  the originators made the mortgage loans with a view toward securitizing them and distributing the exposure by means of a transaction such as this offering of offered certificates  the offering of offered certificates will effectively transfer the originators’ exposure to the mortgage loans to purchasers of the offered certificates   — the originators are the mezzanine lenders under their respective mezzanine loans  on the closing date gslp will be the lender on the companion loan  the originators may retain the mezzanine loans or the companion loan as applicable these transactions may cause the originators and their affiliates or their clients or counterparties who purchase the mezzanine loans or the companion loan as applicable to have economic interests and incentives that do not align with and that may be directly contrary to those of an investor in the certificates  in addition these transactions or actions taken to maintain adjust or unwind any positions in the future may individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on the market for the certificates if any including adversely affecting the value of the certificates particularly in illiquid markets  the originators the sponsors and their affiliates will have no obligation to take refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to the mezzanine loans or the companion loan as applicable based on the potential effect on an investor in the offered certificates and may receive substantial returns from these transactions   — the originators the sponsors and their affiliates expect to receive various benefits including compensation commissions payments rebates remuneration and business opportunities in connection with or as a result of this offering of offered certificates and their interests in the mortgage loans   — each of the foregoing relationships should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered certificates   n interests and incentives of the underwriter entities may not be aligned with your interests   — the activities and interests of the underwriters and their respective affiliates collectively the “underwriter entities” will not align with and may in fact be directly contrary to those of the certificateholders  the underwriter entities are part of global investment banking securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations financial institutions governments and highnetworth individuals as such they actively make markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers   — the underwriter entities’ activities include among other things executing large block trades and taking long and short positions directly and indirectly through derivative instruments or otherwise  the securities and instruments in which the underwriter entities take positions or expect to take positions include loans similar to the mortgage loans securities and instruments similar to the offered certificates and other securities and instruments  market making is an activity where the underwriter entities buy and sell on behalf of customers or for their own account to satisfy the expected demand of customers  by its nature market making involves facilitating transactions among market participants that have differing views of securities and instruments  as a result you should expect that the underwriter entities will take positions that are inconsistent with or adverse to the investment objectives of investors in the offered certificates   — if the underwriter entities becomes a holder of any of the certificates through marketmaking activity or otherwise any actions that they take in their capacity as a certificateholder including voting providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other holders of the same class or other classes of the certificates   — in addition the underwriter entities will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the certificates or the actions of the master servicer the special servicer the trustee the certificate administrator or the operating advisor and will have no authority to advise the master servicer the special servicer the trustee the certificate administrator or the operating advisor or to direct their actions   — each of the
