capital appreciation when consistent with current income is a secondary investment objective under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in inflationlinked securities and at least  of its total managed assets in us tips the fund may also invest up to  of its total managed assets in nonus dollar investments which gives the fund flexibility to invest up to  of its total managed assets in nonus dollar inflationlinked securities no more than  of its nonus dollar exposure may be unhedged in addition the fund may also invest up to  of its total managed assets in currency strategies using instruments such as currency forwards futures and options to take long and short currency positions the fund may invest up to  of its total managed assets in below investment grade securities or if unrated assets of comparable quality as determined by management the fund may invest up to  of its total managed assets in commodityrelated strategies the fund currently expects that the average effective duration of its portfolio will range between zero and  years although this target duration may change from time to time there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives hedging strategy the fund uses various investment strategies designed to help limit risk and to preserve capital though the fund is not required to be hedged at all times the hedging strategies include among others the use of swaps futures contracts short sales options on futures or options based on us treasury securities an index of longerterm securities or other instruments we are particularly focused on hedging highvolatility market events such as employment release dates the hedging strategies employed seek to achieve a relatively stable net asset value there can be no guarantee that the funds’ hedging strategies will be employed under all market conditions or will be successful additionally the cost paid for the hedging strategies may result in a reduction of the net asset value of a fund and as a result could make the fund worse off than if such hedging strategies had not been used for periodic shareholder reports and recent fundspecific filings please visit the us securities and exchange commission “sec” website via the following httpwwwsecgovcgibinbrowseedgaractiongetcompanycik frequently asked questions how much experience does the manager have with managing us tips managing us tips in institutional clients portfolios has been an area of expertise of western since us tips were issued back in  what are the mechanics of tips and how is the income affected by inflation cpiu us tips are issued by the us treasury department and pay a fixed coupon on a principal value that adjusts for inflation as measured by the cpiu historically inflation has exhibited a certain seasonality which may be attributed to varying economic and business cycles inflation has generally trended up at the beginning of the year down in the summer up slightly in the fall and down dramatically in november and december one of the mechanics of us tips is the principal value’s adjustment for inflation which occurs after a brief lag from the bureau of labor statistics’ announcement date in other words the cpiu announced in december which actually refers to november’s inflation impacts the accretion on us tips for january the cpiu announced in january in reference to december’s inflation impacts the accretion for us tips in february accretion is essentially the adjustment of principal value due to changes in the cpiu since the income from us tips is based on both a fixed coupon and a variable component based on principal value that adjusts for inflation this seasonality may cause us tips’ income to fluctuate one of the fund’s goals is to “smooth out” the seasonality of its income by seeking to provide a relatively stable monthly dividend to shareholders based upon the outlook for the year in years where inflation follows its historical trend the fund would generate significantly less income during january and february than the remaining months of the year as a result it is likely that in some months like january and february the dividend in a given month may exceed the fund’s income that month if such a deficit occurs it is because the fund expects to make up the deficit in months where the fund’s income exceeds the dividend although there is no assurance this will happen should the fund’s net income be insufficient to meet the distributions to shareholders in a given month the fund will send a notice to shareholders indicating the source of these distributions for each calendar year the final characterization of the fund’s distributions will be reported to shareholders on form div the following january describe the differences between closedend and openend funds an openend fund may be purchased or sold at nav an openend fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares when selling an openend fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the nav is calculated unlike the openend fund a closedend fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand an investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open the common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the nav does the protective hedge guarantee safety there are no guarantees in hedging the fund uses various investment strategies designed to help limit risk and to preserve capital though the fund is not required to be hedged at all times the hedging strategies include among others the use of swaps futures contracts short sales options on futures or options based on us treasury securities an index of longerterm securities or other instruments we are particularly focused on hedging highvolatility market events such as employment release dates the hedging strategies employed seek to achieve a relatively stable net asset value there can be no guarantee that the fund’s hedging strategies will be employed under all market conditions or will be successful additionally the cost paid for the hedging strategies may result in a reduction of the net asset value of a fund and as a result could make the fund worse off than if such hedging strategies had not been used when does the protective hedge come into effect the protective hedge is generally created by purchasing outofthemoney put options on treasury securities as interest rates rise the options increase in value helping to offset any declines in the valuation of the us tips and corporate securities what does the exdiv or the exdividend date refer to every month the fund pays dividends and those investors who purchase the fund before the exdividend date will receive the next dividend distribution investors who purchase on or after the exdividend date will not receive the next dividend distribution the value of the dividend is subtracted from the funds nav on the exdividend date each month so when the nav is reported with an exdiv behind it this means that the amount of the dividend has already been taken out of the nav what is the drip and how does it work drip is the dividend reinvestment plan the number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the plan in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner whenever the market price per share of the fund’s common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share on the valuation date participants in the plan will be issued new shares valued at the higher of net asset value or  of the thencurrent market value otherwise the administrator will buy shares of the common stock in the open market on the nyse or elsewhere fund managers the fund will be managed by western asset founded in  one of the

assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives the value of the fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities historically closedend funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value risk is inherent in all investing including the loss of your entire principal therefore before investing you should consider the following risks carefully market discount risk shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value and the fund’s shares may trade at a price that is less than the initial offering price net asset value will be reduced immediately following the initial offering by a  sales load charge and offering costs paid by the fund the risk of investing in a newly organized closedend investment company may be greater for investors who sell their shares in a relatively short period of time after completion of the initial offering the common shares are designed for longterm investors and should not be treated as trading vehicles interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the bonds in the fund’s portfolio including inflationlinked securities and us tips will decline in value because of increases in market interest rates the prices of longerterm bonds generally fluctuate more than prices of shorterterm bonds as interest rates change because the fund will invest primarily in intermediate to longerterm bonds the common share net asset value and market price per share will fluctuate more in response to changes in market interest rates than if the fund invested primarily in shorterterm bonds because market interest rates are currently near their lowest levels in many years there is a greater risk that the fund’s portfolio will decline in value the fund’s use of leverage as described below will increase interest rate risk see risks—leverage risk risks relating to us tips the value of inflationprotected securities such as us tips generally fluctuates in response to changes in real interest rates which are in turn tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation therefore if inflation were to rise at a faster rate than nominal interest rates real interest rates might decline leading to an increase in value of us tips in contrast if nominal interest rates increased at a faster rate than inflation real interest rates might rise leading to a decrease in value of us tips although the principal value of us tips declines in periods of deflation holders at maturity receive no less than the par value of the bond however if the fund purchases us tips in the secondary market whose principal values have been adjusted upward due to inflation since issuance the fund may experience a loss if there is a subsequent period of deflation if inflation is lower than expected during the period the fund holds us tips the fund may earn less on the securities than on conventional bonds any increase in principal value of us tips caused by an increase in the index is taxable in the year the increase occurs even though the fund will not receive cash representing the increase at that time as a result the fund could be required at times to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its distribution requirements as a regulated investment company under the code if real interest rates rise ie if interest rates rise due to reasons other than inflation the value of the us tips in the fund’s portfolio will decline in addition because the principal amount of us tips would be adjusted downward during a period of deflation the fund will be subject to deflation risk with respect to its investments in these securities the daily adjustment of the principal value of us tips is currently tied to the nonseasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers which is calculated monthly by the us bureau of labor statistics the consumer price index for all urban consumers is a measurement of changes in the cost of living made up of components such as housing food transportation and energy there can no assurance that such index will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services the us treasury only began issuing inflationprotected securities in  and the market for such securities may be less developed or liquid and more volatile than certain other securities markets as a result the us treasury currently issues us tips in only tenyear maturities although us tips with different maturities have been issued in the past and may be issued in the future risks relating to inflationlinked securities the fund invest in inflationprotected securities with other structures or characteristics as such securities become available in the market it is currently expected that other types of inflationprotected securities would have characteristics similar to those described above in risks relating to us tips credit risk credit risk is the risk that one or more bonds in the fund’s portfolio will decline in price or fail to pay interest or principal when due because the issuer of the bond experiences a decline in its financial status the fund may invest in bonds that are not at the time of investment investment grade quality investment grade bonds are bonds rated within a rating agency’s four highest grades baabbb or higher by moody’s sp or fitch or a similar rating of another nationally recognized rating agency or bonds that are unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by western asset the prices of these lower grade bonds are more sensitive to negative developments such as a decline in the issuer’s revenues or a general economic downturn than are the prices of higher grade securities bonds of below investment grade quality commonly referred to as ‘‘junk bonds’’ are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due and therefore involve a greater risk of default bonds in the lowest investment grade category may also be considered to possess some speculative characteristics by certain rating agencies lower grade bonds tend to be less liquid than investment grade bonds and investments in lower grade bonds will expose the fund to greater risks than if the fund owned only higher grade securities lower grade and unrated securities risk the fund may invest in bonds that are not at the time of investment investment grade quality lower grade securities or equivalent unrated securities typically entail greater potential price volatility and may be less liquid than higherrated securities lower grade securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal these securities may also be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry conditions than higherrated securities unrated securities may be less liquid than comparable rated securities and involve the risk that western asset may not accurately evaluate the security’s comparative credit rating analysis of the creditworthiness of issuers of lower grade securities may be more complex than for issuers of higherquality debt obligations to the extent that the fund holds lower grade andor unrated securities the fund’s success in achieving its investment objectives may depend more heavily on western asset’s credit analysis than if the fund held exclusively higherquality and rated securities leverage risk the use of leverage—through the issuance of preferred shares and borrowing of money and under certain circumstances reverse repurchase agreements short sales futures contracts credit default swaps dollar roll transactions and other investment techniques—to purchase additional investments creates an opportunity for increased common share net investment income dividends and capital appreciation but also creates special risks for common shareholders the fund’s leveraging strategy may not be successful leverage is a speculative technique that may expose the fund to greater risk and increased costs increases and decreases in the value of the fund’s portfolio will be magnified when the fund uses leverage as a result leverage will cause greater changes in the fund’s net asset value the fund will also have to pay dividends with respect to preferred shares andor interest with respect to other forms of leverage which may reduce the fund’s return this expense may be greater than the fund’s return on the underlying investments it is anticipated that dividends with respect to preferred shares andor interest with respect to other forms of leverage will be based on shorterterm interest rates that would be periodically reset the fund intends to invest the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares or the use of other forms of leverage principally in intermediate and longerterm bonds so long as the fund’s portfolio provides a higher rate of return net of fund expenses than dividend rates on preferred shares and interest rates on other forms of leverage as reset periodically the use of leverage will allow common shareholders to receive a higher current return than if the fund were not leveraged if however shorterterm interest rates rise relative to intermediate and longterm interest rates or the rate of return on the fund’s portfolio dividend rates on preferred shares and interest rates on other forms of leverage could exceed the rate of return on intermediate and longerterm bonds and other investments held by the fund reducing the return to common shareholders there can be no assurance that the use of leverage will result in a higher yield on the common shares when leverage is employed the net asset value and market price of the common shares and the yield to common shareholders will be more volatile the use of leverage will cause the fund’s net asset value to fall more sharply in response to increases in interest rates than it would in the absence of the use of leverage in addition preferred shares if issued are expected to pay cumulative dividends which may tend to increase leverage risk leverage creates two major types of risks for common shareholders the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of the common shares because changes in the value of the fund’s assets including investments bought with the proceeds from the use of leverage are borne entirely by the common shareholders and the possibility either that common share net investment income will fall if the interest and dividend rates on leverage rise or that common share net investment income will fluctuate because the interest and dividend rates on leverage vary in addition under certain circumstances common shareholders may not receive dividends but holders of preferred shares may because preferred shares have priority of payment over common shares the issuance of preferred shares will also alter the voting power of common shareholders if the fund has preferred shares outstanding two of the fund’s trustees will be elected by the holders of preferred shares voting separately as a class the remaining trustees of the fund will be elected by holders of common shares and preferred shares voting together as a single class in the unlikely event that the fund fails to pay dividends on preferred shares for two years holders of the preferred shares would be entitled to elect a majority of the trustees of the fund issuer risk the value of a corporate debt instrument may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods and services smaller company risk the general risks associated with corporate debt obligations are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with smaller market capitalizations these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources or may depend on a few key employees as a result they may be subject to greater levels of credit interest rate and issuer risk securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in less volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities companies with mediumsized market capitalizations may have risks similar to those of smaller companies country risk investments in securities of nonus issuers including those denominated in us dollars involve certain risks not typically associated with investments in domestic issuers for example the value of those investments may decline in response to unfavorable political and legal developments unreliable or untimely information or economic and financial instability settlement procedures outside the us may also involve additional risks emerging markets risk investment in securities of issuers based in developing or ‘‘emerging market’’ countries entails all of the risks of investing in securities of nonus issuers as described above but to a heightened degree among others these types of investments can include not only ‘‘brady bonds’’ bonds issued as a result of a debt restructuring plan but also eurobonds domestic and international bonds issued under the laws of a developing country emerging market loans and other debt instruments emerging market countries typically have economic and political systems that are less fully developed and can be expected to be less stable than those of more developed countries for example the economies of such countries can be subject to rapid and unpredictable rates of inflation or deflation low trading volumes may result in a lack of liquidity and in price volatility emerging market countries may have policies that restrict investment by foreigners or that prevent foreign investors from withdrawing their money at will because the fund may invest in securities or instruments of emerging market issuers investors should be able to tolerate sudden and sometimes substantial fluctuations in the value of their investments in the fund mortgagerelated securities risk the fund may invest in a variety of mortgagerelated securities including commercial mortgage securities stripped mortgagebacked securities including interestonly ‘‘io’’ and principalonly ‘‘po’’ securities and other mortgagebacked instruments rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgagerelated securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates in addition mortgagerelated securities are subject to prepayment risk as discussed below also a rapid rate of principal prepayments may have a measurably adverse effect on the fund’s yield to maturity to the extent it invests in ios if the assets underlying the ios experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the fund may fail to recoup fully its initial investment in these securities conversely pos tend to increase in value if prepayments are greater than anticipated and decline if prepayments are slower than anticipated the fund’s investments in assetbacked securities are subject to risks similar to those associated with mortgagerelated securities prepayment risk many fixed income securities especially those issued at high interest rates provide that the issuer may repay them early issuers often exercise this right when interest rates decline accordingly holders of securities that may be called or prepaid may not benefit fully from the increase in value that other fixed income securities experience when rates decline furthermore the fund reinvests the proceeds of the payoff at current yields which are lower than those paid by the security that was paid off reinvestment risk reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund’s portfolio will decline if and when the fund reinvests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the portfolio’s current earnings rate a decline in income could affect the common shares’ market price or their overall returns derivatives risk the fund may invest in a variety of derivative instruments for investment or risk management purposes such as options futures contracts and swaps derivatives are subject to a number of risks described elsewhere in this prospectus such as interest rate risk leverage risk and management risk the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivatives contracts purchased by the fund if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivatives contract the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances derivative transactions also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation the risk of ambiguous documentation and the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with an underlying asset interest rate or index suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the fund will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial or that these transactions will be successful inflationdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the fund’s assets or income from the fund’s investments may be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the real value of the fund’s portfolio could decline inflation risk is expected to be greater with respect to the fund’s investments in securities or instruments other than us tips deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy may decline over time—the opposite of inflation deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the fund’s portfolio because the principal amounts of us tips would be adjusted downward during a period of deflation the fund will be subject to deflation risk with respect to its investments in such securities turnover risk the length of time the fund has held a particular security is not generally a consideration in investment decisions a change in the securities held by the fund is known as ‘‘portfolio turnover’’ as a result of the fund’s investment policies under certain market conditions the fund’s turnover rate may be higher than that of other investment companies portfolio turnover generally involves some expense to the fund including brokerage commissions or dealer markups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestment in other securities these transactions may result in realization of taxable capital gains higher portfolio turnover rates such as those above  are likely to result in higher brokerage commissions or other transaction costs and could give rise to a greater amount of taxable capital gains management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio western asset will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results market disruption and geopolitical risks the war with iraq its aftermath and the continuing occupation of the country by coalition forces are likely to have a substantial impact on
