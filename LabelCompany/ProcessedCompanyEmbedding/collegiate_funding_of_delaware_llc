centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of 0 or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of 0 however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and 0 profit the extra taxes on the 0 would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do

division of corporations to form the delaware llc on public record your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you other states refer to this document as articles of organization but delaware does not use that terma certificate of formation must includethe name of the llcthe name and address of the registered agentthe signature of an authorized individualof special note if the delaware llc is a series llc which protects assets of parts of the llc from the liabilities of other parts of the llc then this must be indicated on the certificate of formation

members andor managers on the certificate of formationdelaware llc operating agreementwith our complete package we draft an operating agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures delaware requires that llcs have an operating agreement that will govern it however delaware does not require that the operating agreement be filed with the state or even be in writingit is recommended that you have a written signed agreement even in a singlemember delaware llc the operating agreement is important because it provides a decisionmaking structure that will benefit the llc when dealing with other entities increase protection and increase credibility for financial transactions the operating agreement will include provisions such as liability ownership dissolution and transfer of interest among othersmany incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems a wellcrafted delaware operating agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different directionsigning the llc operating agreementonce the delaware operating agreement has been drafted and approved all members should execute it most delaware llcs as a practical matter will not draft and finalize the operating agreement until after formation many formal requirements of corporations such as those related to voting and annual meetings are not required by llcs  to this extent many wellcrafted operating agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operationswhile an operating agreement can be enforceable unsigned it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned operating agreement was agreed upon by all members in multimember llcs it is especially important to have a signed operating agreement should you change the agreement or ownership structure an amended and restated llc operating agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes top 0 reasons to form an llc in delaware delaware llcs offer the most protection for you and your business with twoway protectionby forming a delaware llc you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities this means that if the business itself cannot pay a creditor then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets such as your house car and other personal possessionsdelaware explicitly makes the “charging order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of llc members this prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the llc’s distributions to that member not a control interest or a right to liquidate the llc delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any statedelaware governs the internal affairs of your company including its liability shield the corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the delaware llc act which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business is thicker than any protection offered in any other state delaware llcs can operate in almost any state or countryyou can form a delaware llc no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the united states outside the united states there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a delaware llc and a delaware llc does not need to have a bank account or office in delaware a registered agent such as incnow maintains a physical address in delaware required to forward court and delaware government notices to you delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businesswhen entering into a delaware llc it is flexible in ownership and management structure one individual can serve as both the owner and manager an llc is governed by its operating agreement allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written since the llc is a contractual entity it is important that the delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written furthermore there is no required annual general meeting and there is much less administrative paperwork in general compared to a corporation managers are protected from lawsuitsthe llc agreement in delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties this allows business managers and controlling managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors provided such actions are not in bad faith even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced business managers have the freedom to make business decisions even if losses result without manager liability provided the decisions are not selfdealing even selfdealing is not entirely prohibited instead selfdealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members no delaware income tax if your operations are in other states and other business tax loopholesthere is no delaware tax return to file for llcs that are formed in delaware provided they conduct no business in delawareas with llcs in other states profits are taxed personally at the member level but not at the llc level an llc is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership unless it elects scorporation or ccorporation tax statushaving an llc that elects to be taxed as an scorporation can save thousands in selfemployment taxes because your income can be split  between selfemployment income and “sdividend” income the sdividend can reduce your taxes by thousands for example splitting  of income would save the selecting llc member more than  in social security and medicare taxes learn more about these advantages in our llc tax tips section delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsthe delaware secretary of state’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour you can use

for the resolution of business disputes the court of chancery its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not there are no jury trials in the court of chancery so court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the courtthe delaware court system can act very quickly sometimes the whole process from start to finish discovery and motions to trial decisions can be over in two months written decisions from the court of chancery are the standard and are often  pages long this wellreasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes even appeals to the delaware supreme court can be expedited the delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials0 delaware has the most probusiness laws of any us statedelaware’s law is generally thought to be probusiness and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses because of the maturity of delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by delaware’s judicial system there is predictability in outcomesthis means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your llc there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate even when judges change it is not a favoritism or political system judges in delaware make reasoned nonpolitical decisions more about llcswhat is a delaware

 st year free registered agent start my llc start your delaware llc in  simple steps the state of delaware is home to half of all public and fortune 0 companies but that doesn’t mean that small businesses miss out on all its big benefits as the most popular business entity the llc offers delawarebased owners many tax advantages and asset protections in a state heralded for its strong case law first however it’s vital to know the legal side of getting your business off the ground here’s how to form an llc in the diamond state step one choosing your llc’s name the first step in starting a new llc in delaware is to choose a name your new delaware llc’s name must be sufficiently different for people to tell it apart from other business entities already on file registered and reserved with the state of delaware is the name you want available you can do a name search at the delaware division of corporations the llc’s name must include at its end “limited liability company” “llc” or “llc” the llc name is allowed however to contain the name of a member or manager as well as one of the following terms “company” “association” “club” “foundation” “fund” “institute” “society” “union” “syndicate” “limited” or “trust” or abbreviations of the same step two creating your articles of organization after your delaware llc is named you must write your articles of organization and file a certificate of formation with the delaware secretary of state along with a 0 filing fee incfile canprovide these services for you the certificate must be executed signed by one or more authorized persons as laid out in the llc operating agreement organizers may be either natural persons or legal entities and there must be at least one organizer the certificate of formation for your new delaware llc must include the following information the llc’s name the name and street address of the llc’s resident agent see below for delaware’s rules for registered agents the duration of the llc either perpetual or for a set amount of time the certificate may also include other items that the members wish to include as long as they don’t conflict with state law even if they are also included in the operating agreement delaware registered agent rules all delaware llcs are required to have a registered instate agent this agent is the person or office designated to receive official state correspondence including notice if the llc is served with a lawsuit a registered agent in delaware may be an individual state resident a domestic corporation limited partnership llc or statutory trust or a foreign corporation limited partnership or llc authorized to do business in the state of delaware the registered office may be but is not required to be the llc’s place of business the registered agent must have a business office identical to the registered office which should generally be open during normal business hours incfile offers registered agent service for your delaware llc if needed your llc is officially “organized” once the signed original of the certificate of formation is received by the secretary of state’s office and is determined to be in compliance with state requirements step three writing your operating agreement almost as critical for the llc as the certificate of formation and articles of incorporation is the operating agreement there isn’t an official state requirement to have an operating agreement but it’s a vital internal document that specifies how your llc will operate on both the daytoday and strategic levels if there is more than one member the operating agreement must initially be approved unanimously in writing by the members the operating agreement should list the llc’s members see below for how membership works specify how much each member has invested explain how profits will be divided state how much proportional “weight” each member has when issues are voted upon unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement say otherwise voting power in a membermanaged llc is vested in each member according to his or her current capital account balance with the llc the operating agreement may also set forth meeting requirements such as the amount of required notice what constitutes a quorum voting rules and so on but they are not necessary most operating agreement list requirements for the llc that are already listed in delaware state law and regulations it can also include such items as restrictions or constraints on the power of the members to adopt amend or repeal the operating agreement unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement itself state otherwise unanimous consent of the llc’s membership is required to amend the operating agreement how membership works in a delaware llc an llc is required to have at least one member members may become a member of or acquire an interest in the llc when it is first started or when the new member’s admission is recorded in the llc’s records to join the llc the prospective member usually needs to make some kind of contribution — for example pay cash or transfer property to the llc — or undertake a binding obligation to do so a member can only resign from the llc in a manner allowed by the certificate of formation andor the operating agreement one or both of these documents will also usually state the minimum amount of time a member can maintain membership before being allowed to resign when a member resigns he or she is entitled to receive the fair value of the membership interest within a reasonable time after the resignation unless of course either the certificate of formation or operating agreement specify otherwise if the resignation or withdrawal of a member violates the provisions in the operating agreement then the amount payable to the former member is the fair market value of his interest reduced by the amount of damages sustained by the llc or its other members as a result of the violation in this case the llc may also defer the payment for as long as needed to prevent unreasonable hardship to the organization delaware’s ongoing requirements and taxes compared to many other states delaware has minimal reporting and disclosure requirements for llcs and most of those come in the form of taxes and fees all llcs and corporations formed in the state of delaware are required to file

the approach of each ongoing requirement due date dissolution of an llc in delaware an llc is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs events specified in the certificate of formation or operating agreement a unanimous member vote to dissolve unless a certain percentage or proportion is stated in the certificate of formation or operating agreement an event that makes it unlawful for the llc to continue the llc’s duration as specified in the certificate of formation or the operating agreement expires if the llc is not perpetual a court order ordering dissolution if the sole remaining member of the llc resigns or withdraws the delaware llc will automatically dissolve this dissolution may be prevented if within 0 days the personal representative of the last member agrees

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results

payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you
