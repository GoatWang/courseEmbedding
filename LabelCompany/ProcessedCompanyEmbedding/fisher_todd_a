talk log in     mueller blvdste austin tx    todd is the man after moving back to austin it took me a while to find the right barber and luckily the best one in town had just set up shop around the corner from my house the place is immaculate  definitely the style that id want to have in my own house and he always has good music on characterwise im not sure why some people have said hes an ahole is he the most affable person in the world probably not but hes hilarious and you just have to get him started one time he and i rescued some baby birds that were separated from their mother and trying to cross a busy street in front of his shop would an ahole do that ive been going every month for the last two years and i hope that he renews his lease so that i can keep going there for many years to come ive been coming to get my haircut here for a little over a year and todd never fails to make me look my absolute best i receive frequent compliments on my hair from strangers and ive referred several friends here as well todd takes great pride in his work and is very meticulous and consistent i always walk out of here feeling great and knowing i look good the shop is very clean and stylish i love the decor and music it really feels like a more classical barbershop todd keeps a supply of topnotch handpicked products in stock ive switched over to using what he carries and ive never looked back im also thoroughly impressed at todds desire to improve his craft he goes to trade shows all over the world to learn new techniques and sample the latest products it definitely shows in the quality of his haircuts too you will not be disappointed at r todd fisher ive been todds client for seven years hes the kind of man youre jealous of because he makes a living off his talent what he does for a living and what hes really good at are one and the same remarkably gifted is another way to put him ive walked into a bar and had total strangers approach me and ask whered you get your hair done for years ive received compliments from friends old and new because of his work hes not rushed hes precise meticulous the standard haircut service is a  to  minute affair he will go over time if it isnt flawless he will get the fade blend or disconnect perfect the portfolio on his site shows how well he does polished classic and modern styles not only is that true but he can just as easily do more messy and edgy looks which im often after outside of business hours hes continuing to refine his craft by traveling and attending various conferences to consume and learn as much as he can and its paid off clearly he now has his own place he chooses his own product he has his own apprentices you really ought to try him i enjoy my visits to his shop he was clearly taught the art of southern hospitality hell greet you with a hug offer you a drink in the chair hes smart has an attractive sense of humor hes conversational and charming but if all you want is to relax quietly hes just as sensitive to that as well his store is never noisy its never crowded its never rushed todd also stocks quality product including my new favorites imperial and layrite for years ive preferred kevin murphy but ive switched to both of these alternatives at his recommendation and i love them other yelpers have already mentioned the various positives and i agree clean and attractive storefront excellent taste in music selections online scheduling is easy todd will schedule for you at the store if you cant tip bring cash to avoid a small card fee when paying a final reflection on most occasions i try my best to trick todd into giving me a bad haircut its never worked ill arrive with some wild idea about what i want to try next with my hair im also a terrible communicator none of this really hinders todd in the slightest he listens talks me through it makes a couple suggestions of his own and then works his magic all these years ive never sat in the chair feeling nervous only excited and all these years ive never gotten out of the chair feeling upset only happy the two stars is for elegant interior design good music and complimentary drinks im a pretty particular guy im an eye surgeon in training a model and a man with a unique style who knows what he wants i payed up this time  vs  to experience a cut by the owner himself todd i walked in with a minimanbunlength hair and showed him multiple pictures of exactly the look i desired the style sported by christian bale in american psycho and matt bomer in white collar  both pretty consistent elegant and classic relatively longhaired looks allaround shorter than my initial length the cut i received looks like rachel maddows short on the sides  back and longer on the top still significantly shorter than my goal now shes a handsome lady and my cut is not objectively bad its just not the one i ordered imagine going to a restaurant ordering a  steak and receiving a fish filet instead will i survive and do i still look presentable yes it will however take me months to grow my hair out to my desired length the other thing that irked me is the attitude i received how old is that picture dont you want a hairdo in style i replied i have my own style the response then why are you showing me pics of someone elses todd my man a picture is worth a thousand words if i was sporting the cut in the pic i wouldnt be sitting in front of you the styles i showed you are classic and significantly more aesthetic in my eyes than the shortonthesideslongeronthetop look every hipster from here to sf  wburg is sporting the bottom line happiness is the difference between expectations and reality in medicine weve learned we can no longer get away with practicing paternalistically we have to take the patients desires into account and arrive at a shared decision before action is taken barbering is even more aestheticallyoriented just listen to your customers look at their pics and give them what they want unless they give you free rein and they will love you for it it was such a relief to find todd about a year and a half ago he is extremely detailed and consistent with his cuts ive never been disappointed and i always look forward to my appointment i seriously doubt there are many barbers in austin that can match todds expertise his shop is also immaculate and hes fun to talk to ive been getting my hair cut by todd for over five years now across three different locations my cut is fairly simple but has some challenge points that todd is able to navigate with great skill i always come out of his shop looking my best and feeling like ive had a great experience the new storefront on mueller blvd is one of the nicest barber shops ive ever seen great music complimentary drinks and classic styling enhance the overall experience i always look forward to my monthly appointments with todd for a cut and rudy for a shave and beard trim these are my spa days and a great way to step back from lifes daily stresses and just relax for a couple hours easy online scheduling is just an added benefit but be sure to book early as todds schedule fills up quickly especially if youre looking for a weekend appointment reviews here for todd alternate from great barber to total ahole and i wouldnt know about the former but i can attest to the latter the shop on mueller is nice clean and full of vinyl records appointments are relatively hassle free online these would earn stars except when youre refused service they stop mattering i asked for a cut that i could wash and go without product to which he responded then i am not your barber no warning of what might happen without product nor any sales pitch for the value of mens hair products not even a list of cuts that might work without product surely there are some he simply had me leave i took off work planned for weeks walked through the rain theres no parking in front and was rudely refused service of course in the end hes correct hes not my barber so if youre looking for a barber and you want to use buy product i guess you could go here but dont say i didnt warn you todd has been cutting my hair for  years now he is professional skilled and affordable if you are looking to maintain your style or get a new one he has done  for me todd is your guy he has never once been late or canceled on me hes good at what he does and a hoot to chat with beautiful yet manly classy shop my husband loves coming here he is always greeted in a friendly respectful manner and the prices are reasonable when first impressions mattered the most our wedding job interviews etc he trusted the team here at r todd fisher sergio was our go to guy but my husband will continue to come here go see rudy definitely attention to detail top notch place and was so glad i found this place i look forward to going back havent found a good consistent barber in vegas so looks like i will be visiting austin more often make an appointment as they are busy although they did accept me as a walkin todd is hands down the best barber i have ever been too i was in the military for seven years and had to get weekly haircuts  so ive seen my fair share of barbers i love that he takes pride in his work is extremely detail orientated doesnt rush and is great to talk too ive tried other barbers in austin and the quality of service todd provides is second to none even when he has a busy day he doesnt try to get me in and out as quick as he can previous barbers did this several times which led to a horrible cut i dont have to worry about this with todd the compliments i routinely receive from friends and colleagues demonstrate that todd consistently provides a great haircut he knows what looks good trust him and you wont be disappointed let me start by saying this is  the most soul crushing haircut ive ever received im a guy with a unique look sometimes its longer and sometimes its shorter but i have a certain look and feel to my hair  ive had it my whole life its gone now totally devastated i had longer hair going in and i asked for the same shape but within  seconds i had an electric razor shearing me like i was in the army im not the same person im not adam levine i dont like the shaved sides there was literally no warning i hate how insanely short it is so much and im forced to live with it for months and months there was no discussion just some light banter and whooosh instantly my persona is obliterated it doesnt necessarily look awful  but it isnt who i am im not a fancy hipster im not what they made me into i had a look and they killed it without second thought im a musician who plays a lot of gigs and let me tell you  ill be be wearing a beanie for a long time i played it off cool because what else am i going to do when without any warning whatsoever someone starts shaving my head once you drag those fcking shears across someones scalp theres no going back to my barber dont make irreversible changes to someone who didnt ask for them my appearance isnt something to be so reckless about seriously please for the love of god if you have longer hair or a unique look that isnt that trendy hip shaved sides thing watch out because it seems like thats all they do that being said todd himself was really nice he didnt cut my hair someone else did but todd is a cool guy i probably should have scheduled with him honestly im really upset im ashamed im awkward i lost my look and it got replaced with something i find douchey overtly trendy and unwanted if this look is up your alley thats cool thats what they advertise as and i should have been more careful but my soul just got wrecked todd has been my barber for the past year haircuts before todd were obligations the lack of consistency and attention to detail always bothered me even in top dollar premier shops frustrated i decided to see if todd could help i expressed what i wanted and todd actively listened he offered valuable feedback checked my understanding and proceeded to give me the best haircut ive ever experienced the attention to detail is unparalleled every experience afterward has remained topnotch i now anticipate appointments with todd todds personable and very genuine and on days when im feeling less conversational todd understands which i greatly appreciate the complementary trim service between appointments is a great addition and keeps me looking sharp between cuts administratively the online scheduling system is convenient and user friendly if something comes up that needs attention beyond the app todd is quick to respond todd is a really fantastic barber with excellent taste a discerning eye and an innate ability to provide a very clean sharp and symmetrical cut i went in for a haircut last year after finding him through yelp and found my new barber each of the  cuts he has provided have been fantastic and very highquality he can improve any head of hair and style but he is probably best know for haircuts for gentlemen cuts that will make a suit or business casual look really pop but still look good with bedhead and gym clothes too the shop is super clean and very comfortable and the music is usually dialedin to awesome american soul and jazz tracks that are several layers more interesting than the junkfood pop that permeates many places if youre considering giving him a try dont hesitate he gives the best mens cut in austin ive found in two decades of living here ive been going to todd for maybe two years now  since before the mueller shop  and cant imagine going anywhere else i tried a couple other premier mens barber shops before finding todd and never found the attention to detail i find here i especially love that he meticulously ensures the sidesback fade evenly an issue ive

scheduling is just an added benefit but be sure to book early as todds schedule fills up quickly especially if youre looking for a weekend appointment reviews here for todd alternate from great barber to total ahole and i wouldnt know about the former but i can attest to the latter the shop on mueller is nice clean and full of vinyl records appointments are relatively hassle free online these would earn stars except when youre refused service they stop mattering i asked for a cut that i could wash and go without product to which he responded then i am not your barber no warning of what might happen without product nor any sales pitch for the value of mens hair products not even a list of cuts that might work without product surely there are some he simply had me leave i took off work planned for weeks walked through the rain theres no parking in front and was rudely refused service of course in the end hes correct hes not my barber so if youre looking for a barber and you want to use buy product i guess you could go here but dont say i didnt warn you todd has been cutting my hair for  years now he is professional skilled and affordable if you are looking to maintain your style or get a new one he has done  for me todd is your guy he has never once been late or canceled on me hes good at what he does and a hoot to chat with beautiful yet manly classy shop my husband loves coming here he is always greeted in a friendly respectful manner and the prices are reasonable when first impressions mattered the most our wedding job interviews etc he trusted the team here at r todd fisher sergio was our go to guy but my husband will continue to come here go see rudy definitely attention to detail top notch place and was so glad i found this place i look forward to going back havent found a good consistent barber in vegas so looks like i will be visiting austin more often make an appointment as they are busy although they did accept me as a walkin todd is hands down the best barber i have ever been too i was in the military for seven years and had to get weekly haircuts  so ive seen my fair share of barbers i love that he takes pride in his work is extremely detail orientated doesnt rush and is great to talk too ive tried other barbers in austin and the quality of service todd provides is second to none even when he has a busy day he doesnt try to get me in and out as quick as he can previous barbers did this several times which led to a horrible cut i dont have to worry about this with todd the compliments i routinely receive from friends and colleagues demonstrate that todd consistently provides a great haircut he knows what looks good trust him and you wont be disappointed let me start by saying this is  the most soul crushing haircut ive ever received im a guy with a unique look sometimes its longer and sometimes its shorter but i have a certain look and feel to my hair  ive had it my whole life its gone now totally devastated i had longer hair going in and i asked for the same shape but within  seconds i had an electric razor shearing me like i was in the army im not the same person im not adam levine i dont like the shaved sides there was literally no warning i hate how insanely short it is so much and im forced to live with it for months and months there was no discussion just some light banter and whooosh instantly my persona is obliterated it doesnt necessarily look awful  but it isnt who i am im not a fancy hipster im not what they made me into i had a look and they killed it without second thought im a musician who plays a lot of gigs and let me tell you  ill be be wearing a beanie for a long time i played it off cool because what else am i going to do when without any warning whatsoever someone starts shaving my head once you drag those fcking shears across someones scalp theres no going back to my barber dont make irreversible changes to someone who didnt ask for them my appearance isnt something to be so reckless about seriously please for the love of god if you have longer hair or a unique look that isnt that trendy hip shaved sides thing watch out because it seems like thats all they do that being said todd himself was really nice he didnt cut my hair someone else did but todd is a cool guy i probably should have scheduled with him honestly im really upset im ashamed im awkward i lost my look and it got replaced with something i find douchey overtly trendy and unwanted if this look is up your alley thats cool thats what they advertise as and i should have been more careful but my soul just got wrecked todd has been my barber for the past year haircuts before todd were obligations the lack of consistency and attention to detail always bothered me even in top dollar premier shops frustrated i decided to see if todd could help i expressed what i wanted and todd actively listened he offered valuable feedback checked my understanding and proceeded to give me the best haircut ive ever experienced the attention to detail is unparalleled every experience afterward has remained topnotch i now anticipate appointments with todd todds personable and very genuine and on days when im feeling less conversational todd understands which i greatly appreciate the complementary trim service between appointments is a great addition and keeps me looking sharp between cuts administratively the online scheduling system is convenient and user friendly if something comes up that needs attention beyond the app todd is quick to respond todd is a really fantastic barber with excellent taste a discerning eye and an innate ability to provide a very clean sharp and symmetrical cut i went in for a haircut last year after finding him through yelp and found my new barber each of the  cuts he has provided have been fantastic and very highquality he can improve any head of hair and style but he is probably best know for haircuts for gentlemen cuts that will make a suit or business casual look really pop but still look good with bedhead and gym clothes too the shop is super clean and very comfortable and the music is usually dialedin to awesome american soul and jazz tracks that are several layers more interesting than the junkfood pop that permeates many places if youre considering giving him a try dont hesitate he gives the best mens cut in austin ive found in two decades of living here ive been going to todd for maybe two years now  since before the mueller shop  and cant imagine going anywhere else i tried a couple other premier mens barber shops before finding todd and never found the attention to detail i find here i especially love that he meticulously ensures the sidesback fade evenly an issue ive had in the past while his prior location was closer to where i live  work the new shop has a great vibe and is much more my style todd is very personable which is always great but he will also let me just sit there and think which i appreciate very much the ability to schedule online is a great perk as well todd says hes a perfectionist to a fault but if youre cutting hair the way he does it you kind of need to be he takes his time every time ive never seen anyone blend the sides of my hair by hand and so meticulously if you are worried about not being able to style your hair every day as good as he does it let him know and hell give you a little styling lesson also how has nobody mentioned the free whiskey  i have been looking for a great mens haircut in austin since i moved from chicago todd is the guy he does a wonderful job wth my hair and spends the time needed to get it perfect shop is clean and everyone there is friendly scheduling system is easy to use i would recommend todd to anyone who is looking for a great

you just have to get him started one time he and i rescued some baby birds that were separated from their mother and trying to cross a busy street in front of his shop would an ahole do that ive been

music and complimentary drinks im a pretty particular guy im an eye surgeon in training a model and a man with a unique style who knows what he wants i payed up this time  vs  to experience a cut by the owner himself todd i walked in with a minimanbunlength hair and showed him multiple pictures of exactly the look i desired the style sported by christian bale in american psycho and matt bomer in white collar  both pretty consistent elegant and classic relatively longhaired looks allaround shorter than my initial length the cut i received looks like rachel maddows short on the sides  back and longer on the top still significantly shorter than my goal now shes a handsome lady and my cut is not objectively bad its just not the one i ordered imagine going to a restaurant ordering a  steak and receiving a fish filet instead will i survive and do i still look presentable yes it will however take me months to grow my hair out to my desired length the other thing that irked me is the attitude i received how old is that picture dont you want a hairdo in style i replied i have my own style the response then why are you showing me pics of someone elses todd my man a picture is worth a thousand words if i was sporting the cut in the pic i wouldnt be sitting in front of you the styles i showed you are classic and significantly more aesthetic in my eyes than the shortonthesideslongeronthetop look every hipster from here to sf  wburg is sporting the bottom line happiness is the difference between expectations and reality in medicine weve learned we can no longer get away with practicing paternalistically we have to take the patients desires into account and arrive at a shared decision before action is taken barbering is even more aestheticallyoriented

barber and luckily the best one in town had just set up shop around the corner from my house the place is immaculate  definitely the style that id want to have in my own house and he always has good music on characterwise im not sure why some people have said hes an ahole is he the most affable person in the world probably not but hes hilarious and you just have to get him started one time he and i rescued some baby birds that were separated from their mother and trying to cross a busy street in front of his shop would an ahole do that ive been going every month for the last two years and i hope that he renews his lease so that i can keep going there for many years to come ive been coming to get my haircut here for a little over a year and todd never fails to make me look my absolute best i receive frequent compliments on my hair from strangers and ive referred several friends here as well todd takes great pride in his work and is very meticulous and consistent i always walk out of here feeling great and knowing i look good the shop is very clean and stylish i love the decor and music it really feels like a more classical barbershop todd keeps a supply of topnotch handpicked products in stock ive switched over to using what he carries and ive never looked back im also thoroughly impressed at todds desire to improve his craft he goes to trade shows all over the world to learn new techniques and sample the latest products it definitely shows in the quality of his haircuts too you will not be disappointed at r todd fisher ive been todds client for seven years hes the kind of man youre jealous of because he makes a living off his talent what he does for a living and what hes really good at are one and the same remarkably gifted is another way to put him ive walked into a bar and had total strangers approach me and ask whered you get your hair done for years ive received compliments from friends old and new because of his work hes not rushed hes precise meticulous the standard haircut service is a  to  minute affair he will go over time if it isnt flawless he will get the fade blend or disconnect perfect the portfolio on his site shows how well he does polished classic and modern styles not only is that true but he can just as easily do more messy and edgy looks which im often after outside of business hours hes continuing to refine his craft by traveling and attending various conferences to consume and learn as much as he can and its paid off clearly he now has his own place he chooses his own product he has his own apprentices you really ought to try him i enjoy my visits to his shop he was clearly taught the art of southern hospitality hell greet you with a hug offer you a drink in the chair hes smart has an attractive sense of humor hes conversational and charming but if all you want is to relax quietly hes just as sensitive to that as well his store is never noisy its never crowded its never rushed todd also stocks quality product including my new favorites imperial and layrite for years ive preferred kevin murphy but ive switched to both of these alternatives at his recommendation and i love them other yelpers have already mentioned the various positives and i agree clean and attractive storefront excellent taste in music selections online scheduling is easy todd will schedule for you at the store if you cant tip bring cash to avoid a small card fee when paying a final reflection on most occasions i try my best to trick todd into giving me a bad haircut its never worked ill arrive with some wild idea about what i want to try next with my hair im also a terrible communicator none of this really hinders todd in the slightest he listens talks me through it makes a couple suggestions of his own and then works his magic all these years ive never sat in the chair feeling nervous only excited and all these years ive never gotten out of the chair feeling upset only happy the two stars is for elegant interior design good music and complimentary drinks im a pretty particular guy im an eye surgeon in training a model and a man with a unique style who knows what he wants i payed up this time  vs  to experience a cut by the owner himself todd i walked in with a minimanbunlength hair and showed him multiple pictures of exactly the look i desired the style sported by christian bale in american psycho and matt bomer in white collar  both pretty consistent elegant and classic relatively longhaired looks allaround shorter than my initial length the cut i received looks like rachel maddows short on the sides  back and longer on the top still significantly shorter than my goal now shes a handsome lady and my cut is not objectively bad its just not the one i ordered imagine going to a restaurant ordering a  steak and receiving a fish filet instead will i survive and do i still look presentable yes it will however take me months to grow my hair out to my desired length the other thing that irked me is the attitude i received how old is that picture dont you want a hairdo in style i replied i have my own style the response then why are you showing me pics of someone elses todd my man a picture is worth a thousand words if i was sporting the cut in the pic i wouldnt be sitting in front of you the styles i showed you are classic and significantly more aesthetic in my eyes than the shortonthesideslongeronthetop look every hipster from here to sf  wburg is sporting the bottom line happiness is the difference between expectations and reality in medicine weve learned we can no longer get away with practicing paternalistically we have to take the patients desires into account and arrive at a shared decision before action is taken barbering is even more aestheticallyoriented just listen to your customers look at their pics and give them what they want unless they give you free rein and they will love you for it it was such a relief to find todd about a year and a half ago he is extremely detailed and consistent with his cuts ive never been disappointed and i always look forward to my appointment i seriously doubt there are many barbers in austin that can match todds expertise his shop is also immaculate and hes fun to talk to ive been getting my hair cut by todd for over five years now across three different locations my cut is fairly simple but has some challenge points that todd is able to navigate with great skill i always come out of his shop looking my best and feeling like ive had a great experience the new storefront on mueller blvd is one of the nicest barber shops ive ever seen great music complimentary drinks and classic styling enhance the overall experience i always look forward to my monthly appointments with todd for a cut and rudy for a shave and beard trim these are my spa days and a great way to step back from lifes daily stresses and just relax for a couple hours easy online scheduling is just an added benefit but be sure to book early as todds schedule fills up quickly especially if youre looking for a weekend appointment reviews here for todd alternate from great barber to total ahole and i wouldnt know about the former but i can attest to the latter the shop on mueller is nice clean and full of vinyl records appointments are relatively hassle free online these would earn stars except when youre refused service they stop mattering i asked for a cut that i could wash and go without product to which he responded then i am not your barber no warning of what might happen without product nor any sales pitch for the value of mens hair products not even a list of cuts that might work without product surely there are some he simply had me leave i took off work planned for weeks walked through the rain theres no parking in front and was rudely refused service of course in the end hes correct hes not my barber so if youre looking for a barber and you want to use buy product i guess you could go here but dont say i didnt warn you todd has been cutting my hair for  years now he is professional skilled and affordable if you are looking to maintain your style or get a new one he has done  for me todd is your guy he has never once been late or canceled on me hes good at what he does and a hoot to chat with beautiful yet manly classy shop my husband loves coming here he is always greeted in a friendly respectful manner and the prices are reasonable when first impressions mattered the most our wedding job interviews etc he trusted the team here at r todd fisher sergio was our go to guy but my husband will continue to come here go see rudy definitely attention to detail top notch place and was so glad i found this place i look forward to going back havent found a good consistent barber in vegas so looks like i will be visiting austin more often make an appointment as they are busy although they did accept me as a walkin todd is hands down the best barber i have ever been too i was in the military for seven years and had to get weekly haircuts  so ive seen my fair share of barbers i love that he takes pride in his work is extremely detail orientated doesnt rush and is great to talk too ive tried other barbers in austin and the quality of service todd provides is second to none even when he has a busy day he doesnt try to get me in and out as quick as he can previous barbers did this several times which led to a horrible cut i dont have to worry about this with todd the compliments i routinely receive from friends and colleagues demonstrate that todd consistently provides a great haircut he knows what looks good trust him and you wont be disappointed let me start by saying this is  the most soul crushing haircut ive ever received im a guy with a unique look sometimes its longer and sometimes its shorter but i have a certain look and feel to my hair  ive had it my whole life its gone now totally devastated i had longer hair going in and i asked for the same shape but within  seconds i had an electric razor shearing me like i was in the army im not the same person im not adam levine i dont like the shaved sides there was literally no warning i hate how insanely short it is so much and im forced to live with it for months and months there was no discussion just some light banter and whooosh instantly my persona is obliterated it doesnt necessarily look awful  but it isnt who i am im not a fancy hipster im not what they made me into i had a look and they killed it without second thought im a musician who plays a lot of gigs and let me tell you  ill be be wearing a beanie for a long time i played it off cool because what else am i going to do when without any warning whatsoever someone starts shaving my head once you drag those fcking shears across someones scalp theres no going back to my barber dont make irreversible changes to someone who didnt ask for them my appearance isnt something to be so reckless about seriously please for the love of god if you have longer hair or a unique look that isnt that trendy hip shaved sides thing watch out because it seems like thats all they do that being said todd himself was really nice he didnt cut my hair someone else did but todd is a cool guy i probably should have scheduled with him honestly im really upset im ashamed im awkward i lost my look and it got replaced with something i find douchey overtly trendy and unwanted if this look is up your alley thats cool thats what they advertise as and i should have been more careful but my soul just got wrecked todd has been my barber for the past year haircuts before todd were obligations the lack of consistency and attention to detail always bothered me even in top dollar premier shops frustrated i decided to see if todd could help i expressed what i wanted and todd actively listened he offered valuable feedback checked my understanding and proceeded to give me the best haircut ive ever experienced the attention to detail is unparalleled every experience afterward has remained topnotch i now anticipate appointments with todd todds personable and very genuine and on days when im feeling less conversational todd understands which i greatly appreciate the complementary trim service between appointments is a great addition and keeps me looking sharp between cuts administratively the online scheduling system is convenient and user friendly if something comes up that needs attention beyond the app todd is quick to respond todd is a really fantastic barber with excellent taste a discerning eye and an innate ability to provide a very clean sharp and symmetrical cut i went in for a haircut last year after finding him through yelp and found my new barber each of the  cuts he has provided have been fantastic and very highquality he can improve any head of hair and style but he is probably best know for haircuts for gentlemen cuts that will make a suit or business casual look really pop but still look good with bedhead and gym clothes too the shop is super clean and very comfortable and the music is usually dialedin to awesome american soul and jazz tracks that are several layers more interesting than the junkfood pop that permeates many places if youre considering giving him a try dont hesitate he gives the best mens cut in austin ive found in two decades of living here ive been going to todd for maybe two years now  since before the mueller shop  and cant imagine going anywhere else i tried a couple other premier mens barber shops before finding todd and never found the attention to detail i find here i especially love that he meticulously ensures the sidesback fade evenly an issue ive had in the past while his prior location was closer to where i live  work the new shop has a great vibe and is much more my style todd is very personable which is always great but he will also let me just sit there and think which i appreciate very much the ability to schedule online is a great perk as well todd says hes a perfectionist to a fault but if youre cutting hair the way he does it you kind of need to be he takes his time every time ive never seen anyone blend the sides of my hair by hand and so meticulously if you are worried about not being able to style your hair every day as good as he does it let him know and hell give you a little styling lesson also how has nobody mentioned the free whiskey  i have been looking for a great mens haircut in austin since i moved from chicago todd is the guy he does a wonderful job wth my hair and spends the time needed to get it perfect shop is clean and everyone there is friendly scheduling system is easy to use i would recommend todd to anyone who is looking for a great haircut and good conversation while he is doing it this is the best haircut youll ever get the reviews are real the barbers are great and this shop is my hands down favorite barber in the us sirjoe entertained me with witty barber banter while meticulously going through my difficult hair adding character with each snip go to floyds if you want a beer and a bad haircut come to r todd fishers if you want to look like a man rtodd fisher is hands down one of the best barber establishments i have been to i have been going to todd for over a year now and i know that there is no other place id rather go the professionalism attention to detail most up to date hair styles and not to mention the immaculate upscale space the shop is located are just a few of the observations youll encounter during your visit appointments are easily scheduled online and you even get a reminder email the day before your appointment the hospitality is amazing also upon walking through the door you are greeted by the staff and offered a beverage of choice while you wait ive never been  satisfied with a hair stylist as i am with todd todd is an amazing barber and his attention to detail is impeccable i always leave with a smile on my
