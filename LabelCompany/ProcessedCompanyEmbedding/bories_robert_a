resource for sights hotels restaurants bars what to do and see the frigorifico at pto bories balmaceda glacier in the distance robert runyard puerto bories is located about  km to the northwest of puerto natales in the ultima esperanza province of chiles xii region it was founded as a company town for the sociedad explotadora tierra del fuego setf in about  although the site had been previously used for other smaller scale operations including a tallowproduction activity and a small sawmill  the setf operation locally known as the frigorifico freezer plant consisted of a processing center for the large sheep stations estancias in the surrounding parts of chile and argentina and the products included mutton fat tallow wool hides and the tripas offal from sheep production  the setf operation contained its own power generation which at first was fired by coal and wood and later by natural gas that was and is available in the region the coal and gas fired steam boilers powered an electrical generation system as well as the extensive refrigeration works necessary to freeze the meat products that were held for periods of time awaiting ships that would transport these products to markets primarily in the united kingdom  although the setf was locally incorporated in chile the bulk of the management and technology and capital was british or from the british commonwealth  a small residential community was established surrounding the industrial plant and included housing for the managers and senior technical personnel who were mostly though not exclusively british there were also tennis courts and a swimming pool and even a radio station  later a hotel the hotel cisne de cuello negro was added and it is still in operation the name of the hotel derives from the black necked swan which is commonly seen in the waters near bories and elsewhere in southern chile today the frigorifico at puerto bories is a national monument and museum  guided tours are available for a nominal fee and these allow visitors to view the largest and best preserved operation of its type in all of patagonia the nearby residential area or villa frigorifico bories is privately owned but with the white chimneys and picket fences the houses here recall the style and times of a small british outpost part or or all of this text stems from the original article at robert runyard

“wonderfully drinkable” gambero rosso when gambero rosso’s annual wine guide drops the italian wine world stops as winemakers scan the influential italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is a perennial gambero favorite having earned multiple “due bicchieri” “two glasses” honors in addition to praise as a “sincere wonderfully drinkable wine” the wine access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent  vintage by the case the land of badia di morrona in the picturesque hills between florence and pisa was first worked by th century benedictine monks today it is owned by count gaslini alberti who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past  years outfitting winemaker corrado dal piaz with a refurbished facility enlarged cellars and new casks and barrels dal piaz is notoriously hard on the badia’s  acres of grapes which soak up the sun on south and southeastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone he tightened spacing in the vines orchestrating a darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skintojuice ratio the result is sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity ’s long growing season allowed temperamental sangiovese to reach rare almost perfectly uniform maturity the vines stretched deep underground sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil putting out a dark crushedredfruit sangiovese infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins if you’re looking for vibrancy in your topclass chianti you’ll be hardpressed to find anything quite like this luscious  at  and as gambero rosso would advise this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation tasting notes wineaccess travel log the  badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is bright ruby to the edge with a fabulous

producing different grapes and different styles of wine the distinction between old world wine regions and new world wine regions is particularly important as a sweeping generalization old world regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven while new world regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity for example cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in france will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors while cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in california will likely produce wines that are more fruitforward but different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes for example within france bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc grapes while burgundy is associated with red wines made from the pinot noir grape use this page to find toprated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each
