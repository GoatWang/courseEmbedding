physical scientist in the climate and radiation laboratory crl since  dr levy is focused on retrieving global aerosol properties from satellite observations and using the retrieved products for quantifying the role of aerosols in climate and air quality  he is responsible for maintaining the darktarget aerosol retrieval for modis and applying it to viirs and other sensors to create a longterm global aerosol record dr levy’s research has ranged from applications of new algorithm development monitoring surface air quality aerosolcloud interactions and aerosol trends his publication list and citation metrics can be found at researcherid current projects fine tuning the modis dark target aerosol algorithm and products comprehensive error analysis i am pi of this terraaquaexisting data products proposal  the goal is to maintain and continue to improve the modis darktarget aerosol product primary tasks include developing a perpixel retrieval uncertainty product removing retrieval bias over urban areas and moving towards greater data fusion with other satellite datasets and models towards a consistent aerosol data record created from modis viirs and beyond i am pi of this project as part of the suominpp science team  the goal is to apply the modis darktarget aerosol retrieval algorithm to viirs in order to create a continuous aerosol data record  studying aerosol in cloud fields using mas data from seacrs and previous field campaigns i am pi of this nasafunded opportunity for atmospheric composition campaign data analysis and modeling  we are porting the modis aerosol darktarget algorithm to use airborne emas observations  starting with the recent seacrs experiment we are looking to characterize aerosol in cloud fields at high resolution study of aerosol properties in the vicinity of clouds using multiplatform and multisensor data fusion i am coi on this nasafunded project aimed at enhancing the science of terra and aqua our work will be characterize
