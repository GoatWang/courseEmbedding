we do or adheres to such high standards to produce quality artisan breads” felix barats master baker owner chicago specialty bakers bensenville il prweb august   felix barats’ highly regarded chicago specialty bakers is on the fast track as he expands his artisan bread baking business to more domestic and international air lines specialty supermarket and grocery stores food service operations and cafe and restaurant chains while strengthening sales of his customized eastern european and german rye breads it is buoying expectations the artisanal baker’s traditiontrue dark colored coriander spicetopped sweetsour flavored russian rye the “borodinsky” will become the next big thing in the us marketplace since the italian ciabatta and the reason lies with barats the speciallytrained creative handson detailoriented company owner and masterbaker who is so devoted and dedicated to his craft he uses the best ingredients and processes possible to produce the highest quality products enjoyed by high ranking government officials international travelers an exacting ethnic audience in search of specific european tastes they know and love and discerning onthego consumers notably nato summit  dignitaries enjoyed specialty breads produced by chicago specialty bakers on most flights into and out of chicago “no one goes to the lengths we do or adheres to such high standards to produce quality artisan breads” said barats bread maven extraordinaire celebrating  years in the bakery business barats’ experience and expertise in the baking business has given rise to his aggressive expansion that includes constructing next year a new multimillion dollar production facility doubling the size of current bensenville il operations and featuring the latest technological advances and stateofthe art baking equipment with an industry trend caused by an uncertain economy that finds many bakeries succumbing to the pressure to sell to bigger entities who strictly adhere to the bottom line administered by accountants with less attention paid to quality barats not only is keeping his bread making business lean but solidifying his position as the main contact the goto guy for current and prospective clients providing his experience and expertise when you do business with chicago specialty bakers you do business directly and exclusively with the internationallyknown barats who demonstrates every day his customerisking approach barats every year returns to europe – especially france and germany – for special ongoing training to hone his artisanal baking skills and to discover the latest baking technologies and equipment he is completely confident even in this down economy of reaching his next goal that of turning his “borodinsky” into the industry’s next significant trend barats receives a hero’s welcome in russia when he returns fully armed with the “borodinsky” – a russian treasure – to visit family he is overwhelmed by the response and the accolades for the taste he produces “we are the only major wholesale artisan bakery of its kind in this country to use  per cent rye flour and a yearold rye levain which is superior to yeast as a leavening agent we make the ‘borodinsky’ the most popular bread in russia the same exact way they make it there ours is ‘america’s borodinsky’” he said handling both smaller custom and high volume specialty orders with equal excellence in quality and service has helped put chicago specialty bakers on the map expansion and the enhanced capabilities it brings not only will more than double its current daily output of fresh breads dinner rolls frenchstyle baguettes ciabatta focaccia and pretzel hamburger and sandwich buns but will enable it to make an even better product to meet the needs of its growing customer base “we are custom artisan bakers” said barats “we only produce products when a customer’s order comes in we meet with them to learn what their needs are and make bread for them to achieve their goals” patrons of well known chicago area specialty supermarkets and grocery store chains such as fresh farms international market garden fresh market and joe caputo  sons fruit

investment firm he believes is one to keep an eye on scott matusow baker brothers is becoming a wellknown and respected biotech longside investing institution  lane erickson  fotoliacom perhaps the most important buying indicator for a developmental pharma is who is buying the stock at stockmatusow we have had the most success with our trades and investments when we “follow the smart money” when push comes to shove we follow the smart money—period baker brothers llc is perhaps the smartest of money in the small cap developmental biotech space the firm is fast becoming a wellknown biotech longside investing institution that is well respected the company was founded in the year  and is run by brothers julian c baker and felix baker phd acadia and halozyme last year the bakers made a significant bet on acadia pharma acad when the stock was selling for under  per share on november   the company reported positive data results for its drug pimavanserin which is designed to treat parkinson’s disease psychosis pdp the news prompted a huge rally in the stock that has mostly continued to this day since pdp is a serious unmet need the speculation continues to swell around acadia and eventual fda approval—which could come in —would further rally the stock perhaps even  or higher from its current level the baker brothers are up well over  in acadia since their initial investment perhaps the most interesting of their buys in  could be halozyme halo halozyme engages in the research development and commercialization of human enzymes its research focuses on human enzymes that transiently modify tissue under the skin to facilitate the delivery of injected drugs and fluids or to alter abnormal tissue structures for clinical benefit along with a large increase in acadia shares the bakers have recently more than doubled their initial investment in halozyme and it has paid off as the stock has more than tripled in  halozyme has several catalysts yet to come in the short term and at stockmatusow we feel the stock could be a double gainer in  which will further add to the baker brothers gain they have already enjoyed in  progenics another interesting company which the bakers have a large position in which also has an important catalyst coming up in q—a tentative advisory panel meeting in march th–th to review an snda for relistor expanded usage in oic opioid induced constipation chronic pain—is progenics pgnx progenics engages in the research and development of biotechnology product candidates in the areas of oncology and therapeutics we have followed the baker’s lead with progenics as we believe the stock could double or more in  the company has several interesting products in development and good company structure additionally progenics also is expecting to announce data from its phase ii psma adc trial at the american society of clinical oncology meeting in january  the bakers like to buy biotechs with nearterm catalysts and they have experienced great success earning themselves and their client’s huge returns in a short period of time with a nearterm major catalyst coming for progenics the company certainly fits the baker brothers’ bill the bakers own a little over four million shares of progenics and we believe their position in this one will eventually pay off very well not all of them can be winners while the bakers are not right on every one of their investments they get an overwhelming majority of them correct one of their large positions recently suffered a large drop in price when ariad pharma aria reported a major issue with its drug iclusig falling as much as  after announcing the discontinuation of a latestage trial for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia the company reported a high number of arterial thromobotic events otherwise known as “blood clots” ariad’s stock has dropped over  from its week high of around  this is a rare case for the bakers but no one gets every pick right still the bakers are about the best there is the bakers have been a great lead for us to follow at stockmatusow and we will continue to follow their lead as they have proven to be very smart money we will
