of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds the optical networking industry is extremely competitive with many large vendors of optical networking products and is characterized by continuous innovation several of our competitors have preferred supplier relationships with service providers as the demand for bandwidth has increased the need for different technologies to satisfy these needs has become more acute the development of next generation technologies however is a costly timeconsuming endeavor we believe our patented technologies provide the highest reach and capacity in the industry and give us substantial advantages over our competition further we believe focusing on technologies such as gbps roadm and packet optical transport systems with a focus on simplifying the transition to higher bandwidth optical networks provides us with a competitive advantage over our competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include price product performance technology compatibility quality ability to meet customer specifications time to market time to delivery technical support capabilities breadth of product offerings and record of innovation we believe that our optical networking solutions compare favorably to our competitors’ products in the markets in which we compete our primary competitors in the submarine market include alcatellucent submarine networks sas coriant gmbh huawei marine networks co limited nec corporation and te subcom a te connectivity ltd company in the terrestrial market our primary competitors include alcatellucent sa ciena corporation huawei technologies co ltd infinera corporation and coriant gmbh many of our competitors have significantly more financial technical marketing and other resources than we have may devote greater resources to the promotion sale and support of their technology than we can have more extensive customer bases than we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have in addition many of our competitors expend a greater amount of funds on research and development however we believe our reach capacity and current gbps capabilities allow us to differentiate ourselves both in terms of technology and price company description we are a leading provider of highcapacity costeffective optical transport solutions supporting the high growth in global demand for bandwidth we sell our highcapacity optical transport solutions to telecommunications service providers content service providers enterprises and government entities worldwide to support their deployments of longhaul terrestrial and submarine optical cable networks we believe that our proprietary wise raman optical amplification technology allows for capacity and reach performance advantages over competitive products that are based upon conventional erbiumdoped fiber amplifier or edfa technology we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our innovative proprietary products and our industryleading costefficient operating structure we have developed a portfolio of intellectual property with more
