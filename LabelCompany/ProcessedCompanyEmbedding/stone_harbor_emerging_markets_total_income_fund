harbor funds  disclosure home what is emd our funds edi edf about stone harbor our people contact us stone harbor investment partners lp disclosure investing in the fund involves risks including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment therefore before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in the funds common shares see the section entitled principal risk factors for a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in the funds common shares nondiversified status as a nondiversified investment company under the investment company act of  the  act the fund is not limited in the proportion of its assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer and accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund because the fund as a nondiversified investment company may invest in a smaller number of individual issuers than a diversified investment company an investment in the fund may under certain circumstances present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified investment company because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the funds nav notwithstanding its status as a nondiversified investment company the fund intends to conduct its operations so as to meet the diversification requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company which generally will relieve the fund of any liability for us federal income tax to the extent its earnings are timely distributed to shareholders see us federal income tax matters no operating history the fund is a newly organized nondiversified closedend investment company with no history of operations and is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business an investment in the funds common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest see also investment and market risk management risk the funds ability to identify and invest in attractive opportunities is dependent upon the investment manager if one or more key individuals leave the investment manager it may not be able to hire qualified replacements or may require an extended time to do so which may adversely affect the funds ability to achieve its investment objective thomas brock the investment managers chief executive officer will retire on december   mr brock does not serve as a portfolio manager of the fund upon his retirement his duties with the investment manager will be assumed by an executive management committee although the investment manager is the adviser to several registered openend funds the fund is one of the first closedend funds to be managed by the investment manager in addition the investment manager does not have an established performance record investing in equity securities as with any managed fund the investment manager may not be successful in selecting the bestperforming securities leverage strategy or investment techniques and the funds performance may lag behind that of similar funds as a result asset allocation risk the funds investment performance depends in part upon how its assets are allocated and reallocated by the investment manager the investment performance of the fund may be adversely affected if the investment manager allocates a significant portion of the funds assets to a country industry or sector asset class or subset of an asset class that performs poorly including relative to other asset classes or subsets of asset classes in addition the investment managers assessment of the relative value of a particular country industry or sector asset class or subset of an asset class may prove incorrect resulting in the funds experiencing losses or poor performance investment and market risk an investment in common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested an investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities and other financial assets owned by the fund securities held by the fund are generally traded in overthecounter markets the value of these securities and financial assets like other market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably the common shares at any point in time may be worth less than their original cost even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions further the value of securities held by the fund may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries investments in foreign securities investing in foreign securities or issuers with significant exposure to foreign markets involves certain special considerations that are not typically associated with investments in the securities of us issuers foreign issuers are not generally subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and may have policies that are not comparable to those of domestic issuers as a result there may be less information available about foreign issuers than about domestic issuers securities of some foreign issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities markets brokers and issuers in nonus countries than in the united states in addition with respect to certain foreign countries there is a possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation political social andor financial instability or adverse diplomatic developments which could adversely affect the value of investments in those countries the costs of investing in foreign countries frequently are higher than the costs of investing in the united states although the investment manager endeavors to achieve the most favorable execution costs in portfolio transactions trading costs in nonus securities markets are generally higher than trading costs in the united states investments in securities of foreign issuers often will be denominated in foreign currencies accordingly the value of the funds assets as measured in us dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates and in exchange control regulations the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies see foreign currency risk certain foreign governments levy withholding or other taxes on dividend and interest income or on the sale or other disposition of foreign securities although in some countries a portion of these taxes are recoverable the nonrecovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries from time to time the fund may invest in certain sovereign debt obligations that are issued by or in certain companies that operate in or have dealings with countries that thereafter become subject to sanctions or embargoes imposed by the us government and the united nations andor that the us government identifies as state sponsors of terrorism investments in such countries or companies may be adversely affected because for example the credit rating of the sovereign debt security may be lowered due to the countrys instability or unreliability or the company may suffer damage to its reputation if it is identified as a company which operates in or has dealings with such countries as an investor in such companies the fund will be indirectly subject to those risks and may be required to dispose of such investments at a time when it may not be advantageous to do so back to the top investments in emerging market countries investing in the securities of issuers located in emerging market countries involves special considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of other foreign or us issuers including heightened risks of expropriation andor nationalization armed conflict confiscatory taxation restrictions on transfers of assets lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations the economies of individual emerging market countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rate of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position governments of many emerging market countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in some cases the government owns or controls many companies including some of the largest in the country accordingly government actions could have a significant effect on economic conditions in an emerging market country and on market conditions prices and yields of securities in the funds portfolio moreover the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and accordingly have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers exchange controls managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade these economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade with respect to any emerging market country there is the possibility of nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation political changes government regulation overburdened and obsolete or unseasoned financial systems environmental problems less developed legal systems economic or social instability or diplomatic developments including war which could affect adversely the economies of such countries or the value of the funds investments in those countries it also may be difficult to obtain and to enforce a judgment in a court outside of the united states in addition the interrelatedness of the economies in emerging market countries has deepened over the years with the effect that economic difficulties in one country may spread throughout a region or even among all or most emerging market countries an effect that may vitiate any attempt by the fund to reduce risk through geographic diversification of its portfolio investments investments in emerging market countries may entail purchasing securities issued by or on behalf of entities that are insolvent bankrupt in default or otherwise engaged in an attempt to reorganize or reschedule their obligations or in entities that have little or no proven credit rating or credit history in any such case the issuers poor or deteriorating financial condition may increase the likelihood that the fund will experience losses or diminution in available gains due to bankruptcy insolvency or fraud foreign currency risk the fund will invest in emerging markets securities which may include or be denominated in foreign currencies the fund is subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the value of the us dollar the values of the currencies of the emerging market countries in which the fund may invest may be subject to a high degree of fluctuation due to changes in interest rates the effects of the monetary policies of the united states foreign governments central banks or supranational entities the imposition of currency controls or other national or global political or economic developments therefore the funds exposure to foreign currencies may result in losses to the fund the fund will compute and expects to distribute its income in us dollars and the computation of income is made on the date that the income is earned by the fund at the foreign exchange rate in effect on that date if the value of the foreign currencies in which the fund receives its income falls relative to the us dollar between the earning of the income and the time at which the fund converts the foreign currencies to us dollars the fund will realize foreign currency losses for us federal income tax purposes see us federal income tax matters the fund may be required to liquidate securities in order to make distributions if the fund has insufficient cash in us dollars to meet distribution requirements see distributions and dividend reinvestment plan the liquidation of investments if required may have an adverse effect on the funds performance since the fund may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the value of securities in the funds portfolio and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments in addition to changes in the value of the funds portfolio investments resulting from currency fluctuations the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies foreign exchange dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies thus a dealer normally will offer to sell a foreign currency to the fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the fund desire immediately to resell that currency to the dealer the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or in the derivatives markets including through entering into forward futures or options contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies currency exchange rates may be negatively affected by rates of inflation interest rate levels balance of payments and governmental surpluses or deficits in the countries in which the fund invests the currencies of countries may experience significant declines against the us dollar and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the fund inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain countries governments that issue obligations may engage in certain techniques to control the value of their local currencies such techniques include central bank intervention imposition of regulatory controls or the imposition of taxes that may affect the exchange rates of the local currencies in which the debt securities are denominated countries may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or may devalue their currencies the liquidity and market values of the funds investments may be affected by the actions of the governments of the countries in which the fund invests the fund may be negatively affected by developments associated with the euro see redenomination risk below the fund may from time to time seek to protect the value of some portion or all of its portfolio holdings against currency risks by engaging in currency hedging transactions such transactions may include entering into forward currency exchange contracts currency futures contracts and options on such futures contracts the use of other derivatives as well as purchasing put or call options on currencies in us or foreign markets currency hedging involves special risks including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the investment managers view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of hedging could result in losses greater than if they had not been used in addition in certain countries in which the fund may invest currency hedging opportunities may not be available sovereign debt obligations risk investments in countries government debt obligations involve special risks certain countries have historically experienced and may continue to experience high rates of inflation high interest rates exchange rate fluctuations large amounts of external debt balance of payments and trade difficulties and extreme poverty and unemployment the issuer or governmental authority that controls the repayment of a countrys debt may not be able or willing to repay the principal andor interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt a debtors willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation and in the case of a government debtor the extent of its foreign reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole the government debtors policy towards the international monetary fund and the political constraints to which a government debtor may be subject government debtors may default on their debt and may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments multilateral agencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt the commitment on the part of these governments agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a debtors implementation of economic reforms andor economic performance and the timely service of such debtors obligations failure to implement such reforms achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties commitments to lend funds to the government debtor which may further impair such debtors ability or willingness to service its debts on a timely basis holders of government debt including the fund may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to government debtors as a result of the foregoing a government obligor may default on its obligations if such an event occurs the fund may have limited legal recourse against the issuer andor guarantor remedies must in some cases be pursued in the courts of the defaulting party itself and the ability of the holder of foreign government debt securities to obtain recourse may be subject to the political climate in the relevant country in addition no assurance can be given that the holders of more senior fixed income securities such as commercial bank debt will not contest payments to the holders of other foreign government debt securities in the event of default under their commercial bank loan agreements government obligors in emerging market countries are among the worlds largest debtors to commercial banks other governments international financial organizations and other financial institutions the issuers of the government debt securities in which the fund may invest have in the past experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their external debt obligations which led to defaults on certain obligations and the restructuring of certain indebtedness restructuring arrangements have included among other things reducing and rescheduling interest and principal payments by negotiating new or amended credit agreements and obtaining new credit to finance interest payments holders of certain foreign government debt securities may be requested to participate in the restructuring of such obligations and to extend further loans to their issuers there can be no assurance that the foreign government debt securities in which the fund may invest will not be subject to similar restructuring arrangements or to requests for new credit which may adversely affect the funds holdings furthermore certain participants in the secondary market for such debt may be directly involved in negotiating the terms of these arrangements and may therefore have access to information not available to other market participants since  the risks of investing in foreign sovereign debt have increased significantly as a result of the ongoing european debt crisis which began in greece and has begun to spread throughout various other european countries these debt crises and the ongoing efforts of governments around the world to address these debt crises have also resulted in increased volatility and uncertainty in the united states and the global economy and securities markets and it is impossible to predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the united states and the global economy and securities markets or on the funds investments it is possible that these or similar events could have a significant adverse effect on the value and risk profile of the fund see redenomination risk investments in emerging market countries government debt securities involve currency risk see foreign currency risk back to the top corporate debt risks like all debt securities corporate debt securities generally represent an issuers obligation to repay to the investor or lender the amount borrowed plus interest over a specified time period a typical corporate bond specifies a fixed date when the amount borrowed principal is due in full known as the maturity date and specifies dates when periodic interest coupon payments will be made over the life of the security corporate debt securities come in many varieties and may differ in the way that interest is calculated the amount and frequency of payments the type of collateral if any and the presence of special features eg conversion rights the funds investments in corporate debt securities may include but are not limited to senior junior secured and unsecured bonds convertible securities notes and other debt securities and may be fixed rate floating rate zero coupon and inflation linked among other things prices of corporate debt securities fluctuate and in particular are subject to several key risks including but not limited to interest rate risk credit risk prepayment risk and spread risk the market value of a corporate bond may be affected by the credit rating of the issuer the issuers performance perceptions of the market place management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuers goods and services there is a risk that the issuers of the corporate debt securities in which the fund may invest may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by such securities interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that investments will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates when interest rates rise the market value of fixed income securities generally will fall and when interest rates fall the market value of such securities generally will rise the funds investment in such securities means that the nav and market price of the common shares may decline if market interest rates rise this risk may be particularly acute because market interest rates are currently at historically low levels during periods of declining interest rates an issuer of fixed income securities may exercise its option to redeem or prepay securities prior to maturity which could result in the funds having to reinvest in lower yielding fixed income securities or other types of securities this is known as call or prepayment risk during periods of rising interest rates the average life of certain types of securities may be extended because of slower than expected payments this may lock in a below market yield increase the securitys duration and reduce the value of the security this is known as extension risk investments in debt securities with longterm maturities may experience significant price declines if longterm interest rates increase this is known as maturity risk the value of the funds investments in common shares or other equity securities may also be influenced by changes in interest rates credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of for example a fixed income security or preferred stock or the counterparty to a derivatives contract will be unable to make interest principal dividend or other payments when due in general lower rated securities carry a greater degree of credit risk if rating agencies lower their ratings of securities in the funds portfolio the value of those obligations could decline in addition the underlying revenue source for a fixed income security a preferred stock or a derivatives contract may be insufficient to pay dividends interest principal or other required payments in a timely manner because a significant primary source of income for the fund is the dividend interest principal and other payments on the fixed income securities preferred stocks and derivatives in which it invests any default by an issuer of such an instrument could have a negative effect on the funds ability to pay dividends on common shares andor cause a decline in the value of fund assets even if the issuer does not actually default adverse changes in the issuers financial condition may negatively affect its credit rating or presumed creditworthiness these developments would adversely affect the market value of the issuers obligations or the value of credit derivatives if the fund has sold credit protection noninvestment grade securities risk the funds investments in fixed income securities and preferred stocks of below investment grade quality commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds are predominantly speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers while offering a greater potential opportunity for capital appreciation and higher yields such below investment grade securities entail greater potential price volatility and may be less liquid than higherrated securities issuers of below investment grade quality securities are more likely to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the fund and such defaults will reduce the funds nav and income distributions the prices of these lower quality securities are more sensitive to negative developments than higher rated securities adverse business conditions such as a decline in the issuers revenues or an economic downturn generally lead to a higher nonpayment rate in addition such a security may lose significant value before a default occurs as the market adjusts to expected higher nonpayment rates the fund may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade see credit risk equity securities and related market risk the market price of common stocks and other equity securities may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities may decline in value due to factors affecting equity securities markets generally particular industries represented in those markets or the issuer itself see issuer risk the values of equity securities may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally they also may decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry equity securities generally have greater price volatility than bonds and other debt securities back to the top issuer risk the value of securities may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer such as its financial strength management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuers goods and services as well as the historical and prospective earnings of the issuer and the value of its assets preferred securities risk investments in preferred securities are subject to many of the risks associated with both fixed income securities and common shares or other equity securities preferred securities may also contain provisions that allow an issuer under certain conditions to skip or defer dividend payments if the fund owns a preferred security that is deferring its distributions the fund may be required to report income for tax purposes while it is not receiving any distributions preferred stock in some instances is convertible into common shares or other securities see convertible securities risk etfs and other investment companies risk as an investor in an etf or other investment company the fund will be subject to the risks of the underlying securities in which the other investment company invests in addition as a shareholder in an etf or other investment company the fund will bear its ratable share of that investment companys expenses and would remain subject to payment of the funds investment management fees with respect to the assets so invested common shareholders would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other investment companies in addition these other investment companies may use leverage in which case an investment would subject the fund to additional risks associated with leverage see leverage risk the fund may invest in other investment companies for which the investment manager or an affiliate serves as investment manager or with which the investment manager is otherwise affiliated the relationship between the investment manager and any such other investment company could create a conflict of interest between the investment manager and the fund in addition to the risks related to investing in investment companies generally investments in etfs involve the risk that the etfs performance may not track the performance of the index or markets the etf is designed to track in addition etfs often use derivatives to track the performance of the relevant index and therefore investments in those etfs are subject to the same derivatives risks discussed above see derivatives risk smaller company risk the fund may invest in small or medium capitalization issuers the general risks associated with debt instruments or equity securities are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with small market capitalizations small capitalization companies involve certain special risks they are more likely than larger companies to have limited product lines markets or financial resources or to depend on a small inexperienced management group securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities they also may have limited liquidity companies with mediumsized market capitalizations may have risks similar to those of smaller companies derivatives risk generally a derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends upon or is derived from the value of an underlying asset reference rate or index and may relate to individual debt or equity instruments interest rates currencies or currency exchange rates commodities related indexes and other assets the fund may use derivatives to a significant extent for hedging investment interest rate or duration management or leverage purposes derivative transactions such as swaps options and futures contracts and options thereon may subject the fund to increased risk of principal loss due to imperfect correlation between the values of the derivatives and the underlying securities or unexpected price or interest rate movements some derivatives may be subject to central clearing while others may not if a derivative is centrally cleared a central clearing entity stands between the two parties to the trade as counterparty to each the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivatives contracts whether a clearing corporation in the case of a cleared derivative instrument or another third party in the case of an uncleared derivative instrument purchased and sold by the fund in addition to the risks associated with direct investments in the underlying reference securities currencies or other instruments if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a dissolution assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation windingup bankruptcy or other analogous reorganization proceeding in addition in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty to a derivative transaction the derivative transaction would typically be terminated at its fair market value to the extent the funds claim is unsecured the fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying security the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances see counterparty risk the funds use of derivatives can affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives may be limited by tax considerations see discussion in us federal income tax matters the use of derivatives involves costs which are ultimately borne by the fund and reduce returns derivatives involve exposure that may exceed the original cost and a small use of derivatives could result in a potentially unlimited loss to the fund under certain circumstances the use of certain derivatives may expose the fund to leverage risk see leverage risk it is possible that government regulation of various types of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps interest rate options credit linked notes foreign currency forward contracts credit default swaps and total return swaps on individual securities and groups or indices of securities may limit or prevent the fund from using such instruments as part of its investment strategy which could negatively affect the funds performance for example the us government recently enacted legislation that provides for new regulation of certain portions of the derivatives market including clearing margin reporting recordkeeping and registration requirements although the us commodity futures trading commission the cftc has released final rules relating to reporting recordkeeping and registration requirements many of the provisions contained in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act are subject to further final rule making and thus its ultimate impact remains unclear new regulations could among other things restrict the funds ability to engage in derivatives transactions for example by making certain types of derivatives transactions no longer available to the fund andor increase the costs of such derivatives transactions for example by increasing margin or capital requirements and the fund may be unable to execute its investment strategy as a result it is unclear how the regulatory changes will affect counterparty risk leverage risk although the fund presently intends to utilize leverage there can be no assurance that the fund will do so or that if utilized it will be successful during any period in which leverage is employed the use of leverage by the fund would result in more risk to the funds shareholders than if leverage had not been used and can magnify the effect of any losses if the income and gains earned on securities to which the fund has exposure through the use of leverage are greater than the costs of borrowings the costs of derivatives transactions used to generate leverage and the dividend payable on any outstanding preferred shares the funds returns will be greater than if leverage had not been used conversely if the income and gains from those securities do not cover the payments due in connection with the leverage used the return will be less than if such leverage had not been used in addition if an event of default were to occur with respect to a reference obligation on which the fund had sold a credit default swap the value of the reference obligation received by the fund if any coupled with the periodic payments previously received from the counterparty may be less than the full notional value the fund pays to the buyer in which case the investment performance of the funds common shares will underperform as compared to what the performance would have been had the fund not written any credit default swaps see credit default swaps risk for further information on the risks associated with credit default swaps the investment manager nevertheless may determine to continue to use leverage if it believes that the benefits to the fund will in the longterm outweigh the potential risk of a reduced return the expenses associated with borrowings sales of credit default swaps derivatives transactions and issuances of preferred shares will be borne by common shareholders and consequently will result in a reduction of the nav of the common shares during periods in which the fund is using leverage in the form of borrowings or preferred shares the fees paid by the fund for investment advisory and administrative services will be higher than if the fund did not use such leverage as such fees will be calculated on the basis of the funds total managed assets which includes assets attributable to any borrowings and to any preferred shares in this regard holders of debt or preferred shares do not bear such fees rather common shareholders bear the portion of such fees attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of such leverage or the investment exposure obtained through such leverage which means that common shareholders effectively bear the entirety of advisory and administrative fees back to the top short sales risk to the extent the fund makes use of short sales for investment andor risk management purposes the fund may be subject to certain risks associated with selling short short sales are transactions in which the fund sells securities or other instruments that the fund does not own short sales expose the fund to the risk that it will be required to cover its short position at a time when the securities have appreciated in value thus resulting in a loss to the fund the fund may engage in short sales when it does not own or have the right to acquire the security sold short at no additional cost the funds loss on a short sale theoretically could be unlimited in a case in which the fund is unable for whatever reason to close out its short position in addition the funds short selling strategies may limit its ability to benefit from increases in the markets if the fund engages in short sales it will segregate liquid assets enter into offsetting transactions or own positions covering its obligations however such segregation and cover requirements will not limit or offset losses on related positions also there is the risk that the counterparty to a short sale may fail to honor its contractual terms causing a loss to the fund risks of short economic exposure through derivatives the use by the fund of derivatives such as options forwards or futures contracts for investment andor risk management purposes may subject the fund to risks associated with short economic exposure taking a short economic position through derivatives exposes the fund to the risk that it will be obligated to make payments to its counterparty if the underlying asset appreciates in value resulting in a loss to the fund the funds loss on a short position using derivatives theoretically could be unlimited credit default swaps risk credit default swaps involve greater risks than investing in the reference obligation directly in addition to general market risks credit default swaps are subject to liquidity risk counterparty risk and credit risk a buyer will lose its investment and recover nothing should no event of default occur if an event of default were to occur the value of the reference obligation received by the seller if any coupled with the periodic payments previously received may be less than the full notional value it pays to the buyer resulting in a loss of value to the seller when the fund acts as a seller of a credit default swap it is exposed to many of the same risks of leverage described herein since if an event of default occurs the seller must pay the buyer the full notional value of the reference obligation although the fund will seek to realize gains by writing credit default swaps that increase in value to realize gains on writing credit default swaps an active secondary market for such instruments must exist or the fund must otherwise be able to close out these transactions at advantageous times if no such secondary market exists or the fund is otherwise unable to close out these transactions at advantageous times writing credit default swaps may not be profitable for the fund the market for credit default swaps has become more volatile in recent years as the creditworthiness of certain counterparties has been questioned andor downgraded the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contract whether a clearing corporation in the case of a cleared credit default swap or another third party in the case of an uncleared credit default swap if a counterpartys credit becomes significantly impaired multiple requests for collateral posting in a short period of time could increase the risk that the fund may not receive adequate collateral as of the date of this prospectus credit default swaps are not currently traded on any securities exchange however the cftc has issued a proposed rule which would require certain credit default swaps to be cleared through swaps clearing houses the fund may exit its obligations under a credit default swap only by terminating the contract and paying applicable breakage fees or by entering into an offsetting credit default swap position which may cause the fund to incur more losses redenomination risk continuing uncertainty as to the status of the euro and the european monetary union the emu has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally any partial or complete dissolution of the emu could have significant adverse effects on currency and financial markets and on the values of the funds portfolio investments especially any investments denominated in euros as a result the value of those investments could decline significantly and unpredictably in addition securities or other investments that are redenominated may be subject to foreign currency risk liquidity risk and valuation risk to a greater extent than similar investments currently denominated in euros see foreign currency risk liquidity risk and valuation risk to the extent a currency used for redenomination purposes is not specified in respect of certain eurorelated investments or should the euro cease to be used entirely the currency in which such investments are denominated may be unclear making such investments particularly difficult to value or dispose of the fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek judicial or other clarification of the denomination or value of such securities reinvestment risk income from the funds portfolio will decline if and when the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called debt obligations at market interest rates that are below the portfolios current earnings rate for instance during periods of declining interest rates an issuer of debt obligations may exercise an option to redeem securities prior to maturity forcing the fund to reinvest the proceeds in loweryielding securities a decline in income received by the fund from its investments is likely to have a negative effect on the market price net asset value andor overall return of the common shares hedging strategy risk certain of the investment techniques that the fund may employ for hedging will expose the fund to additional or increased risks there may be an imperfect correlation between changes in the value of the funds portfolio holdings and hedging positions entered into by the fund which may prevent the fund from achieving the intended hedge or expose the fund to risk of loss in addition the funds success in using hedge instruments is subject to the investment managers ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedge instruments to the funds portfolio holdings and there can be no assurance that the investment managers judgment in this respect will be accurate consequently the use of hedging transactions might result in a poorer overall performance for the fund whether or not adjusted for risk than if the fund had not hedged its portfolio holdings the investment manager is under no obligation to engage in any hedging strategies and may in its discretion choose not to even if the investment manager desires to hedge some of the funds risks suitable hedging transactions may not be available or if available attractive a failure to hedge may result in losses to the value of the funds investments back to the top counterparty risk the fund is subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts whether a clearing corporation in the case of cleared instruments or another third party in the case of uncleared instruments and other instruments entered into by the fund or held by special purpose or structured vehicles in which the fund invests in the event that the fund enters into a derivative transaction with a counterparty that subsequently becomes insolvent or becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case the derivative transaction may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the funds ability to realize its rights under the derivative instrument and its ability to distribute the proceeds could be adversely affected to the extent the funds claim is unsecured the fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying security if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a dissolution assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation windingup bankruptcy or other analogous reorganization proceeding the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances net asset value discount risk frequently shares of closedend investment companies such as the fund trade at a price below their nav commonly referred to as a discount the fund cannot predict whether or to what extent its common shares will trade at a discount to their nav immediately following this offering the nav of the funds common shares will be reduced by offering costs paid by the fund creating an increased risk that the common shares will trade at a discount to their nav for a period following the offering therefore there is an added risk to investors who may sell their shares shortly after the offering before making an investment decision a prospective investor should consider the suitability of this investment with respect to the investors investment objectives and personal situation see description of shares structured products risk structured products risk the fund may invest in structured investments structured notes and other similar products consistent with the funds investment objective and policies generally structured investments are interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of underlying investment interests or securities these investment entities may be structured as trusts or other types of pooled investment vehicles this type of restructuring generally involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity of the underlying investments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by or representing interests in the underlying investments or referencing an indicator related to such investments the cash flow or rate of return on the underlying investments may be apportioned among the newly issued securities to create different investment characteristics such as varying maturities credit quality payment priorities and interest rate provisions structured notes are derivative securities for which the amount of principal repayment andor interest payments is based on the movement of one or more factors these factors may include but are not limited to currency exchange rates interest rates such as the prime lending rate or the london interbank offered rate libor referenced bonds and stock indices some of these factors may or may not correlate to the total rate of return on one or more underlying instruments referenced in such notes in some cases the effect of the movements of these factors may increase or decrease through the use of multipliers or deflators the cash flow or rate of return on a structured investment may be determined by applying a multiplier to the rate of total return on the underlying investments or referenced indicator application of a multiplier is comparable to the use of financial leverage a speculative technique leverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss as a result a relatively small decline in the value of the underlying investments or referenced indicator could result in a relatively large loss in the value of a structured product holders of structured products indirectly bear risks associated with the underlying investments index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk the fund generally has the right to receive payments to which it is entitled only from the structured product and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer while certain structured investment vehicles enable the investor to acquire interests in a pool of securities without the brokerage and other expenses associated with directly holding the same securities investors in structured vehicles generally pay their share of the investment vehicles administrative and other expenses certain structured products may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the funds illiquidity to the extent that the fund at a particular point in time may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities structured products are generally privately offered and sold and thus are not registered under the securities laws certain structured products may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the funds illiquidity to the extent that the fund at a particular point in time may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities in addition to the general risks associated with fixed income securities discussed herein structured products carry additional risks including but not limited to the possibility that distributions from underlying investments will not be adequate to make interest or other payments the quality of the underlying investments may decline in value or default the possibility that the security may be subordinate to other classes and the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results investments in structured notes involve risks including interest rate risk credit risk and market risk when the funds investments in structured notes are based upon the movement of one or more factors depending on the factor used and the use of multipliers or deflators changes in interest rates and movement of the factor may cause significant price fluctuations additionally changes in the reference instrument or security may cause the interest rate on the structured note to be reduced to zero and any further changes in the reference instrument may then reduce the principal amount payable on maturity warrants risk the fund may invest in warrants while the market value of a warrant tends to be more volatile than that of the securities underlying the warrant the market value of a warrant may not necessarily change with that of the underlying security a warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to any expiration date to which the warrant is subject the purchase of warrants involves a risk that the fund could lose the purchase value of a warrant if the right to subscribe to additional shares is not exercised prior to the warrants expiration also the purchase of warrants involves the risk that the effective price paid for the warrant added to the subscription price of the related security may exceed the value of the subscribed securitys market price such as when there is no movement in the level of the underlying security inflationdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from the funds investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates as inflation increases the real value of the funds portfolio could decline deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the funds portfolio and common shares back to the top liquidity risk certain of the funds investments may be illiquid ie securities that cannot be disposed of within seven days in the ordinary course of business at approximately the value at which the fund has valued the securities illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value also the fund may not be able to dispose readily of illiquid securities when that would be beneficial at a favorable time or price or at prices approximating those at which the fund then values them further the lack of an established secondary market for illiquid securities may make it more difficult to value such securities which may negatively affect the price the fund would receive upon disposition of such securities see valuation risk valuation risk when market quotations are not readily available or are deemed to be unreliable the fund values its investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the board see net asset value fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset as a result there can be no assurance that fair value pricing will result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or that fair value pricing will reflect actual market value and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security or other asset will be materially different from quoted or published prices from the prices used by others for the same security or other asset andor from the value that actually could be or is realized upon the sale of that security or other asset legal and regulatory risk legal tax and regulatory changes could occur and may adversely affect the fund and its ability to pursue its investment strategies andor increase the costs of implementing such strategies new or revised laws or regulations may be imposed by the cftc the sec the us federal reserve or other banking regulators other governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets that could adversely affect the fund in particular these agencies are empowered to promulgate a variety of new rules pursuant to recently enacted financial reform legislation in the united states the fund also may be adversely affected by changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing statutes and rules by these governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations market disruption and geopolitical risk the wars with iraq and afghanistan and similar conflicts and geopolitical developments their aftermath and substantial military presence in afghanistan are likely to have a substantial effect on the us and world economies and securities markets the nature scope and duration of the wars and the potential costs of rebuilding infrastructure cannot be predicted with any certainty terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september   closed some of the us securities markets for a fourday period and similar future events cannot be ruled out the war and occupation terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led and may in the future lead to increased shortterm market volatility and may have adverse longterm effects on us and world economies and markets generally likewise natural and environmental disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan in early  and systemic market dislocations of the kind surrounding the insolvency of lehman brothers in  if repeated could be highly disruptive to economies and markets those events as well as other changes in foreign and domestic economic and political conditions also could have an acute effect on individual issuers or related groups of issuers these risks also could adversely affect individual issuers and securities markets interest rates secondary trading ratings credit risk inflation deflation and other factors relating to the funds investments and the market value and net asset value of the funds common shares portfolio turnover risk the techniques and strategies contemplated by the fund might result in a high degree of portfolio turnover the fund cannot accurately predict its securities portfolio turnover rate but anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will not exceed  under normal market conditions although it could be materially higher under certain conditions higher portfolio turnover rates result in corresponding increases in brokerage commissions and other trading costs and generate shortterm capital gains taxable as ordinary income antitakeover provisions the funds declaration of trust the declaration of trust includes provisions that could have the effect of inhibiting the funds possible conversion to openend status and limiting the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or the board in certain circumstances these provisions might also inhibit the ability of common shareholders to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices see antitakeover provisions in the declaration of trust back to the top  disclosure stone
