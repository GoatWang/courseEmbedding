end of the second business day after it is received by aul at its home office if it is preceded or accompanied by a completed application that contains all the information necessary for issuing the

necessary information is not provided to aul within five business days after the business day on which aul first receives an initial premium or if aul determines it cannot otherwise issue a contract aul will return the initial premium to the applicant unless consent is received to retain the initial premium until the application is made complete subsequent premiums other than initial premiums are credited as of the end of the valuation period in which they are received by aul at its home office free look period the owner has the right to return the contract for any reason within the free look period which is a ten day period beginning when the owner receives the contract if a particular state requires a longer free look period then eligible owners in that state will be allowed the longer statutory period in which to return the contract the returned contract will be deemed void and aul will refund the greater of  premium payments and  any contract value as of the end of the valuation period in which aul receives the contract plus any amounts deducted for premium taxes allocation of premiums initial premiums will be allocated among the investment accounts of the variable account or to the fixed account as instructed by the contract owner allocation to the investment accounts and the fixed account must be made in increments of  or   a contract owner may change the allocation instructions at any time by giving proper notice of the change to aul at its home office and such allocation will continue in effect until subsequently changed any such change in allocation instructions will be effective upon receipt of the change in allocation instructions by aul at its home office changes in the allocation of future premiums have no effect on premiums already paid such amounts however may be transferred among the investment accounts of the variable account or the fixed account in the manner described in transfers of account value transfers of account value all or part of an owners contract value may be transferred among the investment accounts of the variable account or to the fixed account at any time during the accumulation period upon receipt of a proper written request by aul at its home office the minimum amount that may be transferred from any one investment account is  or if less than  the owners remaining contract value in the investment account provided however that amounts transferred from the fixed account to an investment account during any given contract year cannot exceed  of the owners fixed account value as of the beginning of that contract year if after any transfer the owners remaining contract value in an investment account or in the fixed account would be less than  then such request will be treated as a request for a transfer of the entire contract value currently there are no limitations on the number of transfers between investment accounts available under a contract or the fixed account in addition no charges are currently imposed upon transfers aul reserves the right however at a future date to change the limitation on the minimum transfer to assess transfer charges to change the limit on remaining balances to limit the number and frequency of transfers and to suspend any transfer privileges if we determine that the transfers made by or on behalf of one or more owners are to the disadvantage of other owners we may restrict the rights of certain owners we also reserve the right to limit the size of transfers and remaining balances to limit the number and frequency of transfers and to discontinue telephone interactive voice response or internet based transfers any transfer from an investment account of the variable account shall be effected as of the end of the valuation date in which aul receives the request in proper form aul has established procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone or via the internet are genuine which include the use of personal identification numbers and recorded telephone calls neither aul nor its agents will be liable for acting upon instructions believed by aul or its agents to be genuine provided aul has complied with its procedures part of a contract owners fixed account value may be transferred to one or more investment accounts of the variable account during the accumulation period subject to certain limitations as described in the fixed account dollar cost averaging program owners who wish to purchase units of an investment account over a period of time may do so through the dollar cost averaging dca program the theory of dollar cost averaging is that greater numbers of accumulation units are purchased at times when the unit prices are relatively low  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th than are purchased when the prices are higher this has the effect when purchases are made at different prices of reducing the aggregate average cost per accumulation unit to less than the average of the accumulation unit prices on the same purchase dates however participation in the dollar cost averaging program does not assure a contract owner of greater profits from the purchases under the program nor will it prevent or necessarily alleviate losses in a declining market for example assume that a contract owner requests that  per month be transferred from the money market investment account to the aul american equity investment account the following table illustrates the effect of dollar cost averaging over a six month period download table transfer unit units month amount value purchased                             the average price per unit for these purchases is the sum of the prices  divided by the number of monthly transfers  or  the average cost per accumulation unit for these purchases is the total amount transferred  divided by the total number of accumulation units purchased  or  this table is for illustrative purposes only and is not representative of future results under a dca program the owner deposits premiums into the aul american money market investment account and then authorizes aul to transfer a specific dollar amount from the money market investment account into one or more other investment accounts at the unit values determined on the dates of the transfers this may be done monthly quarterly semiannually or annually these transfers will continue automatically until aul receives notice to discontinue the program or until there is not enough money in the money market investment account to continue the program whichever occurs first currently the minimum required amount of each transfer is  although aul reserves the right to change this minimum transfer amount in the future transfers to or from the fixed account are not permitted under the dollar cost averaging program at least ten days advance written notice to aul is required before the date of the first proposed transfer under the dca program aul offers the dollar cost averaging program to contract owners at no charge and the company reserves the right to temporarily discontinue terminate or change the program at any time contract owners may change the frequency of scheduled transfers or may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled transfers or may discontinue participation in the program at any time by providing written notice to aul provided that aul must receive written notice of such a change at least five days before a previously scheduled transfer is to occur contract owners may initially elect to participate in the dca program and if this election is made at the time the contract is applied for the program will take effect on the first monthly quarterly semiannual or annual transfer date following the premium receipt by aul at its home office the contract owner may select the particular date of the month quarter or year that the transfers are to be made and such transfers will automatically be performed on such date provided that such date selected is a day that aul is open for business and provided further that such date is a valuation date if the date selected is not a business day or is not a valuation date then the transfer will be made on the next succeeding valuation date to participate in the program a minimum deposit of  is required contract owners variable account value accumulation units premiums allocated to the investment accounts available under a contract are credited to the contract in the form of accumulation units the number of accumulation units to be credited is determined by dividing the dollar amount allocated to the particular investment account by the accumulation unit value for the particular investment account as of the end of the valuation period in which the premium is credited the number of accumulation units so credited to the contract shall not be changed by a subsequent change in the value of an accumulation unit but the dollar value of an accumulation unit may vary from valuation date to valuation date depending upon the investment experience of the investment account and charges against the investment account accumulation unit value aul determines the accumulation unit value for each investment account of the variable account on each valuation date the accumulation unit value for each investment account was initially set at one dollar  for the money market investment account and  for all other investment accounts subsequently on each valuation date the accumulation unit value for each investment account is determined by multiplying the net investment factor determined as of the end of the valuation date for the particular investment account by the accumulation unit value for the investment account as of the immediately preceding valuation period the accumulation unit value for each investment account may increase decrease or remain the same from valuation period to valuation period in accordance with the net investment factor net investment factor the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of an investment account from one valuation period to the next for any investment account for a valuation period the net

a proper written request in a form acceptable to aul is received by aul at its home office a full surrender of a contract will result in a withdrawal payment equal to the owners contract value allocated to the variable account as of the end of the valuation period during which a proper withdrawal request is received by aul at its home office minus any applicable withdrawal charge a partial withdrawal may be requested for a specified percentage or dollar amount of an owners contract value a request for a partial withdrawal will result in a payment by aul equal to the amount specified in the partial withdrawal request upon payment the owners contract value will be reduced by an amount equal to the payment and any applicable withdrawal charge requests for a partial withdrawal that would leave a contract value of less than  for a nonqualified one year flexible premium contract  for a qualified contract and less than the required cumulative minimum for a flexible premium contract will be treated as a request for a full surrender aul may change or waive this provision at its discretion the minimum amount that may be withdrawn from a contract owners contract value is  for flexible premium contracts and  for one year flexible premium contracts if the remaining contract value is less than these amounts a request for a withdrawal will be treated as a surrender of the contract in addition the contracts may be issued in connection with certain retirement programs that are subject to constraints on withdrawals and full surrenders the amount of a partial withdrawal will be taken from the investment accounts and the fixed account as instructed and if the owner does not specify in proportion to the owners contract value in the various investment accounts and the fixed account a partial withdrawal will not be effected until proper instructions are received by aul at its home office a surrender or a partial withdrawal may result in the deduction of a withdrawal charge and may be subject to a premium tax charge for any tax on premiums that may be imposed by various states and municipalities see premium tax charge a surrender or withdrawal that results in receipt of proceeds by a contract owner may result in receipt of taxable income to the contract owner and in some instances a tax penalty in addition distributions under certain qualified plans may

beneficiary designation contained in an application for the contracts will remain in effect until changed the interests of a beneficiary who dies before the contract owner will pass to any surviving beneficiary unless the contract owner specifies otherwise unless otherwise provided if no designated beneficiary is living upon the death of the contract owner prior to the annuity date the contract owners estate is the beneficiary unless otherwise provided if no designated beneficiary under an annuity option is living after the annuity date upon the death of the annuitant the owner is the beneficiary if the contract owner is not an individual the contract owner will be the beneficiary subject to the rights of an irrevocably designated beneficiary the designation of a beneficiary may be changed or revoked at any time while the contract owner is living by filing with aul a written beneficiary designation or revocation in such form as aul may require the change or revocation will not be binding upon aul until it is received by aul at its home office when it is so received the change or revocation will be effective as of the date on which the beneficiary designation or revocation was signed but the change or revocation will be without prejudice to aul if any payment has been made or any action has been taken by aul prior to receiving the change or revocation for contracts issued in connection with qualified plans reference should be made to the terms of the particular qualified plan if any and any applicable law for any restrictions on the beneficiary designation for instance under an employee benefit plan the beneficiary or contingent annuitant must be the contract owners spouse if the contract owner is married unless the spouse properly consents to the designation of a beneficiary or contingent annuitant other than the spouse assignability a contract owner may assign a contract but the rights of the contract owner and any beneficiary will be secondary to the interests of the assignee aul assumes no responsibility for the validity of an assignment any assignment will not be binding upon aul until received in writing at its home office because an assignment may be a taxable event contract owners should consult a tax advisor as to the tax consequences resulting from such an assignment however under certain qualified plans no benefit or privilege under a contract may be sold assigned discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to any person or entity other than aul proof of age and survival aul may require proof of age sex or survival of any person on whose life annuity payments depend misstatements if the age or sex of an annuitant or contingent annuitant has been misstated the correct amount paid or payable by aul shall be such as the contract would have provided for the correct age and sex acceptance of new premiums aul reserves the right to refuse to accept new premiums for a contract at any time federal tax matters introduction the contracts described in this prospectus are designed for use in connection with nontax qualified retirement plans for individuals and for use by individuals in connection with retirement plans under the provisions of sections  b   or a of the internal revenue code code the ultimate effect of federal income taxes on values under a contract on annuity payments and on the economic benefits to the owner the annuitant and the beneficiary or other payee may depend upon the type of qualified plan for which the contract is purchased and a number of different factors the discussion contained herein and in the statement of additional information is general in nature it is based upon auls understanding of the present federal income tax laws as currently interpreted by the internal revenue service irs and is not intended as tax advice no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of the present federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the irs future legislation may affect annuity contracts adversely moreover no attempt is made to consider any applicable state or other laws because of the inherent complexity of such laws and the fact that tax results will vary according to the terms of the qualified plan and the particular circumstances of the individual involved any person contemplating the purchase of a contract or receiving annuity payments under a contract should consult a qualified tax adviser aul does not make any guarantee regarding the tax status of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts consult your tax advisor diversification standards treasury department regulations under section h of the code prescribe asset diversification requirements which are expected to be met by the investment companies whose shares are sold to the investment accounts failure to meet these requirements would jeopardize the tax status of the contracts see the statement of additional information for additional details in connection with the issuance of the regulations governing diversification under section h of the code the treasury department announced that it would issue future regulations or rulings addressing the circumstances in which a variable contract owners control of the investments of  pbposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st a separate account may cause the contract owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the separate account if the variable contract owner is considered the owner of the securities underlying the separate account income and gains produced by those securities would be included currently in a contract owners gross income it is not clear at present what these regulations or rulings may provide it is possible that when the regulations or rulings are issued the contracts may need to be modified in order to remain in compliance aul intends to make reasonable efforts to comply with any such regulations or rulings so that the contracts will be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes and reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose taxation of annuities in general  nonqualified plans section  of the code governs taxation of annuities in general a contract owner is not taxed on increases in value under an annuity contract until some form of distribution is made under the contract however the increase in value may be subject to tax currently under certain circumstances see contracts owned by nonnatural persons below and diversification standards above  surrenders or withdrawals prior to the annuity date code section  provides that amounts received upon a total or partial surrender or withdrawal from a contract prior to the annuity date generally will be treated as gross income to the extent that the cash value of the contract determined without regard to any surrender charge in the case of a partial withdrawal exceeds the investment in the contract in general the investment in the contract is that portion if any of premiums paid under a contract less any distributions received previously under the contract that are excluded from the recipients gross income the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for purposes of this rule a pledge or assignment of a contract is treated as a payment received on account of a partial withdrawal of a contract similarly loans under a contract generally are treated as distributions under the contract  surrenders or withdrawals on or after the annuity date upon receipt of a lumpsum payment the recipient is taxed if the cash value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract  amounts received as an annuity for amounts received as an annuity the taxable portion of each payment is determined by using a formula known as the exclusion ratio which establishes the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount of annuity payments for the term of the contract that ratio is then applied to each payment to determine the nontaxable portion of the payment that remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income rates once the excludible portion of annuity payments to date equals the investment in the contract the balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable withholding of federal income taxes on all distributions may be required unless a recipient who is eligible elects not to have any amounts withheld and properly notifies aul of that election special rules apply to withholding on distributions from employee benefit plans that are qualified under section a of the internal revenue code  penalty tax on certain surrenders and withdrawals with respect to amounts withdrawn or distributed before the recipient reaches age   a penalty tax is imposed equal to  of the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income however the penalty tax is not applicable to withdrawals  made on or after the death of the owner or where the owner is not an individual the death of the primary annuitant who is defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary importance in affecting the timing and amount of the payout under the contract  attributable to the recipients becoming totally disabled within the meaning of code section m or  which are part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the recipient or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the recipient and his beneficiary the  penalty also does not apply in certain other circumstances described in code section  if the penalty tax does not apply to a surrender or withdrawal as a result of the application of item  above and the series of payments are subsequently modified other than by reason of death or disability the tax for the first year in which the modification occurs will be increased by an amount determined in accordance with irs regulations equal to the tax that would have been imposed but for item  above plus interest for the deferral period if the modification takes place a before the close of the period which is five years from the date of the first payment and after the recipient attains age   or b before the recipient reaches age   additional considerations  distributionatdeath rules in order to be treated as an annuity contract a contract must provide the following two distribution rules a if the owner dies on or after the annuity commencement date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining interest must be distributed at least as quickly as the method in effect on the owners death and b if the owner dies before the annuity date the entire interest in the contract must generally be distributed within five years after the date of death or if payable to a designated beneficiary must be annuitized over the life of that designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary commencing within one year after the date of death of the owner if the designated beneficiary is the spouse of the owner the contract may be continued in the name of the spouse as owner for purposes of determining the timing of distributions under the foregoing rules where the owner is not an  pbposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd individual the primary annuitant is considered the owner in that case a change in the primary annuitant will be treated as the death of the owner finally in the case of joint owners the distributionatdeath rules will be applied by treating the death of the first owner as the one to be taken into account in determining how generally distributions must commence unless the sole surviving owner is the deceased owners spouse  gift of annuity contracts generally gifts of contracts not purchased in connection with a qualified plan before the annuity commencement date will trigger income tax on the gain on the contract with the donee getting a steppedup basis for the amount included in the donors income this provision does not apply to certain transfers incident to a divorce the  penalty tax on preage   withdrawals and distributions and gift tax also may be applicable  contracts owned by nonnatural persons if the contract is held by a nonnatural person for example a corporation in connection with its nontax qualified deferred compensation plan the income on that contract generally the net surrender value less the premium payments is includible in taxable income each year other taxes such as the alternative minimum tax and the environmental tax imposed under code section a may also apply the rule does not apply where the contract is acquired by the estate of a decedent where the contract is held by certain types of retirement plans where the contract is a qualified funding asset for structured settlements where the contract is purchased on behalf of an employee upon termination of an employee benefit plan and in the case of a socalled immediate annuity code section  deferred compensation plans for employees of state and local governments and taxexempt organizations are not within the purview of the exceptions however the income of state and local governments and taxexempt organizations generally is exempt from federal income tax  multiple contract rule for purposes of determining the amount of any distribution under code section e amounts not received as annuities that is includable in gross income all annuity contracts issued by the same insurer to the same contract owner during any calendar year must be aggregated and treated as one contract thus any amount received under any such contract prior to the contracts annuity commencement date such as a partial surrender dividend or loan will be taxable and possibly subject to the  penalty tax to the extent of the combined income in all such contracts in addition the treasury department has broad regulatory authority in applying this provision to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this new rule qualified plans the contract may be used with certain types of qualified plans as described under the contracts the tax rules applicable to participants in such qualified plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan itself no attempt is made herein to provide more than general information about the use of the contract with the various types of qualified plans contract owners annuitants and beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits under such qualified plans will be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves and may be limited by applicable law regardless of the terms and conditions of the contract issued in connection therewith for example aul may accept beneficiary designations and payment instructions under the terms of the contract without regard to any spousal consents that may be required under the code or the employee retirement income securities act of  erisa consequently a contract owners beneficiary designation or elected payment option may not be enforceable the following are brief descriptions of the various types of

the end of the valuation date that the termination is effective minus any applicable investment liquidation charge the investment liquidation charge applies only to participants fixed account values under these contracts the charge is equal to a certain percentage as described below multiplied by the withdrawal value derived from the fixed account of each participant under a contract the percentage is determined by the following formula x  y where x is the current rate of interest as described under interest being credited by aul to new contributions allocated to the fixed account as of the effective date of termination and y is the average rate of interest being credited by aul to various portions of a participants fixed account value as of the effective date of termination

and termination by the owner charges and deductions premium tax charge various states and municipalities impose a tax on premiums received by insurance companies whether or not a premium tax is imposed will depend upon among other things the owners state of residence the annuitants state of residence and the insurance tax laws and auls status in a particular state aul assesses a premium tax charge to reimburse itself for premium taxes that it incurs this charge will be deducted as premium taxes are incurred by aul which is usually when an annuity is effected premium tax rates currently range from  to  but are subject to change by such governmental entities withdrawal charge no deduction for sales charges is made from contributions for a contract however if a cash withdrawal is made a participants account is surrendered or the contract is terminated by the owner then depending on the type of contract a withdrawal charge which may also be referred to as a contingent deferred sales charge may be assessed by aul if the participants account has not been in existence for a certain period of time for the first two contract years that a participants account exists the amount withdrawn during a contract year that will not be subject to a withdrawal charge is  of  the total of all contributions made during the year that the withdrawal is being made plus  the participants account value at the beginning of the contract year after the first two contract years and until the withdrawal charge has decreased to  the amount withdrawn during a contract year that will not be subject to an otherwise applicable withdrawal charge is  of the participants account value at the beginning of the contract year in which the withdrawal is being made if a participants contributions were initially allocated to a recurring contribution contract and then transferred to a single contribution contract pursuant to a transfer agreement between aul and the participant when the required minimum of  was reached then for purposes of establishing the number of account years that an account has been in existence credit will be given for the time that the contributions were in the recurring contribution contract the chart below illustrates the amount of the withdrawal charge that applies to the different types of contracts based on the number of years that the account has been in existence charge on withdrawal exceeding  allowable amount account year            or more recurring contribution contracts            single contribution contracts            withdrawal charges are not imposed for many benefits provided under benefit responsive contracts a benefit responsive contract can be distinguished from a contract that is not benefit responsive by the contractual condition that under a benefit responsive contract withdrawal charges are not imposed for payment of retirement death disability termination of employment hardship loan age  required minimum distribution benefits or benefits upon attainment of age  provided that the age  benefit is a taxable distribution paid to the participant and not to any other person or entity including any alternative or substitute fund medium under certain circumstances withdrawal charges are not imposed under modified benefit responsive contracts a modified benefit responsive contract can be distinguished from a contract that is not modified benefit responsive by the contractual condition that under a modified benefit responsive contract withdrawal charges are not imposed for cash lumpsum payments of death benefits or provided the participant has  attained age  and has  years of service with the employer identified in the plan or  attained age  for plan benefits due to retirement disability termination of employment hardships loans or required minimum distribution benefits pursuant to internal revenue code section a and regulations issued thereunder or for benefits upon attainment of age  provided that such benefit upon attainment of age  is a taxable distribution paid to the participant and not to any other person or entity including any substitute funding medium in no event will the amount of any withdrawal charge when added to any withdrawal charges previously assessed against any amount withdrawn from a participants account exceed  of the contributions made by or on behalf of a participant under a contract in addition no withdrawal charge will be imposed on or after the annuity commencement date or upon payment of a death benefit under the contract the withdrawal charge will be used to recover certain expenses relating to sales of the contracts including commissions paid to sales personnel and other promotional costs aul reserves the right to increase the withdrawal charge for any participant accounts established on or after the effective date of the change but the withdrawal charge will not exceed  of the contributions made by or on behalf of a participant mortality and expense risk charge aul deducts a daily charge from the assets of each investment account for mortality and expense risks assumed by aul the charge is equal to an annual rate of  of the average daily net assets of each investment account this amount is intended to compensate aul for certain mortality and expense risks aul assumes in offering and administering the contracts and in operating the variable account the  charge was originally based on estimates of  for expense risk and  for mortality risk the expense risk is the risk that auls actual expenses in issuing and administering the contracts and operating the variable account will be more than the charges assessed for such expenses the mortality risk borne by aul is the risk that annuitants as a group will live longer than the companys actuarial tables predict aul may ultimately realize a profit from this charge to the extent it is not needed to address mortality and administrative expenses but aul may realize a loss to the extent the charge is not sufficient aul may use any profit derived from this charge for any lawful purpose including any distribution expenses not covered by the withdrawal charge administrative charge under recurring contribution contracts aul deducts an administrative charge from each participants account equal to the lesser of  of the participants account value or  a quarter the charge is assessed every quarter on a participant account if it is in effect on the quarterly contract anniversary and is assessed only during the accumulation period when a participant annuitizes or surrenders on any day other than a quarterly contract anniversary a pro rata portion of the charge for that portion of the quarter will not be assessed the charge is deducted proportionately from the participants account value allocated among the investment accounts and the fixed account the purpose of this charge is to reimburse aul for the expenses associated with administration of the contracts and operation of the variable account the administrative charge may at the employers option be billed directly to and paid directly by the employer in lieu of being deducted from a participants account under employer sponsored b contracts or under combined contracts containing an employee benefit plan and employer sponsored b contributions or the charge may be paid on any other basis mutually agreed upon by the employer and aul aul does not expect to profit from this charge there is no administrative charge deducted from participants accounts that are allocated to single contribution contracts other charges aul may charge the investment accounts of the variable account for the federal state or local income taxes incurred by aul that are attributable to the variable account and its investment accounts no such charge is currently assessed an investment liquidation charge which applies only to participants fixed account values under a contract may be imposed upon termination by an owner of a contract acquired in connection with an employee benefit plan or  program see termination by the owner variations in charges aul may reduce or waive the amount of the withdrawal charge and administrative charge for a contract where the expenses associated with the sale of the contract or the administrative costs associated with the contract are reduced for example the withdrawal andor administrative charge may be reduced in connection with acquisition of the contract in exchange for another annuity contract issued by aul aul may also reduce or waive the withdrawal charge and administrative charge on contracts sold to the directors or employees of aul or any of its affiliates or to directors or any employees of any of the funds guarantee of certain charges aul guarantees that the mortality and expense risk charge shall not increase aul also guarantees that through the year  the administrative charge may not increase to moreel than  per quarter after the year  aul may increase the fee but only to the extent necessary to recover the expenses associated with administration of the contracts and operation of the variable account expenses of the funds each investment account of the variable account purchases shares at the net asset value of the corresponding portfolio of one of the funds the net asset value reflects

transferred contribution was originally deposited into the recurring contribution contract if aul changes the current rate such amounts contributed or transferred on or after the effective date of the change earn interest at the new current rate however amounts contributed or transferred prior to the effective date of the change may earn interest at the prior current rate or other current rate

beneficiary designation or revocation in such form as aul may require the change or revocation will not be binding upon aul until it is received by aul at its home office when it is so received the change or revocation will be effective as of the date on which the beneficiary designation or revocation was signed but the change or revocation will be without prejudice to aul if any payment has been made or any action has been taken by aul prior to receiving the change or revocation reference should be made to the terms of the particular plan and any applicable law for any restrictions on

entity and its operations form a part of aul aul will be responsible for any federal income taxes that become payable with respect to the income of the variable account however each investment account will bear its allocable share of such liabilities under current law no item of dividend income interest income or realized capital gain attributable at a minimum to appreciation of the investment accounts will be taxed to aul to the extent it is applied to increase reserves under the contracts the funds in which the variable account will invest its assets are each intended to qualify as a

person to any benefits under these programs may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of the terms and conditions of the contracts issued in connection therewith generally no taxes are imposed on the increases in the value of a contract by reason of investment experience or employer contributions until a distribution occurs either as a lumpsum payment or annuity payments under an elected annuity option or in the form of cash withdrawals surrenders or other distributions prior to the annuity commencement date the amounts that may be contributed to the plans are subject to limitations that may vary depending on the type of plan in addition early distributions from most plans may be subject to penalty taxes or in the case of distributions of amounts contributed under salary reduction agreements could cause the plan to be disqualified furthermore distributions from most plans are subject to certain minimum distribution rules failure to comply with these rules could result in disqualification of the plan or subject the annuitant to penalty taxes as a result the minimum distribution rules could limit the availability of certain annuity options to participants and their beneficiaries below are brief descriptions of various types of retirement programs and the use of the contracts in connection therewith employee benefit plans code section  permits business employers and certain associations to establish various types of retirement plans for employees such retirement plans may permit the purchase of contracts to provide benefits thereunder if a participant under an employee benefit plan receives a lumpsum distribution the portion of the distribution equal to any contribution that was taxable to the participant in the year when paid is generally received tax free the balance of the distribution will generally be treated as ordinary income special fiveyear forward averaging provisions under code section  may be utilized on any amount subject to ordinary income tax treatment provided that the participant has reached age  has not previously elected forward averaging for a distribution from any employee benefit plan after reaching age  and has not rolled over a partial distribution from a similar plan into an individual retirement account or annuity special tenyear averaging and a capitalgains election may be available to a participant who reached age  before  under an employee benefit plan under section  of the code when annuity payments commence as opposed to a lumpsum distribution under section  of the code the portion of each payment attributable to contributions that were taxable to the participant in the year made if any is excluded from gross income as a return of the participants investment the portion so excluded is determined at the time the payments commence by dividing the participants investment in the contract by the expected return the periodic payments in excess of this amount are taxable as ordinary income once the participants investment has been recovered the full annuity payment will be taxable if the annuity should stop before the investment has been received the unrecovered portion is deductible on the annuitants final return if the participant made no contributions that were taxable to the participant in the year made there would be no portion excludable b programs code section b permits public school systems and certain types of charitable educational and scientific organizations specified in code section c to purchase annuity contracts on behalf of their employees and subject to certain limitations allows employees of those organizations to exclude the amount of contributions from gross income for federal income tax purposes if a participant under a b program makes a surrender or partial withdrawal from the participants account the participant generally will realize income taxable at ordinary tax rates on the full amount received see constraints on withdrawal  b programs since under a b program contributions generally are excludable from the taxable income of the employee the full amount received will usually be taxable as ordinary income when annuity payments com mence  programs code sections  and  permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program including simplified employee pension plans

received since under a  program contributions generally are excludable from the taxable income of the employee the full amount received will usually be taxable as ordinary income when annuity payments commence  programs section  of the code permits employees of state and local governments and units and agencies of state and local governments as well as taxexempt organizations described in section c of the code to defer a portion of their compensation without paying current taxes the employees must be participants in an eligible deferred compensation plan although a participant under a  program may direct or choose methods of investment all amounts deferred under the program and any income thereon remain solely the property of the employer and subject to the claims of its general creditors until paid or made available to the participant or beneficiary under the program if the employer sponsoring a  program requests and receives a withdrawal for an eligible employee in connection with a  program then the amount received by the employee will be taxed as ordinary income since under a  program contributions are excludable from the taxable income of the employee the full amount received will usually be taxable as ordinary income when annuity payments commence or other distribution is made tax penalty any distribution made to a participant from an employee benefit plan or a  program other than on account of one or more of the following events will be subject to a  penalty tax on the amount distributed a the participant has attained age  b the participant has died or c the participant is disabled in addition a distribution from an employee benefit plan will not be subject to a  excise tax on the amount distributed if the participant is  and has separated from service

is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order in the form of a lumpsum settlement or periodic annuity payments for a fixed period of fewer than  years are subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding of  of the taxable amount of the distribution unless the distributee directs the transfer of such amounts to another employee benefit plan or b program or to an individual retirement account under code section  the taxable amount is the amount of the distribution less the amount allocable to aftertax contributions all other types of distributions from employee benefit plans and b programs and all distributions from individual retirement accounts are subject to federal income tax withholding on the taxable amount unless the distributee elects not to have the withholding apply the amount withheld is based on the type of distribution federal tax will be withheld from annuity payments other than those subject to mandatory  withholding pursuant to the recipients withholding certificate if no withholding certificate is filed with aul tax will be withheld on the basis that the payee is married with three withholding exemptions tax on all surrenders and lumpsum distributions from individual retirement accounts will be withheld at a flat  rate withholding on annuity payments and other distributions from the contract will be made in accordance with regulations of the internal revenue service in general participants in retirement plans that own annuity contracts are not taxed on increases in the value of their accounts until some form of distribution is made to the participant due to this tax deferral during the accumulation period participation in a retirement plan funded by an annuity contract generally results in more rapid growth than a comparable investment under which contributions and increases in value are taxed on a current basis the chart illustrates this benefit by comparing a retirement plan that invests in a variable annuity contract to accumulation from an investment whose contributions and gains are taxed on a current basis the chart illustrates accumulation of  of monthly beforetax contributions going into an annuity contract for a retirement plan and  of monthly aftertax contributions going into a conventional savings plan  minus  of income taxes based on an assumed combined rate of  for state and federal income tax equals  of aftertax contributions each contribution is made at the end of each month this chart also assumes a  beforetax earnings rate values for tax deferred accumulation after tax and pre tax accumulation value reflect the deduction for mortality and expense risk charges under a variable annuity contract and values shown for tax deferred accumulation after tax reflect appropriate withdrawal charges at the end of the periods shown the hypothetical rate of return used in the chart is an assumption only and no implication is intended that the return is guaranteed in any way or that it represents an average or expected rate of return over the period depicted the portion of a participants account value that exceeds the variable annuity contract owners or participants investment in the participants account is taxed at ordinary income tax rates upon distribution and a  tax penalty may apply to withdrawals taken before the taxpayer reaches the age of

the table below indicates the investment objectives and primary risks of the two portfolios are the same and the investment strategies are substantially similar further the expense ratio of the vvif is lower than the expense ratio of vef and the one five and ten year performance of the vvif for the period ended december   is better than that of the vef over the same period while vef has seven investment advisers and vvif has two vvifs advisers are both advisers of vef  applicants submit that the foregoing demonstrates that no material difference exists between the removed portfolio and the substituted portfolio both invest in small company stocks using a growth strategy and share the same primary risks accordingly applicants believe that the contract owners have a reasonable continuity

the proposed substitution will strengthen the fund offerings within the contracts fund lineup applicants expect the proposed substitution to provide benefits to the contract owners including a better performing lower cost portfolio the application states that vanguard has been consulted about the proposed substitution and has no objection to it  moreover applicants state that after the proposed substitution contract owners will continue to be able to select among portfolios with a full range of investment objectives investments strategies and risks  in sum the applicants also have concluded that the substituted portfolio is better suited than the removed portfolio to serve as the underlying portfolio for the aul account as an operational and procedural matter the substituted portfolio is designed to serve as an investment vehicle for insurance company separate accounts  in comparing expense ratios the application states that as set forth in the prospectuses of the substituted portfolio and removed portfolio the substituted portfolio has a lower total expense ratio  than the removed portfolio  neither the substituted portfolio nor the removed portfolio pays fees pursuant to rule b of the act  the chart below as included in the application provides a comparison of expenses  management expenses in percentb distribution feeother expenses in percenttotal annual operating expenses in percentremoved portfolio investor sharesnonesubstituted portfolionone  in addition to expenses applicants state in the application that relative performance is a reason for the substitution according to vanguard the substituted portfolio has outperformed the removed portfolio over the last one five and ten year periods for the period ended december   in these time periods respectively the substituted portfolio has returned   and  while the removed portfolio has returned   and  each before taxes  the proposed substitution will take place at each portfolios relative net asset values determined on the date of the substitution in accordance with section  of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners cash value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts accordingly there will be no financial impact on any contract owner the substitution will be effected by having the subaccount that invests in the removed portfolio redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the substitution and purchase shares of the substituted portfolio at the net asset value calculated on the same date  the application notes that the substitution will be described in detail in a written notice mailed to contract owners the notice will inform contract owners of applicants intent to implement the substitution and describe the substitution the reasons for engaging in the proposed substitution and how the substitution will be implemented the notice will be mailed to all contract owners at least  days prior to the substitution and will inform affected contract owners that they may transfer assets from the subaccount investing in the removed portfolio at any time after receipt of the notice and from the subaccount investing in the substituted portfolio for  days after the substitution to any subaccounts investing in other portfolios available under their respective contracts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year a supplement will be filed with the commission for the current prospectus containing the information to be included in the notice  applicants state further that each contract owner will be provided a prospectus for the substituted portfolio within five business days after the substitution applicants will send each affected contract owner written confirmation that the substitution has occurred  the application also indicates that a applicants will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitution including all legal accounting and allocated brokerage expenses relating to the substitution b that no costs will be borne by the contract owners c that affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitution nor will their rights or the obligations of applicants under the contracts be altered in any way  applicants state that the proposed substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution the substitution will start printed page have no adverse tax consequences to contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act provides that it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission shall have approved such substitution and the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the  act section c protects the expectation of investors that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer and is intended to insure that unnecessary or burdensome sales loads additional reinvestment costs or other charges will not be incurred due to unapproved substitutions of securities  the proposed substitution of shares held by the aul account as described above may be deemed to involve a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act the applicants therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitution  the investment objective and primary risks of the substituted portfolio are the same as that of the removed portfolio and the investment strategies of the two are nearly identical thus contract owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations accordingly the substituted portfolio is an appropriate investment vehicle for those contract owners who have contract values allocated to the removed portfolio further the substituted portfolio has lower expenses and better historical performance than that of the removed portfolio  in connection with assets held under the contracts affected by the substitution applicants will not receive for three  years from the date of substitution any direct or indirect benefits from the substituted portfolio its advisors or underwriters or their affiliates at a rate higher than that which they had received from the removed portfolio its advisors or underwriters or their affiliates including but without limitation b shareholder service administration or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements  applicants represent and warrant that the substitution and the selection of the substituted portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to aul or its affiliates by the substituted portfolio its advisors or underwriters or their respective affiliates  the substitution will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was intended to guard against because the contract owner will continue to have the same type of investment choice with better potential returns and lower expenses and will not otherwise have any incentive to redeem their shares or terminate their contracts  the purposes terms and conditions of the proposed substitution are consistent with the protection of investors and the principles and purposes of section c and do not entail any of the abuses that section c is designed to prevent a the substituted portfolio has better historical performance than the removed portfolio b the current total annual operating expenses and management fee of the substituted portfolio are lower than those of the removed portfolio c the substituted portfolio is an appropriate portfolio to move contract owners values currently allocated to the removed portfolio because the portfolios have the same objectives and risks and very similar strategies d all costs of the substitution including any allocated brokerage costs will be borne by applicants and will not be borne by contract owners no charges will be assessed to effect the substitution e the substitution will be at the net asset value of the respective portfolio shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract values f the substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by the contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution and will result in contract owners contract values being moved to a portfolio with lower current total annual operating expenses g notice of the proposed substitution will be mailed to all contract owners at least  days prior to the substitution all contract owners will have an opportunity at any time after receipt of the notice of the substitution and for  days after the substitution to transfer contract account value affected by the substitution to other available subaccounts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without being counted as one of the contract owners free transfers in a contract year h within five business days after the substitution applicants will send to their affected contract owners a written confirmation that the substitution has occurred i the substitution will in no way alter the terms of the contracts or the obligations of applicants under them j the substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners conclusion applicants
