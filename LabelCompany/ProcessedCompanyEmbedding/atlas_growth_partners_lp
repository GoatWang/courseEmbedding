offering efforts primary offering suspension on november   management decided to temporarily suspend our current primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues cash distributions suspension on november   our board of directors determined to suspend our quarterly common unit distributions beginning with the three months ended september   in order retain our cash flow and reinvest in our business and assets due to the suspension of our current primary offering general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines since the fourth quarter of  through the third quarter of  the causes of these declines are based on a number of factors including but not limited to a significant increase in natural gas oil and ngl production while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the longterm in the areas in which we operate fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas oil and ngl reserves our future gas and oil reserves production cash flow our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders including atls depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently developing our existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically we face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas oil and ngl prices as initial reservoir pressures are depleted natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce to the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital our ability to drill and acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted results of operations gas and oil production production profile currently our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the eagle ford marble falls and mississippi lime plays we have established production positions in the following operating areas the eagle ford shale in southern texas an

number of variables including oil and natural gas prices prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of  although oil and natural gas prices increased slowly over the three months ended september   these lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues earnings and cash flows sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position on november   management decided to temporarily suspend our current primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues in addition our board of directors determined to suspend our quarterly common unit distributions beginning with the three months ended september   in order retain our cash flow and reinvest in our business and assets due to the suspension of our current primary offering accordingly these decisions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern management determined that substantial doubt is alleviated through managements plans to reduce general and
