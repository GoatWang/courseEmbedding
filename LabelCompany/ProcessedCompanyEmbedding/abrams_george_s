over black chalk   credit rebecca d abrams maida and george abrams this past june the fogg art museum at harvard received an extraordinary gift of  seventeenthcentury dutch drawings from the collection of george and maida abrams the news attracted international attention — the abramses own the finest private collection in this field and one of the foremost in the world which they have assiduously built and refined since the s thanks to the abramses the fogg now houses the foremost collection of dutch drawings in the country enriching the museum’s mission of research professional training and programming in a manner that “has happened only a few times in our history” said james cuno director of the harvard university art museums the peerless gift offers a sweeping view of masterworks and rare drawings by dutch and flemish artists from the mids to  among them rembrandt pieter brueghel the elder hendrick goltzius adriaen van ostade jacques de gheyn ii cornelis vroom jacob van ruisdael and many others the gift also chronicles the major styles and genres of this remarkably prolific period “maida and i have always been committed to making our collection available to scholars and students by welcoming them into our home and lending works to institutions across the united states and europe” george abrams said in announcing their gift “we want to continue to encourage future generations of scholars and through them spark the interest of the public in appreciating dutch drawings and art we can think of no better way to continue the tradition of sharing these magical works than to give them a permanent home at the fogg art museum” the abramses are internationally known collectors respected for their wisdom vision and tenacity george abrams ’ is also a harvardtrained lawyer who has built an independent highpowered practice the inspiration for abrams’ double life in art and law hearkens back to his early hls days during his first year at the school abrams made an unusual choice rather than spend his summers working at a law firm the traditional route for ls and ls abrams took a job planning cultural activities for students abroad for a dutch organization that ran exchange programs “so instead of doing what i was supposed to do learning more about the law i spent my summers in holland where i devoted as much time as i could to visiting museums i grew to love the art of that country” he says as a harvard college student abrams had taken some art history courses and as managing editor of the harvard crimson he regularly reported exhibition openings at the fogg art museum but it was during his holland summers that this general inclination toward the arts began to sharpen and focus all the while he diligently flourished in law school abrams was chafing at “the fulltime focus on the law to the exclusion of other interests” a member of the army reserve abrams went on active duty for six months after graduation which interrupted his “immersion in law” returning to civilian life he went into practice with his father samuel ’ and his sister ruth abrams ’ who would later become an assistant da assistant attorney general and the first woman to serve on the massachusetts supreme judicial court abrams found legal practice was after all to his liking yet he knew he wanted a life involved in the arts as much as a life in the law and he gained an ideal partner in that quest in  when he married maida stocker a philosophy and arts major at sarah lawrence college one of george abrams’ first law clients a boston art dealer named hyman swetzoff shared his interest in old master drawings with the young couple and encouraged them to begin their own collection the abramses admired the intimacy and humanity of the delicate works as george abrams later wrote “we loved holding drawings in our hands and looking carefully at those markings in pen and ink charcoal gouache and silverpoint to see and sometimes possess works by artists who lived and worked  or  years ago seemed like a miracle the finest drawings appeared to exist on two levels the one material the other spiritual a peculiar unity between the expression of something eternal and the fragile being of a small piece of paper” when they first started collecting the abramses lived on the bottom floor of a commonwealth avenue brownstone in boston and had limited financial resources drawings were a more affordable medium for the novice collectors as for choosing a specialty they settled easily on seventeenthcentury dutch drawings george was already an aficionado of dutch art and both were drawn to the naturalism and immediacy of drawings from this period the twelve years’ truce of  ushered in a tranquil prosperous era during which dutch artists turned away from traditional religious subjects to find their inspiration in the richness of ordinary life they produced a cornucopia of imagery views of wooded landscapes and calm seas gypsy subjects scenes of “low life” and “high life” delicate portraits tulip and insect studies architectural interiors and much more while george abrams the collector was pursuing his personal interests in the arts george abrams the attorney continued to uphold the family legal tradition in practice with his sister and father abrams enjoyed the extensive trial work that came his way the abrams abrams  abrams “shingle” from this era now hangs in his office at hale and dorr then in  abrams accepted a job offer from his harvard college classmate ted kennedy to become general counsel and staff director of the senate judiciary subcommittee on refugees which he ran for three years it was the height of the vietnam war and the committee hearings abrams helped organize addressed the politically risky topic of vietnamese refugees and civilian casualties “things had clearly gone awry in vietnam it was a nowin situation public opinion began to change and looking back i can at least feel we were raising the right questions” in the hearings abrams says he also traveled in egypt lebanon syria israel and elsewhere in the middle east where he visited refugee camps in the west bank and gaza strip both before and after the ’ war in  he joined robert kennedy’s presidential campaign his government service ended abruptly when he returned to boston after the assassinated senator’s burial with no heart for remaining in washington abrams began practicing law again first with his own small firm which gave him the freedom to develop a loyal group of clients while fitting in as much collecting as possible he enjoys that same flexibility in his current association with hale and dorr the independent lawyer’s longtime clients include hls professors and two other men known for blazing their own trails dr judah folkman the scientist whose research is attracting intense international attention and sumner redstone ’ abrams has represented redstone now head of the viacom media company since the s he was deeply involved in redstone’s takeover of viacom and subsequently in the paramount takeover battle among other massive transactions and has been on viacom’s tenmember board of directors since  his work for another client sonesta international hotels allowed abrams to neatly combine lawyering and collecting he was charged with developing a major hotel complex in amsterdam for sonesta which entailed spending a week a month in that city for most of the s into the s — putting abrams in the right place often at the right time to pursue the drawings he and maida wanted while abrams has tracked some drawings on his own typically he and his wife have ventured forth together on countless treks through europe and other countries “it was an allconsuming interest from the very start” abrams recalls “yet we’ve always loved our collecting experiences even under the most difficult circumstances” collecting old master drawings poses many challenges he explains for one thing the works are often unsigned “the collector has to rely on extensive knowledge and experience to determine the artist’s identity the risks of being misled or making mistakes are enormous” — and the abramses experienced both early on they were fast learners however willing to take risks and eager to learn from others they also enjoyed a fleeting advantage by starting out when seventeenthcentury dutch art was not in fashion “we had a clear field for  to  years and had marvelous opportunities that can never be repeated” from the beginning abrams continues “maida and i have insisted that we agree on any drawing we buy and only choose works we really want to look at and live with that approach meant we often purchased works by artists we liked who were less known then many of whom are much better known now it has also allowed us to put together large groups of artists who have become very important today” according to abrams he applies his lawyer’s training to studying and analyzing information about their field and his wife offers incisive judgments about individual works drawing upon her training in the arts sometimes he admits “i become so fascinated with the background and rarity of an artist that maida has to step in and get me back on track” both are dedicated students of their field and their dutch art library in constant use has grown from a few hundred books and catalogues to more than  volumes today in addition to the fogg the abramses have loaned and given works to leading museums throughout the world their drawings have been represented in many major exhibitions including the critically acclaimed hugely popular seventeenthcentury dutch drawings a selection from the maida and george abrams collection which opened at the rijksmuseum in  and traveled to the albertina in vienna and then to the pierpont morgan library in new york before reaching the fogg in  parting with the works of art one loves is the hardest thing a collector can do abrams says “but it was time we want others to enjoy the special magic of our drawings” and so he and maida have entrusted to the fogg and harvard many of their hardwon treasures including two “standing figures of dandies” by willem buytewech the famous a farm on the amsteldijk by rembrandt a “friendship album” consisting of  drawings produced by at least  different artists including the only known drawing by emanuel de witte famed for his paintings of church interiors gerbrand van den eeckhout’s lovely a woman doing handwork and dozens more each telling a tale of the collectors’ taste and aspirations harvard has given an old friend of the abramses’ fogg curator william robinson a new title in recognition of their gift the maida and george abrams curator of drawings robinson is a specialist in dutch work in part because of the abramses’ example while a harvard graduate student in the ’s robinson became interested in seventeenthcentury dutch painting “people told me ‘there are collectors of drawings in the neighborhood you ought to go meet them’” eventually he made his way to the abrams home “i quickly realized their private collection held works by artists i knew weren’t represented in any museum collection in this country and concentrations of important drawings like nothing i had ever encountered” robinson began spending a lot of time with the abramses and their collection and eventually organized the – exhibition maida abrams he observes “prefers to stay in the background but her views are extremely important george will weigh all sides of a question and her opinion will be the decisive factor” as for george abrams “he is one of the most dedicated and committed collectors i’ve ever met i do think if you ask george that his collecting may take priority over his law work” the abramses have not stopped collecting nor has their generous gift to the fogg left empty spaces on their walls their private collection still numbers in the many hundreds of paintings and drawings they will continue the pilgrimages they delight in to the great dutch collections and major auction houses to the offices and homes of the leading dealers curators and scholars maida still heads up the nonprofit very special arts as she has for  years which organizes local and national programs for specialneeds individuals and george is serving his th year on the visiting committee of the harvard art museums he is also a trustee of the boston museum of fine arts a fellow of the morgan library and a member of the prestigious vetting committee for the european fine art fair in maastricht the netherlands these days the drawings they seek are harder to come by says george abrams thanks in no small measure to him and to maida dutch seventeenthcentury art has grown extremely popular and even these two wellconnected savvy collectors face enormous competition still the pleasures of the quest are as strong as ever in a career that has encompassed “the political business legal and art worlds” abrams notes “the last may be the most important to me what i find most exciting is studying old master drawings working on attributions finding new information learning new things” yet despite the fact that his law practice demands much of his attention limiting his time for art sleuthing and exploration abrams says “i wouldn’t have it any other way” all artwork from

favorite chefs has at last written a delicious tome that evokes the delicate balance between fantasy travel to the western mediterranean and local farming in the usa the poetic recipes and the mellifluous prose inspire me to shop to sing fados and to celebrate and cook these alternately exotic and recognizable simple and evocative dishes for my family this book makes me hungry for a visit to both aldea in nyc and the algarve in portugal and will immediately join my kitchen library on the ‘use now and forever’ shelf” — mario batali chefentrepreneur “i have long admired george’s thoughtful evocative cooking at aldea the stories and recipes in my portugal show the passion warmth and generosity of spirit that make his food so delicious” — daniel patterson chef of coi restaurant in san francisco “george is a creative genius whose culinary talent shines through each and every one of his dishes his passion and love for portuguese cuisine is inspiring  and evident in all that he does his recipes are simply delicious and will leave readers with a strong appreciation for portugal and its cuisine” — eric ripert chef of le bernardin in new york city “george is an amazing chef and we share the common approach of bringing our own personal food heritage to new york city his cuisine is filled with the intensely satisfying flavors of a casual portuguese feast—updated with a
