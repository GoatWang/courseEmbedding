burial to  meters in water depths to  meters  ft the cable trenchers depressor can be modified to handle a wide range of cable diameters including split pipe at varying burial depths on a single pass in cooperative soils cabial burial trencher dieseldriven water pump for trencher the system can be operated from a small support barge which houses the systems water pump and diesel engine power supply the pump provides the water pressure for cutting the burial trench and system propulsion with the aid of onboard cameras and instrumentation the sleds forward progress cablefeed configuration and cable burial trencher attitude may be continuously monitored from the surface the cable is captured at the leadin chute at the front and is guided along the leading edge of the stinger to assure full burial of the cable because the cable burial sled is selfpropelled by the water jets risk of damage to the cable is minimized should an anomaly develop anywhere along the cable path l maripro has successfully buried over  kilometers of cable worldwide waterjet trencher at meters water depth and  kts typically meter burial depth cable passing through trencher beneath propulsion jets  copyright

techniques are key to achieving economical submarine cable repairs cable faults can typically be classified into the following categories cable break open fault shunt fault or optical fiber fault depending on the cable fault category the method of cable fault localization will vary l maripro engineers are trained in various methods of fault locating techniques such as single end dc measurements singleend capacitance measurements currentbalance method or optical path methods stateoftheart fiber optic and metallic cable fault localization utilizing longrange optical and metallic

technologies these range from standard trenched approaches with heavy armor or splitpipe to innovative use of drillpipe or existing oil or gas lines and horizontal directional drilling cable crossings l maripro developed the procedures and performed  cable crossings of pipelines and cables during the installation of  kilometers of fiber optic telecommunication cables linking  oil platforms in the gulf of mexico in order to protect and separate the cables from the pipelines a very high density polyurethane segmented covering was applied to the fiber optic cables as they were deployed over the pipelines l maripro has also successfully performed both cable and pipeline crossings for numerous other customers at worldwide locations shore landings l maripro pioneered the application of splitpipe on the system cable aboard the installation vessel while deploying cable and floating it to shore this methodology precludes the need for a nearshore joint or splice decreasing installation time risk and cost l maripro has also successfully utilized reconditioned oil drillpipe assembled on shipboard or shore side and pulled or floated into position for a number of installations further l maripro has installed cables in abandoned gas pipelines on the first such project  km of cable was successfully installed in two different pipelines  km per pipe shorelanding splitpipe chile  shore landing splitpipe indian ocean  shore landing directional drilling wake  horizontal directional drilling horizontal directional drilling hdd or directional boring provides a trenchless method of installing conduits from shore to offshore the system cable is then pulled through the conduit to shore for connection to the systems onshore equipment hdd is used when trenching or excavation is not practical or environmentally desirable hdd is often the preferred method for landing submarine cables onto shore l maripro often works with our customers and qualified hdd suppliers to oversee the shore landing process to insure overall marine installation and project success of the cabled undersea sensor system example of hdd in progress example of hdd in progress Â  offshore platform cable jtube  itube risers l maripro has experience in offshore platform cable landings in water depths from  to  meters l maripro has developed a unique offshore platform cable landing procedure that conforms to api standards utilizing standard platform cable landing hardware such as riser clamps and jtube or itube cable riser systems combined with novel underwater cable storage bins and shipboard deployment rigging l maripro has completed the installation of nine jtube or itube risers for both power and fiber optic cables on nine separate oil field platform structures as on previous similar

hydroacoustic monitoring hydroacoustic monitoring conceptthese systems are designed for monitoring of nuclear events a nuclear explosion generates a very strong source of underwater sound also known as hydro acoustic waves the physical characteristics of the oceans form a sound axis channel known acoustically as the sound fixing and ranging sofar channel which allows these waves to travel for extremely long distances with little energy loss for this reason it is possible to monitor the broad ocean areas of the world with only a small number of hydroacoustic stations a hydroacoustic monitoring system can detect these hydroacoustic waves from remote locations hydroacoustic monitoring systems utilize omnidirectional lowfrequency hydrophones at the center of the lowloss ocean sofar channel the hydrophone stations monitor at the low frequencies suitable for recording explosions at large distances the hydroacoustic monitoring system is particularly effective at discriminating between explosions in the ocean and earthquakes which are the prime source of detected events fiber optic cables bring the signal back to a shore station and transmit this information in nearrealtime to a centralized data processing center these longlife systems utilize design elements common to our undersea defense and ocean science cabled sensor systems highly reliable sensors riser cables electronics modules fiber optic transmission modules pressure vessels backbone cables cable sealing and termination technology and deployment packaging are integrated for worldwide complex inwater installations the hydroacoustic monitoring systems are deployed in groups of three sensor nodes for redundancy and to measure the direction of the event system installation is performed at remote sites around the globe requiring careful attention to logistical planning for successful implementations hydroacoustic system ready for deployment shown adjacent to sister vessel hydroacoustic node Â
