attention to detail and his willingness to answer any and all questions via phone or email during my dealings with him he responded to my myriad of questions usually within an hour or two exceptional for any attorney his office staff is courterious and professional he is serious and diligent in handling cases although the da would not budge for any type of reduced sentence i feel he did the best he could under the circumstances the outcome of the case was not entirely favorable to me as i had two bad options to decide upon looking back i would have explained the details of what happened differently i feel like i blabbered on too much by disclosing to him some personally damaging information thereby not giving him many options to deny what my ex reported to the police he is a very scrupulous person again not a common trait for attorneys being totally honest with him was not in my best interest and feel things would have gone differently had he argued and questioned the validity and proof of my exwifes accusations more fervently it was my word against hers and sadly the judges do tend to lean more to the wifes side of the storyeven without any proof the fact that i had been punched scatched and kicked by my ex several times during our marriage were never even brought before the judge thankfully she and i have developed a decent rapport as the years went by just be cautious and prudent in what you disclose to him that could negatively affect your case but i can tell you that things could have turned out much worse without his representation as he is a well known and respected attorney in the charlotte area the da would not allow us any options for a lesser charge and she was unwilling to compromise in my case the sentencing resulted in a reduction to a pjc but even this created many personal and professional difficulties eg being refused employment on one occasion due to a background check hes a great guy and will work hard for you but in the end its the judges and the das who ultimately call the shots i would still recommend him he is honest and he takes all his cases very seriously the  stars is simply because he was unable to have the case dismissed or at least reduced to a lesser offense which is obviously what people are looking for when they retain counsel he did manage to attain a pjc for the final disposition and i remain grateful for his efforts in doing solaw office of christopher a connellymikemiller ratedthere is no strong lawyer in all of the charlotte area than attorney chris connelly if you are trying to find the best lawyer possible to help you with a case and at a very reasonable price look no further after getting my nd dui in  years i was scared to death and determined to find the best lawyer that i can find to represent me i went in person to interview several lawyers to determine who i felt would have the experience and knowledge to best find a way to get me out of this mess the moment i went to see chris connelly i immediately knew he was good my case got continued several times before going to trial and every time mr connelly entered the courtroom you could see the level of respect other attorneys gave him because it was very clear that he was the real deal chris connelly put in countless hours of study into my personal case to gather all the facts and presented many different and creative strategies in which we could attack our case because of his high level of expertise it almost seemed as if no one was brave enough to stand up against him as a result the state kept asking for continuences totaling nearly two years finally when the day of judgement finally came the trial took nearly no time at all and the judge made the ruling to dismiss the case i was astonished to see how quickly chris connelly won our case for us if you are looking for the best lawyer money can buy rest assured that chris connelly is the best if you are unsure if you can afford such a highly skilled lawyer you would be surprised at how reasonable his rates are if you care about your future like i did hiring attorney chris connelly will be the best decision you can makelaw office of christopher a connellychriscat ratedchris has done it again rd time is charm the first time i used chris he got me off of reckless driving and speeding i contacted him on friday evening and got a email back from him saturday monday morning he called me at like am and informed me the charges were droppednd  incident  caught on hwy  doing mph in my corvette again charges droppedrd screw up and definitely my last i ran from the police on my street bike charged with felony eluding confiscated my bike mph failure to stop and about  other tickets i spent the night in jail and as soon as i got out i contacted chriss office within an hour he called me back and said to come in and talk from there on i didnt have to do anything but show up at court anytime i had a question and emailed chris i had a response within a couple of hours in court the man is awesome he got in front of the judge and made me sound like a medal of honor war hero im a veteran i guess it helped because when it was all said and done my felony was reduced to a misdemeanor speeding was dropped and the only thing i got was reckless driving which is very fair considering i was passing state troopers well over mph inches from their mirrors one occasion i went through two of them so i totally deserve a reckless driving charge last but certainly not least i got my bike back woohooo i cant drive it for a year but thats probably for the best thanks again chris heres another  for this reviewlaw office of christopher a connellyscott c ratedi applied for my ccw permit in june of  i was notified in october of that same year that my permit was denied due to some information shared by my medical provider first the sheriff took more time than what is legally allowed to review my permit second and more importantly i was wrongfully and subjectively categorized as being ineligible to have a ccw permit based on north carolinas mental health law i contacted chris connelly and explained to him my case i could see during our introductory meeting that he was very passionate about defending me as he had heard far too many other cases of honest hardworking lawabiding citizens being denied their second amendment rights based on the subjective thinking of mecklenburg countys liberal activist sheriffi followed chriss instructions to the letter providing him all necessary documentation and referral letters in a timely manner by march of  i was notified that chris had won our appeal and my legal right to possess a ccw was upheldi cannot thank chris connelly enough and would highly recommend anyone faced with a similar case to contact him immediately do not take this challenge on alone you only have one chance at a ccw appeal make it count hire chris connellylaw office of stephen m corbykenneth ratedif you are looking for lawyer please take the time to at least read what i have to say about this incredible lawyer i am almost  years old have hired many attorneys but not one that does this great of a job he listens to what you have to say has a courtroom demeanor that makes you feel like you are being protected and defended in the best possible manner his fees are fair and welldeserved he reviews all aspects and studies your case like it is the only one although he has very many others he is extremely intelligent and knows the law and when to apply it spontaneously and correctly you can trust what he says and what he does he keeps his word if you google this attorney you will find the complete experience that i had with mr corby it is worth the time to review it appears that mr corby has saved me about  in alleged estate debt do you know anyone else that can do that this attorney is both great to work with and a wonderful person he is not arrogant and condescending but caring and attentive hire him quick before your opposition does once you hire him you will understand why i said thatlaw office of christopher a connellyadam w ratedi highly recommend mr connelli highly recommend mr connelly i was charged with a dui a couple years ago and hired a different law firm the case was continued for almost a year which was fine by me but every time i appeared for court there was a different attorney from the firm to whom i had to explain the details of my case i understand that i am not a high profile politician or celebrity but i felt as if they could not have cared less about my situation about a year later i was pulled over and arrested for dwlr and decided to hire mr connelly based on a few recommendations from others who had similar situations when you hire chris you will deal with chris i much prefer this approach and felt as if he gave a damn about me and my situation this was a pretty serious situation considering the dwlr was a result of a dui charge and jail time was a real possibility ultimately mr connelly was able to get the charge completely dismissed this could have had a major impact on my career especially if it resulted in any jail time and i could not be more appreciative of the job that mr connelly didlaw office of christopher a connellytait a ratedrecent international tragedies and violent crimes prompted me to seek a handgun permit that would allow me to take responsibility for my family’s protection so when my permit request was denied i was dismayed and didn’t know what to do fortunately i was referred to christopher connelly an attorney who fervently believes in and was willing to fight for my nd amendment rights mr connelly and his entire staff were professionals in every sense of the word christopher’s counsel was excellent his approach was personable professional and legally sound within a few months my permit was approved and my rights were restoredi firmly believe christopher connelly is the greatest and most qualified nd amendment attorney in charlotte nc i assure you he is on your side and will do everything in his power to receive a judgment in your favor i recommend him in the highest regard and i’m forever grateful to him and his staffpassenant  shearin lawkristen s ratedstrong honest and hard working attorneysi was shocked and did not know where to turn when my divorce began the passenant  shearin law firm was recommended by a friend and i am so thankful they addressed my case swiftly and walked me through the process that is very confusing to a layperson my concerns around false allegations custody and property among many others were all handled aggressively professionally and with my rights being protected i have had the opportunity to work with several members of the firm because they work as a team i am especially thankful to shelia passenant for my initial consultation and hearing along with brione pattison who has walked me through the often difficult process of divorce with custody issues i would highly recommend passenant and shearin law to anyone who wants strong honest and hard working attorneys fighting for your rightsbankruptcy attorney  law offices of terry

the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication

references  especially from individuals who had similar needs  you should broaden your search through public information resources you can call your areas attorney referral service or check legal organizations like martindalehubbell there are other resources available online you should check websites for client reviews and other thirdparty forms of approvalwhen you build a list of possible candidates perform a background check on each one see if you can find information on their history and success record once you find a possible lawyer you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in personby performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs we just

the best tequila in the world tequila has been around for generations but it wasnt until patrón launched in  that the world was introduced to ultrapremium tequila patrón spanish for the good boss is the brainchild of two entrepreneurs john paul dejoria and martin crowley whose love of tequila and desire to create the best tequila in the world led them to the highlands of jalisco mexico there they found tequila industry veteran francisco alcaraz and asked him to produce the most extraordinary highestquality  percent agave tequila possible from that fortuitous meeting patrón tequila was born patróns success is due in no small part to its founders hunch early on that consumers were ready for an ultrapremium luxury tequila a spirits category which at the time didnt exist few exported tequilas back then were created from  percent agave  from the beginning franciscos handcrafted method for patrón included not only  percent weber blue agave but also a centuriesold technique called the tahona process where agave fibers are slowly crushed by a large volcanic stone wheel and then the agave juice is fermented and distilled with the agave fiber francisco created tequila from this process and tequila from the more modern roller mill process and blended them together to become patrón patróns success is due in no small part to its founders hunch early on that consumers were ready for an ultrapremium luxury tequila but to successfully market patrón as a sophisticated drink patróns founders first needed to change the publics perception of tequila early adopters who first tried the product and then told others about it discovered that patróns smooth taste extraordinarily refined flavors and highquality set it apart from other tequilas this was a tequila very different from peoples notion of tequila the companys first tequilas were patrón silver and patrón añejo which were followed in  with the introduction of patrón reposado also launching that year was patrón xo cafe a distinct coffee liqueur characterized by its uniquely dry  not sweet  taste and in  a chocolate coffee liqueur extension called patrón xo cafe dark cocoa was launched and in  the brand introduced a chile chocolate liqueur called patrón xo cafe incendio patrón citrónge an extrafine orange liqueur was also created in  offering patrón lovers the ultimate ingredient for a perfect margarita today that line has expanded to also include patrón citrónge lime liqueur and patrón citrónge mango liqueur in  the year when patrón became the first spirit ever to receive the fivestar diamond award from the american academy of hospitality sciences patrón spirits debuted its gran patrón platinum tequila this super ultrapremium spirit is created from only the finest agave from the harvest tripledistilled for extraordinary smoothness and then packaged in an etched crystal bottle inside an elegant black display case joining gran patrón platinum in  was gran patrón burdeos a beautifully packaged limitedproduction añejo that is aged for a minimum of  months in used american oak barrels distilled again and aged in new french oak before it’s then finished in vintage french bordeaux barrels extending the gran patrón line in  gran patrón piedra was introduced marking patróns first extra añejo tequila aged for more than three years one of the most significant new product launches for the company came in  when patrón introduced roca patrón a line of artisanal tequilas created entirely from the ancient tahona process these tequilas silver reposado and añejo are finished at their own specific proof levels to ensure the best flavor profile for balance and complexity aside from tequila the patrón spirits portfolio also includes pyrat launched in  and ultimat vodka a brand the company acquired in  pyrat is blended and bottled in the caribbean and ultimat is an ultrapremium polish vodka created from a uniquely balanced combination of potato wheat and rye patrón tequilas and liqueurs pyrat and ultimat vodka are today now available in more than  countries and islands across the world and sold in global duty free outlets with a history of solid success in the us patrón spirits began developing and growing its international distribution in  but though patrón tequila continues to grow it is still produced in the same way in the same small batch process that francisco perfected those years ago patrón is also dedicated to limiting the environmental impact of its production several years ago at the distillery a multimillion dollar reverse osmosis plant  the first of its kind in the tequila industry  was completed to reclaim up to  percent of wastewater and turn it into clean water for cooling towers and cleaning processes also leftover agave remnants are turned into organic compost which is donated to community gardens and given to local farmers to spread in their agave fields the hacienda patrón distillery has earned iso  certification and a clean industry certification from profepa the mexican federal environmental protection agency for these efforts to reduce waste lessen emissions and sustain the environment the hacienda patrón distillery is also now connected directly to a natural gas pipeline significantly reducing harmful air emissions in addition to community and environmental efforts in mexico patrón has also given generously over the years to numerous local national and global charitable organizations that help feed the hungry care for the environment and rebuild peoples lives patrón spirits international continues to evolve with its
