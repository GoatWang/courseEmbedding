the motley fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search magna international inc is ready to accelerate its growth magna international inc has an underleveraged balance sheet that it intends to employ before the end of the year matthew dilallo tmfmd oct   at am magna international inc nysemga is already the worlds number two auto parts supplier while holding the top spot in the north american auto market however despite holding strong positions in most of the key auto part product areas the company would like to capture even more of the auto parts market magna international has plans of doing just that as the company believes that its balance sheet is currently a bit under leveraged leaving it room to take on a bit more debt to accelerate growth and capture even more of the auto parts market magna international is already close to the top as the slide below shows magna international holds leading global positons in most of the major product areas source magna international investor presentation however despite being a global leader across several categories magna international still intends to grow its position where it finds attractive opportunities for example earlier this year the company announced the acquisition of getrag which is the largest oemindependent supplier of automotive transmissions in an effort to bolster its powertrain offerings the driving force behind that deal was the fact that magna international has identified growth in the powertrain area and has therefore made it a strategic priority within its portfolio on the other hand the company has not been shy to pare away parts of its portfolio that dont have the same compelling growth prospects thats largely behind the companys decision to sell its interior operations earlier this year magna international isnt satisfied magna international might not be done optimizing its portfolio via acquisitions and divestitures thats because the company has come to the realization that its balance sheet could easily handle more leverage while still staying within its target leverage ratio as the slide below shows the company could add between  million and  billion in debt to its balance sheet while still remaining within its target debttoebitda ratio of  times to  times source magna international investor presentation that debt when combined with the companys strong cash position gives it a lot of money to put to use the company has a variety of potential uses for that cash such as increasing its dividend buying back shares or funding growth both organically and via acquisitions all options appear to be on the table as the company has consistently increased its dividend and it has bought back more than  billion in shares since  including  million over the past year further it is planning to spend upwards of  billion in capex this year to drive organic growth having said all that dont be surprised if magna international uses its balance sheet to drive growth via acquisitions it certainly has a lot of options as it could for example bolster its leading global mirrors position by acquiring autodimming mirror pioneer gentex corporation nasdaqgntx as the slide below shows gentex has a growing share of the growing interior and exterior autodimming mirror marketplace source gentex corporation investor presentation that would certainly fit within the companys desire to bolster its portfolio in product categories that are growing also compelling about gentex is that the  billion company has a cash rich balance sheet with  million in cash against just  million in debt as of the end of last quarter because of that such a deal could conceivably be made for all cash while enabling magna international to stay within its target leverage range another option would be to acquire a company in a new product category an option here for example would be leading safety system supplier autoliv nysealv its a much larger company as its enterprise value is  billion suggesting that such a deal would likely need cash and equity to complete however autoliv would also fit magna internationals priority of targeting a growth market thats because while autolivs revenue last year was  billion the companys plan is to grow its sales to at least  billion by the end of the decade with a potential to reach  billion in sales if it can claim additional market share in other words auto safety parts are a large growth market investor takeaway magna international is currently the second largest auto parts maker in the world with leading positions across several key markets however its not content with that position which is why it continues to refine its portfolio more reshuffling could be on the way with a large acquisition not out of the question due to the fact that the companys leverage ratio is below its target range giving it ample capacity to make a deal matt dilallo owns shares of gentex and has the following options short december   puts on gentex the motley fool owns shares of and recommends gentex the motley fool recommends
