enable optimal workflow during assay manufacturing the different blocking strengths provide the assay developer the flexibility to optimize the elisa during the development phase microarray stabilizers these microarray stabilizers preserve the conformation and activity of proteins bound to microspheres and protein microarrays stored longterm in solution or in the dried state they produce more accurate results by increasing signal and reducing background blocking reagents stabilblot™ blocking buffer family of products enhance sensitivity and minimize background in blotting applications use the blocking buffer family of products to reduce background by blocking unwanted nonspecific binding on all types of membranes such as nitrocellulose and pvdf we offer small ml fills and large bulk fills for these blocking buffer products conjugate stabilizers the stabilzyme® conjugate stabilizers preserve activity of the enzyme hrp or ap and the antibody or antigen of the conjugate complex this allows for the storage of conjugated proteins at lower use concentrations to enable the optimization process during assay development and manufacturing of immunoassays     privacy policy terms of
