the solar panels calculator and enter your address below what rebates solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in california what solar incentives and tax credits are available in california the main incentives to install solar in california is the  federal solar tax credit and the net metering law the upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers however the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates     net metering in california the california public utility commission voted by a narrow majority of  to  to extend the ability of residential energy customers in california to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production whilst this didnt affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in california it was a massive win for the millions of californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels the reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power this is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted it means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility known as a net metering agreement where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power usually for  or  years each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature to see more visit wwwcpuccagovgeneralaspxid     is a purchase lease or ppa agreement best generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home however this is not always the case if you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the  federal solar tax credit in this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit     what is the payback period from installing solar panels in california the payback period from installing solar panels in california is usually between  and  years depending on the size of the system the brand of solar panels you buy the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system this represents an excellent low risk investment     why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in california as california has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power however working this out can be difficult for two reasons firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated the second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices with most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases california solar calculator regardless of what you want to know about the economics of installing solar panels for your home or business in california we have a solar calculator that

loss of some upfront rebates     net metering in california the california public utility commission voted by a narrow majority of  to  to extend the ability of residential energy customers in california to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production whilst this didnt affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in california it was a massive win for the millions of californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels the reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power this is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted it means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility known as a net metering agreement where the

the size of the system the brand of solar panels you buy the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system this represents an excellent low risk investment
