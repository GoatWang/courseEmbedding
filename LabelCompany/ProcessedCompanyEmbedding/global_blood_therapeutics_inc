designation for gbt for the treatment of sickle cell disease jun   global blood therapeutics inc gbt announced that the european medicines agency ema has determined that gbt for the treatment of sickle cell disease is eligible for its priority medicines prime program the prime program is a new regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive ema support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need to be accepted for prime a therapy must demonstrate the potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs through early clinical data the gbt acceptance was supported by data from the ongoing phase  clinical trial gbt evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gbt in both healthy subjects and adults with scd additionally results from this trial coupled with the well understood molecular pathophysiology of scd and the mechanism of action of gbt support the scientific rationale that improvement in hemolysis and hemoglobin may be likely to translate into an improvement in patient symptoms and important disease modification prime is a program launched by the european medicines agency ema to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need this voluntary program is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier through prime the ema offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of medicines applications the goal of the initiative is to help patients benefit as early as possible from therapies that may significantly improve their quality of life scd is a lifelong inherited blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the betachain of hemoglobin which leads to the formation of abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin hbs in its deoxygenated state hbs has a propensity to polymerize or bind together forming long rigid rods within a red blood cell rbc the polymer rods deform rbcs to assume a sickled shape and to become inflexible which can cause blockage in capillaries and small blood vessels beginning in childhood scd patients suffer unpredictable and recurrent episodes or crises of severe pain due to blocked blood flow to organs which often lead to psychosocial and physical disabilities this blocked blood flow combined with hemolytic anemia the destruction of rbcs can eventually lead to multiorgan damage and early death gbt is being developed as an oral oncedaily therapy for patients with scd gbt works by increasing hemoglobins affinity for oxygen since oxygenated sickle hemoglobin does not polymerize gbt believes gbt blocks polymerization and the resultant sickling of red blood cells with the potential to restore normal hemoglobin function and improve oxygen delivery gbt believes that gbt may potentially modify the course of scd in recognition of the critical need for new scd treatments the us food and drug administration fda has granted gbt both fast track and orphan drug designations for the treatment of patients with scd and the european commission ec has designated gbt as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with scd gbt is currently evaluating gbt in the hope hemoglobin oxygen affinity modulation to inhibit hbs polymerization study a phase  clinical trial in patients age  and older with scd additionally gbt is being studied in the ongoing phase  gbt trial and in the ongoing hopekids  study an openlabel single and multipledose study in adolescents age  to  with scd designed to assess the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of gbt global blood therapeutics inc announces new data supporting ongoing clinical development of gbt in adolescents with sickle cell disease jun   global blood therapeutics inc announced the presentation of preliminary results from the singledose adolescent cohort of the ongoing hopekids  study a phase a openlabel study of gbt in adolescents with sickle cell disease scd the results which demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of gbt are similar in adolescents and adults were presented at the nd congress of the european hematology association eha in madrid the pharmacokinetics pk of gbt are similar in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease scd hopekids  gbt is an openlabel single and multipledose study that is evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of gbt in adolescents age  to  years with scd results presented at eha showed that in adolescents who received a single oral dose of  mg of gbt the pharmacokinetics and halflife of gbt were similar in adolescents and adults with results supporting oncedaily dosing and a high specificity for hemoglobin and gbt was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events related to study drug observed

after pricing details are released from the companys recently announced common stock offering brian feroldi tmftypeoh feb   at am what happened after global blood therapeutics nasdaqgbt a clinicalstage biotech focused on bloodbased disorders announced the pricing details of a secondary offering its shares fell as much as  in earlymorning trading on wednesday  so what global blood therapeutics said it is selling  million shares of common stock to the public for  per share that should net the company  million after deducting fees the underwriters of the deal have also been granted the option to purchase up to  additional shares stock if they choose the deal is expected to close within the next few days wall street is reacting harshly to this news because the companys closing share price on tuesday was  thus it appears global blood had to offer a big discount to attract enough buyers that could be because the original announcement of the share price offering only called for it to sell  million worth of its stock managements decision to supersize the offering could be the primary reason that a big discount was needed  image source getty images given the extra dilution and lessthanhopedfor price it is no surprise to see shares tumbling today now what global bloods stock has been on a monster run since the start of the year rising more than  since jan  the jump is attributable to a handful of news items first the first patient has been enrolled in the companys phase  hope study this trial is researching its lead compound  gbt  as a hopeful treatment for sickle cell disease data from earlier trials suggests that gbt has a real shot at helping to treat this disease if true it is possible that the compound could go on to become a blockbuster next a paper describing the discovery of gbt was published online in acs medicinal chemistry letters a peerreviewed publication  finally the company initiated a phase  study to evaluate the physiologic effects of using gbt in health patients under hypoxemic conditions the goal of the trial is to further understand the safety and efficacy profile of the compound  given that shares have responded so positively to this news it seems like a good time to raise cash of course investors still have quite a bit of waiting to do to find out how well gbt performs in the hope trial  topline data isnt expected until  meanwhile global bloods competitor bluebird bio continues to research its product candidate lentiglobin as a potential cure for sickle cell disease if bluebird

that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus
