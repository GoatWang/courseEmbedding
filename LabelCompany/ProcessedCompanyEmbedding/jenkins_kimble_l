interventions we appreciate your interest in our company and for those of you who are shareholders thank you for your support were honored to be working for you in building this great company we had a very strong quarter we reported record total product revenues we reported record disposable product revenues we have generated eight consecutive quarters of sequential growth in revenues from our disposable products were now at  clearpoint sites drug delivery trials are going well our cleartrace development effort in coordination with siemens is going well and we believe medtronic’s acquisition of visualase which was announced last week is a very positive development for our company and for our emerging field ill come back to you with some additional comments in a minute but for now id like to turn the call over to david carlson our cfo to walk you through our second quarter results david david w carlson thanks kim were pleased to report a strong second quarter ill first cover the results for the quarter and then well talk about what happened in the first half of the year for the quarter we recorded total product revenues of  million compared to  in q of last year more than doubling representing an increase of  disposable product revenues were  in q of this year compared with  in the second quarter of  representing growth of  we recognized  in product revenue related to our clearpoint capital products compared to  in the same period in  due to the nature of capital product sales clearpoint capital product revenues may vary significantly for us from quarter to quarter other service revenues related mostly to installation services and clearpoint service agreements were  in q of this year and there were no such revenues recorded during the same period last year development service revenues related to contract product development were  in q of this year compared to  in the same period in  the decrease reflects the completion of a development project the company has been performing on a contract basis the company does not expect development service revenues to be an ongoing source of revenues cost of product revenues was  for q of  compared to  for the same period last year an increase of  the increase in cost of product revenues of  was less than the  increase in product revenues as were beginning to leverage certain fixed costs over a greater production volume research and development costs were  in q of  compared to  for the same period in  selling general and administrative expenses were  million in the second quarter of this year compared to  million for q of  net other income was  for q of  compared to  for the same period last year net interest expense was  for q of this year compared with  for q of  our net loss for the quarter was  million or  per share compared with a net loss of  million or  per share in q of last year during the first half of  we recorded product revenues of  million compared to  for the first six months of last year an increase of  disposable product revenues were  million for the first six months of this year compared with  for the same period in  representing growth of  clearpoint capital product sales were  in the first six months of this year compared to  for the same period in  product revenues for the first half of  included  in cleartrace system components sold to a site for research use other service revenues related to installation services and clearpoint service agreements were  in the first half of  and again no such revenues were recorded in the prior year period development service revenues related to contract product development were  for the first half of  compared to  for the same period in  the company recorded license revenues of  during the first six months of  while no such revenues were recorded during the same period in  the decline was attributable solely to the expiration of the revenue recognition period for license fees the company received in  from boston scientific that were deferred and recognized over time cost of product revenues was  for the first half of  compared to  for the same period last year an increase of  this increase in cost of product revenues of  was less than the  increase in product revenues as again were beginning to leverage some of our fixed costs over our greater production volumes research and development costs were  million for the first half of  compared to  million for the same period in  selling general and administrative expenses were  million for the first six months of  compared to  million for the first half of  during the first half of  the company recorded a gain of  million related to the sale of certain intellectual property to boston scientific the purchase price was satisfied through the cancellation of notes payable previously issued to boston scientific in the aggregate principal amount of  million the company recorded a gain equal to the purchase price as the assets sold had not been previously recorded on the company’s balance sheet net other income was  million for the first six months of  compared to  million for the same period last year net interest expense for the first six months of  was  compared with  for the same period in  for the first six months of  the company recorded net income of  million which resulted in earnings per share of  compared to a net loss of  million for the same period in  which resulted in a net loss per share of  moving over to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a cash balance of  million our cash burn for the quarter was  million which was up from  million in the first quarter the additional cash used in operations relate in large part to spending related to conferences as two of our most significant medical conferences were held in q we also had an increase in professional fees associated with the timing of patent filings and patent prosecution our net cash burn when compared to q was also negatively impacted by the lower accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter which turned into cash collections in q compared with the ar balance at the yearend that was converted to cash in q our accounts receivable collections continue to be predictable and steady as we ended the quarter with a dso of  days our inventory levels have increased by approximately  since yearend as a result of planned growth in sales and the impact of product line extensions weve strengthened our balance sheet during the first half of the year which is evidenced by the  million reduction in current liabilities when comparing our june  balance sheet with our balance sheet at yearend with that ill turn it back over to kim kimble l jenkins thanks david so im very pleased we had a very strong quarter id like to take a minute to provide some additional commentary on a few items first as david mentioned we reported record product revenues of  million which is up yearoveryear and also up sequentially  over our first quarter we reported record disposable product revenues of  which is up yearoveryear and also up sequentially  over our first quarter we now have eight consecutive quarters of sequential growth in our disposable product sales this is an important trend since our disposable product revenues are the key driver to our business with our razorblade business model we are pleased to add three new clearpoint sites duke university health system robert wood johnson university hospital and the university of michigan this brings our current number of sites to   in the united states and  in europe our footprint is growing our presence within the neurosurgeon community continues to build during the quarter we participated in two major neurosurgeon conferences the american association of neurological surgeons annual meeting in san francisco and the american society for stereotactic and functional neurosurgery biennial meeting in washington both events were very successful for us with neurosurgeon podium presentations on clearpoint and a substantial level of activity in our booth as you are aware we are involved in six drug trials in which our clearpoint system is being used in the direct delivery of drug to neurological target four of the trials relate to delivering drug to treat brain tumors two of the trials relate to delivering drug to treat parkinsons disease these trials are going well the procedures are going well and clearpoint is performing as promised last week medtronic announced its acquisition of a company called visualase we view this as a significant development for our emerging field and a significant development for our company so id like to take a minute to provide a bit more color for those of you that dont know visualase they are a privately held company that markets a product for mri guided laser ablation we have known and worked closely with visualase for a number of years our clearpoint system is highly complementary to the visualase product let me elaborate a little on how the companys two products work together our clearpoint system enables the placement of the visualase laser catheter under realtime mri guidance and is increasingly being used in visualase procedures heres why in a visualase case without clearpoint the patient is brought to the operating room the neurosurgeon and his team then use conventional stereotaxi to blindly place the visualase catheter without visualization the patient is then bundled up and transported to the mri suite where the surgeon gets his first view of where the laser is relative to the target anatomy if the laser catheter is in the wrong location the patient is then taken off the mri table transported back to the operating room where the laser catheter is repositioned after completing the repositioning the patient is again bundled up and transported back again to the mri suite for the surgeon to see if the laser is in the correct location assuming yes then the laser is turned on and the energy is delivered needless to say this is cumbersome workflow for the neurosurgeon and his team this is also highly inefficient for the hospital because it ties up two rooms both the neuro operating room and the mri suite by comparison in a clearpointvisualase procedure the entire procedure is performed in one room the mri suite and the workflow is a simple streamlined approach the patient is brought to the mri suite the laser is placed using realtime mri guidance the laser is turned on and the energy is delivered so clearpoint enables a oneroom procedure instead of two no neuro operating room usage no transporting the patient back and forth and clearpoint enables a highly accurate fully visualized procedure without clearpoint the placement of the visualase laser catheter is performed blind with clearpoint the neurosurgeon can see what hes doing the laser catheter is placed under intraoperative visualization since the clearpoint technologies and the visualase technologies are complementary weve enjoyed a strong collaborative relationship with visualase going forward we look to continue that relationship as medtronic takes over the sales of the visualase product and were excited about the potential that medtronic sales force brings because they are many times larger than the visualase sales force we view the visualase acquisition as noteworthy for two other reasons first we see this transaction as a powerful endorsement of the emerging field of mriguided therapies our fundamental business premise is that the delivery of therapies under mri guidance is the next inevitable evolutionary step in neurosurgery we believe medtronics acquisition is strong evidence that the industry agrees with our view second we believed that visualases transaction price is a positive indicator of the value in our company lastly a quick comment on our cleartrace program were continuing to make good progress in our development efforts in coordination with our partner siemens healthcare as noted in our press release this afternoon we remain on track for an initial european product release of our cleartrace system in the fourth quarter of next year all in all we had a very strong quarter our company is growing and our field is growing with that ill open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jose haresco with jmp securities please proceed with your question jose haresco  jmp securities quick question just on housekeeping item you did  systems capital sold this quarter here could you give me an exact number of those systems and the asp associated with that kimble l jenkins that was four system sales is that correct david w carlson correct kimble l jenkins yes theres four system sales david w carlson the price on the system sales can vary from hospital to hospital in large part due to be equipment that hospital may or may not already have and so that factors into an asp if you took that  divided by four jose haresco  jmp securities thank you the visualase acquisition is also very significant what response or what have your customers said since that news hit and i guess how is your interaction with visualase if any changed since that news broke kimble l jenkins with regard to visualase again weve known these guys for a very long time we work closely with them and they are excited about it and were excited for them its really business as usual in that regard and for the neurosurgeons for the folks weve talked with i think it is good news there not surprising the two technologies work really well together thats a wellknown fact and so again i think that all in all its a positive announcement for everybody involved operator our next question comes from the line of steven schwartz with first analysis please proceed with your question steven schwartz  first analysis just carrying on from joses question you said four systems but you noted three sites is that to say you sold two systems at one site or could you clarify that for me david w carlson the systems that were sold were actually part of our clearpoint placement program that were existing sites as of the end of the first quarter that we sold during the second quarter so none of the three sites that were mentioned as new sites are sites that we sold systems to during the quarter steven schwartz  first analysis i see okay and then you did address it in your commentary but if i could ask the  in the second quarter compared to the number of systems sold in the second quarter of  versus the revenue so a big disparity and you did just touch on the fact that it can depend on what equipment is already existing at the hospital but if you look at your pipeline and for forecasting purposes for us going forward what should we be thinking about in terms of a per system asp kimble l jenkins so on asp steven to make sure i follow your question youre kind of wondering about an average selling price per clearpoint system for the capital steven schwartz  first analysis yes and understanding that it can vary widely from site to site and so forth but just in terms of helping us understand going forward for the next couple of quarters and what you see in the pipeline kimble l jenkins i think a good number to use is  it does vary but i think  is a good average number to use steven schwartz  first analysis okay alright thats helpful kimble l jenkins just to elaborate a little bit on that we have – over the last year or so weve been able to utilize to find ways to utilize equipment that already exists at the hospital so they dont have to buy it from us and thats actually whats been its been the largest driver of the reduction in the price of our clearpoint capital component this is a good news for us weve got this razor razor blade model and so to the extent we dont have to sell for example a head coil if the hospital already has a set of coils that will work then thats fine for us david w carlson and i guess one other comment on that is that the items that we are no longer selling were typically our lowest margin products so we werent – it didnt – we were happy to see that change take place steven schwartz  first analysis okay so mix is improving in what youre selling and then if i could ask a followup question and along the same lines of kind of what the revenue run rate is were there any delays in the first quarter with orders or any kind of inventory build in the second quarter in terms of the specially disposable product revenue what should we think about from an average quarter to quarter basis or normalized run rate here for the next couple of quarters kimble l jenkins so i guess couple of comments one is were not giving guidance at this point so ill limit – ive got some limitation there steven but whats happening as we build our business we are getting into more sites obviously more cases are getting done more cases are getting done leading to an increase in our disposable product revenue and thats the way this is supposed to work and i think what you see were quite proud im particularly proud of those eight consecutive quarters of growth in our disposable product revenues thats a nice run that were proud of and i think i guess it speaks to sort of the way the business is building again without going and giving guidance i think it speaks to the way the business is building for us steven schwartz  first analysis yes no doubt impressive but you dont see any pull forward of orders or that theres nothing like that but you can see with the second quarter numbers kimble l jenkins i mean its just – one of the reasons were not giving guidance right now is that we are the pioneers in this field right were literally creating this market and were excited about the growth were experiencing were excited about and encouraged by what were seeing however with this new market comes a lot of variables variables for us as well as variables for the emerging field and so its hard to although i know it would be helpful to try to draw some conclusions for you these variables still make it little hard to give you metrics which maybe is what youre looking for steven schwartz  first analysis yes understandable thank you kim nice quarter operator our next question is from james terwilliger with newport coast securities please proceed with your question james terwilliger  newport coast securities congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for taking my question a lot of my questions have been answered but the first one is really how is the tone on the clinical conferences in san fran and dc in terms of the clinical community in adopting this type of technology what was the tone like from the clinicians kimble l jenkins its very positive james really each conference that we go to the momentum builds the chatter builds the number of cases that have gotten done the presentations the activity at our booth the discussions at dinners all of that is growing and whats neat about it is its growing across different kinds of neurosurgeons so as you know we facilitate electrode placement dbs electrode placement for example for parkinsons and dystonia patients and thats one sort of neurosurgeon the epilepsy application that were pursuing in connection with for example visualase thats often a different kind of neurosurgeon a different guy andor girl and thats another set of discussions the biopsy applications brings in the tumor docs and so we are really building were building this critical mass at these conferences and were building these sort of subsets of doctors that are getting excited and thats been our objective all along and were seeing it really bear fruit success to get success and so when you go from six sites to seven sites youve got one level of momentum and when you go from  sites to  sites its just a lot easier james terwilliger  newport coast securities excellent the second question is the medtronic acquisition of visualase is very exciting do you see any say sales and marketing displacement by the acquisition something you guys could capitalize on and expand your sales force and remind me again how large your sales and marketing department is currently kimble l jenkins sure weve got  people in our sales marketing and support team david w carlson  kimble l jenkins  sorry and david probably six six sales folks that includes rob our vp of sales five clinical field support people and the balance in marketing and support case support so thats our group so as i mentioned in our prepared remarks weve been working closely with the visualase guys really for many years i mean going back to like  or maybe before actually before then theyve been around for a long time weve been around for a long time we wanted to make sure our products would work together from the very beginning for the reasons i outlined a minute ago we have had a very natural collaboration at the field level at the account level with visualase again because of the complementary nature of our products and we have every expectation that that will continue as medtronic takes over this sales effort now the leverage there would come from the fact that the medtronics sales force is many many times larger than the visualase sales force and were excited about where that may take us james terwilliger  newport coast securities okay again thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a good quarter operator our next question is from bruce conway ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified participant first i just want to say great quarter and great comments regarding the significance of visualase acquisition to mri i was however a little disappointed there wasnt a better stock market reaction to that because i happen to agree i think its extremely significant for us and in that light i wanted to ask have you seen any revenue projections regarding medtronics acquisition and does that give you any color and i realize this is forwardlooking but does that give you any color for possible revenue projections for us kimble l jenkins bruce im not aware i havent seen any projections from medtronic with regard to kind of what theyre hoping to do with this business one could assume i think and safely assume that they expect to grow the business so i dont have a direct answer what i can say is to reiterate what weve talked about i think many of the folks on this call would have heard us talk about the size of the epilepsy market right so we believe one of the primary drivers of visualase and the acquisition of visualase by medtronic was presumably going after this epilepsy market and the epilepsy market is a really exciting one there are  million patients in the united states that suffer from epilepsy a little over  or  of those patients are treatment refractory what that means is a drug simply dont work in eliminating the seizures and so the quality of life for these  patients is very poor that population is really center of the bullseye for laser ablation therapy where you go in ablate the epileptic foci and the idea is the clinical objective of that is to eliminate the seizures so we think theres an enormous amount of potential in bringing this powerful therapy to that large patient population and we think thats part of what has excited medtronic about it unidentified participant great okay thank you kim operator our next question is from michael swarovski ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified participant i just first of all like to see if someone can verify that if the equipment is being used at the ohio state university in columbus ohio kimble l jenkins yes unidentified participant i was told that the doctors there actually fight to get their patients listed on the use for the next day and that usually the senior doctors are the ones that end up using the process my question is as im a layman is that most of the time we hear and learn that operations are to be done a  sterile room consider the operating room is there anything kickback from physicians or anyone else that these procedures are done in an mri room versus the operating room kimble l jenkins great question and this is one of the key hurdles that we had to get over we do create a sterile environment in a diagnostic mri suite for performing these clearpoint procedures we take a nonsterile environment and create a sterile environment for the procedure so youre exactly right in the question that you raised the way we do it is we developed a sterile draping system that we had to get fda clearance for specific for that draping system to create that sterile environment and thats worked very well for us is it a matter of discussion for new hospitals absolutely we always with no exception we always meet with the sterility committee inside of a new hospital and we share with them the results weve had at all the rest of the hospitals the very strong good results that weve had with creating this sterile environment for these procedures we walk them through the data that we have that shows that were successful in creating a sterile environment and again as you can tell with the number of sites we are successful in getting the sterility committees comfortable with this new approach but youre right on the money its an issue that we had to solve and were pleased that we solved it operator our next question comes from raymond pirrello with pendulum please proceed with your question kimble l jenkins ray are you okay hello operator operator he must have gone cut off okay our next question comes from mark abraham ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified participant i have some questions as far as numbers go im kind of a numbers guy and you lost  million this quarter and im trying to get a handle on at what point can you guys make a profit because the stock price is anemic and its probably the reason because people are looking at some point for you to make some money and by going with an extra three installations i mean how many more installations do you need to get to to make a profit and the one thing here last quarter you did about  worth of business and my question is how many procedures – theyre all  a procedure is that all right kimble l jenkins yes  is sort of the average selling price unidentified participant so its around  procedures over the whole quarter which is around three procedures per place per quarter which is like one a month and is that what its going to be do you see more procedures being done because at some point if you keep losing  million a quarter youre out of money in three quarters so im just trying to look at numbers at some point when youre going to make some money i know you dont like to go forward and everything like that but you want to know when youre going to make money before theyre going to invest in your company ive been investor since day one before you went public kimble l jenkins mark we appreciate your support and let me – ill start and david may want to chime in first let me speak to sort of utilization right so we have in our sites in our set of sites we got some sites that are highvolume users and some that are lowvolume users and a big part of that sort of phenomenon is really just part and parcel of growing the business its kind of like if anybody is invested in – its kind of like the samestore sales model for a retail operation you set up a new store you make investments in it and theres a certain level of sales in the first month and then it takes some number of quarters for that site to that store to mature and youve got marketing to bring customers in and that sort of thing so our business is not really all that different from this weve got sites that are mature and that we would consider highvolume users and we got sites that are relatively immature and that were growing so the numbers that you gave just i would amend that just a little bit just to say if you think about our business growing you got to think about sites some sites being mature some sites sort of being in process some being new or relatively immature and thats got that has a big bearing as far as the number ill tell you i think that a breakeven for us is going to be about  procedures a month is that right based on our current infrastructure is that about right david david w carlson yes kimble l jenkins so that will give you a sense of kind of where were headed so mark is that responsive to you unidentified participant so if you do  a month so youre doing about  a quarter now so you need to triple your procedures to breakeven and the other thing is the sales force you have out there coming in with three extra sites here and when can they really do something do you have anything in your horizon at all about possibly partnering up with a big medical device company that can get out and sell these placements if youre going to sell three sites a quarter youre never going to get it done kimble l jenkins so i understand what youre saying but i want to point out that we grew disposable product revenue  sequentially q over q right and so there is inherent leverage in our business model right and as we were talking about we get the store set up and then we grow revenue and for us the driver the key is getting that disposable revenue which grows our business there is again inherent leverage now leverage comes from taking a site thats doing one case a month and getting them to do two cases a month or three cases a month and we replicate that across  or  or  sites then theres real leverage in it and thats really what weve been working to build mark over the last handful of quarters we got a great sales team in place finally we got a strong clinical support team in place we got a wide group of applications that range from treating parkinsons patients with dbs electrode placement to laser ablation for epilepsy so all of these things are a part of really growing that utilization and thats what propels growth and again i understand the numbers are still small but we grew revenue disposable product revenue  from q to q and i think to me that is evidence that the model is working unidentified participant well percentage is – you just put numbers on the board you still have to make money and youve got a  million market cap rate now and the reason this things doesnt go up is because everyone is looking when theyre going to make some money and youve got these big and big numbers i mean you say  those sound nice but its the real dollars of cash that really make a difference kimble l jenkins but mark with all due respect it is real cash  in disposable revenue again more than  in q you said youre a numbers guy i mean thats real growth thats real growth and it doesnt take many of those it doesnt take growth like that for long to be real numbers if you look over again the business were eight quarters in a row of growing that disposable revenues now i will say look why does this take time the reason it takes time is we are changing physician practice we are creating a new field of medicine and that takes time but its working its working and again thats why were in the hospitals that we are in were in five of the top  us news and world report surgery centers some of the best doctors in the country are using clearpoint and increasing their use so look it does take time but i would again id respectfully just push back a bit and say were getting there were making it happen unidentified participant i think the product is fantastic i mean i dont understand why a hundred hospitals dont sign up i mean what is their reasoning why dont they want it i mean everybody should have it its the best thing out there theres nothing – you guys got the greatest product in the world why arent people flocking beating it to a down park ph thats the base of my question kimble l jenkins i couldnt agree with you more that weve got a great product and were pleased with all the things that were seeing that indicate that adoption is increasing and that leads to growth in the business so look there may be frustration with regard to – people would like things to happen faster i would too but i would say im quite pleased with the way the business is growing we feel very good about our positioning in this marketplace we are excited about not only the way our business is developing and building our revenues are building but the fact that you got other players like a medtronic saying this field is important and its important for neurosurgery going forward but again and id be happy i dont want to go too long on this id be happy to talk with you further offline mark if you want unidentified participant no i appreciate you taking my call indiscernible i think you guys got a great thing i just wish there were some more people that would want it and that was my only concern kimble l jenkins thank you calling in mark operator our next question is from jeff romoff ph a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified participant just wanted to further on marks comment what discussion has there been around or what implications might there be at providing the hardware at an extremely discounted rate or even at no cost if you really want to grow the disposable business kimble l jenkins there are compliance hurdles to just giving it away the guys in washington dont let medical device companies give away capital and so weve got to get value for the capital piece we think our clearpoint placement program is a good way to stay well within the confines of the compliance of the regulations and be square with all those but at the same time give the neurosurgeons flexibility to bring the system in and we think that works pretty well youll see that again so for example in this last what we are reporting here the four sites the four system sales that we had during the quarter were to existing they were to sites that existed before the quarter and our new sites are under the clearpoint placement program so we think its a good model for us unidentified participant okay im just trying to brainstorm ideas as mark points out trying to just get into the new hospitals that seems to be the biggest hurdle right kimble l jenkins look we tell our sales guys to do we ask them to do two things we ask them to grow the number of sites and we ask them – so we want new sites in the pipeline and we want to increase utilization at our existing sites so they split their time between both efforts and thats going to be – well continue with that going forward with that direction for these folks unidentified participant okay thanks for taking the question operator our next question is from steven schwartz with first analysis please proceed with your question steven schwartz  first analysis i thought i would jump back on the call into this discussion from the last two callers and ask your opinion on and perspective on something we understand that the hospital environment is changing surgeons are going from private practice to becoming direct employees where the surgeon was the sole decisionmaker there are now these valueadded committees when you are partnered up with a visualase are the valueadded committees are you riding in to the purchase decision by the hospitals with visualase and these other companies or are you guys going up against the committee decision singlehandedly kimble l jenkins thats a great question and as we were developing clearpoint weve envisioned it from the beginning as a platform right and why is that important the platform side is important because we have a product that helps the functional neurosurgeon with his movement disorder patients for electrode placement and we help the epilepsy neurosurgeon who is treating his patients with now laser ablation and the neurosurgeon the tumor doc and so when we go through the hospital process steven our champion or champions are the neurosurgeons and what helps a lot with these multiple applications is that you have not just one neurosurgeon saying i want to use this for my parkinsons patients but we can bring three neurosurgeons in the guy for the parkinsons patients the guy for the epilepsy patients the guy for the tumor patients and yes to the extent weve got the epilepsy and tumor patients then that brings in visualase and visualase is a part of that so there is leverage there thats sort of inherent in our platform model and its positive leverage its very helpful to us steven schwartz  first analysis yes no doubt i recognize that i think like the previous callers i certainly recognize that but do you agree that the environment overall has become more difficult not only because of obamacare but just because of the change in the surgeonhospital relationship kimble l jenkins absolutely listen healthcare is a different animal now than it was even five years ago and my feeling is a med device company whether youre large or small has to show up with a very compelling value argument for the patients were going to be better with the patients for the doctor its got to be a procedure that the doctor wants to do over the existing approach and for the cfo its got to work for the economics of the hospital and by the way with obamacares take in healthcare its got to work for the eventual payer right so youve got to hit on all cylinders we feel strongly that clearpoint delivers on all of those metrics and were doing that by again moving – were doing it in a way that weve already seen it play out in other fields weve already seen this movie for taking care of heart attacks you saw the move from open heart surgery to minimally invasive cath lab based procedures and that helps everybody right the hospitals the surgeons the patients the payers it was a win for everybody and were enabling that same thing that same idea of realtime minimally invasive imageguided procedure which was done in a cath lab were enabling that same thing for neurosurgery and so i think absolutely its a much harder environment now than it was a few years ago but fortunately were wellprepared for it and i think thats going to stand us in good stand over the coming months it has already and it will continue to do that it will continue to bear fruit for us steven schwartz  first analysis yes no doubt okay thank you for the additional color kim operator our next question is from raymond pirrello with pendulum please proceed with your question raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets how many sales guys are on the ground that signed up the three hospitals how many guys do we have out there kimble l jenkins we have six salespeople raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets okay whats the criteria for these guys to keep their jobs i mean you have only three hospitals with six guys i mean whats their daily routine how many hospitals are they able to see a quarter kimble l jenkins bear in mind they are not just selling capital they are working on increasing utilization so they are spending some percentage of their time growing utilization and the other percentage of their time getting these sites so they are involved on those two metrics not just one raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets im involved on other medical device fields right now and theyve outsourced their sales forces and their margins and their business arent as big but they are already in  something hospitals because of that have you guys looked into possibly bringing in some of these guys that do the sales for you kimble l jenkins sure weve considered distribution relationships or outsourcing but we are creating a field were the pioneers in this new field of medicine and because of that we need our own sales guys its something weve looked at closely and again we feel a high degree of confidence that thats the right way of going at it at this point in the development of the market raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets at some point you have to see theres going to be something else that comes to the market a replacement of possibly you guys at some places or products right so you want to get as far stretched as you can across hospitals before another product comes to the market kimble l jenkins thats why we work to grow the number of sites to grow at sites that are the leaders in their respective fields the volume centers we want to keep getting those guys and were doing it and then we want at the same time to grow utilization raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets is it a capital issue is there more cash you need to hire more guys out there or youre not ready for that at this point kimble l jenkins again we feel good about the team weve got in place we spent a lot of time last year getting the right guys in place getting them trained getting them going and weve really got a lot of confidence ray in the team weve got raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets so worldwide sales you think six guys are enough kimble l jenkins no its just were just us we got the two sites in europe but were really focused all of our energies are focused on united states now at some point we have ce mark for this product well go ous but now its really focused on the united states raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets how many hospitals are in your target market kimble l jenkins its probably about  about  raymond pirrello  pendulum capital markets alright kimble l jenkins look ray thanks so much for calling in and happy to talk further with you if you want were always around i dont want to bore everybody so operator maybe one more call operator there are no further questions at this time would you like to make any closing remarks kimble l jenkins no listen thanks for joining us for the call we appreciate your interest we appreciate your support for those of you that are shareholders and please stay in touch
