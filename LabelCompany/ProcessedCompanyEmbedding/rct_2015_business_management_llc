requirements for pennsylvania llcs annual registration unlike most states pennsylvania does not require llcs to file an annual report however professional limited liability companies pllcs and foreign llcs engaged in professional services must file a  certificate of annual registration  form  dscb  with the department of state these must  be filed with the corporation bureau by april th of every year the registration is filed  online  or by postal mail an annual fee of  times the number of members of the llc must be paid state business tax when it comes to income taxes most llcs are socalled passthrough tax entities in other words the responsibility for paying federal income taxes passes through the llc itself and falls on the individual llc members in most states llcs themselves do not pay income taxes only their members do starting with tax year  pennsylvania will no longer impose a capital stockfranchise tax on llcs or require llcs to file form rct pa corporate tax report with the department of revenue dor llcs required to file form rct for the  reporting period should mark that return as their final return check with the  department of revenue  dor for more information in some cases the owners of an llc choose to have their business treated like a corporation for tax purposes this choice is made by filing irs form  with the irs see the irs website for the form unlike the default passthrough tax situation when an llc elects to be taxed as a corporation the company itself must file a separate tax return the state of pennsylvania like almost every other state has a
