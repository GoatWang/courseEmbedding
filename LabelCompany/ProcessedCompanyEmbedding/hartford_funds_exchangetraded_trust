defensive characteristics by having greater diversification on multiple levels in the portfolio can you tell us about the strategy around launchingi’d love to riskoptimized real estate is a strategy that invests in a wide universe of reits that are available in the us when you’re looking at the market there are about  companies that are investable but what we typically find in most reit strategies and reit capitalizationweighted indexes is high concentration in a handful of individual reitsso this strategy seeks to enhance diversification and access the broader opportunity set while at the same time focus on deploying capital to companies that have a combination of attractive attributes in terms of their valuation their quality and growth characteristics and their momentumwe’re very excited to be at the new york stock exchange – it’s a great institution and of course being the first etf launch since we’ve become part of the hartford funds family is also very special what are
