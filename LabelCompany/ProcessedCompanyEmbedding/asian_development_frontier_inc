and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation if the company does not raise all of the money it needs from public offerings it will have to find alternative sources such as a second public offering a private placement of securities or loans from its officers directors or others if the company requires additional cash and is unable to raise it it will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised or cease business entirely the ability of the company to
