predictions and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industrys actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements for a description of such risks and uncertainties refer to our registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission while these forwardlooking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business actual results will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results corporate background we were incorporated in delaware on november   and are a development stage company on december   we entered into an exclusive assignment agreement with mr uri tagger inventor in relation to a patentpending invention for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine the assigned technology has the potential to be adopted as a standard in all hospitals and care centers for improving the safety of medication administration specifically the invention is intended to match drug name voice templates as a threshold mechanism for unlocking a medication container such as a syringe or pill box this invention is intended to help minimize accidentally administering the wrong medication to a patient by requiring a caregiver such as a doctor or a nurse to verbally announce the name of the medication that should be administered if the medicine does not match the verbally announced name of the medication the medicine cannot be administered the patentpending technology was transferred to safecode drug technologies corp by mr uri tagger inventor in exchange for a commitment to pay  of future royalties on any revenues we may derive from the patent this agreement was executed on december   the assigned patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine is intended to feature several components including a drug name identifier a computer readable medium containing a stored template that identifies the drug trade name the compound name etc a processing unit capable of sending the stored voice templates to a computer and a software application hosted on a computer system the computer will have standard equipment such as a motherboard keyboard mouse monitor etc but also have a microphone capable of receiving voice commands and recording the voice templates against which the voice commands are compared the computer to be used with the technology will be required to have internet capabilities including an internal modem or a connection to a modem and internet access to enable the program to access a central repository of stored voice templates of drug brand names generic brand names or a combination of both the audio recording program should include voice recognition software for interacting with the microphone and to record the voice templates we plan to license the patent to a thirdparty to design manufacture and market the device against an initial payment to us and a percentage licensing agreement to be paid quarterly our business we were incorporated in delaware on november   and are a development stage company an assignment agreement was signed between mr uri tagger the inventor and safecode drug technologies corp for a patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine on december   this agreement granted safecode drug technologies corp exclusive rights title and interest in and to the invention all intellectual property rights free and clear of any lien charge claim preemptive rights etc for the invention we purchased the patentpending technology from the inventor an individual with limited experience in the field of medicinal devices the inventor is engaged in the business of webbased media applications and due to a lack of funds and the risk that a product based on the patent application would not be commercially feasible he has neither developed the technology that is the subject of the patent application nor attempted to commercialize the patent application prior to selling the technology to us a prototype of our proposed product has not yet been manufactured to test the capabilities of the potential product and no testing has yet been performed regarding the ability of the proposed product to perform as expected or regarding the reliability or costeffectiveness of such a product except for having purchased the patent application from the inventor we do not have any relationship with the inventor the safecode drug technologies technology has the potential to be adopted as a standard in all hospitals and care centers for improving the safety of medication administration specifically the invention is intended to match drug name voice templates as a threshold mechanism for unlocking a medication container such as a syringe or pill box this invention is intended to help minimize accidentally administering the wrong medication to a patient by requiring a caregiver such as a doctor or a nurse to verbally announce the name of the medication that should be administered if the medicine does not match the verbal name the medicine cannot be administered the technology was transferred to safecode drug technologies corp by mr uri tagger inventor in exchange for  of future royalties on any income the company may derive from the patent the proposed product based on our invention will focus on the use of voice recognition technology to ensure the right drug  pill vial  box is being opened and administered to the patient it will include both hardware and software components it may include a barcode that identifies the patient for whom the medication is intended a drug identifier a computer readable medium containing a stored template that identifies the drug trade name the compound name etc a processing unit capable of sending the stored voice templates to a computer and a software application hosted on a computer system the computer will have standard equipment such as a motherboard keyboard mouse monitor etc but will also have a microphone capable of receiving voice commands and recording the voice templates against which the voice commands area compared the exact components of the final product will be determined by the manufacturer who licenses the invention from safecode in the event the licensee determines it necessary or beneficial to use a barcode identification system for the patient matching safety feature in addition to the voice recognition component to ensure the right drug is being administered that is integral to our technology offering the manufacturer will need to license the rights to patent   from medisafe technology corp the computer should have internet capabilities including an internal modem or a connection to a modem and internet access to enable the program to access a central repository of stored voice templates of drug brand names generic brand names or a combination of both the audio recording program should include voice recognition software for interacting with the microphone and to record the voice templates we intend that the software will be developed by third party contractors other components will either be outsourced or purchased from suppliers of standard computer equipment and configured to work with our software though not considered part of the actual product we envision care centers and hospitals placing our product on a mobile cart that can be moved with the nurses or caregivers as they move from room to room similar to blood pressure machines our device would be taken from room to room to dispense medicine since the software program has not yet been developed it is not yet possible to determine the exact nature of how the protection system will work in its final development or to determine the costs involved in developing the product a voice detection microchip system will be included such that the caregiver will be required to state the name of the medication being administered to be matched against stored voice recognition templates within the program this system will include a microchip sensor with voice recognition software and an electromagnetic locking device that will interface with the microchip sensor to use our proposed product the care provider will be required to read aloud the name of the patient and the name of the medicine upon a match of the patient name with the correct medicine the microchip sensor will send an electronic alert to the electromagnetic locking device to unlock the storage container since different drugs would need to be stored in their own locked containers each medication would need to be stored in a separate locked drug container connected to the microchip sensor and electromagnetic locking device one disadvantage of our product is that it is not intended for emergency situations in which medications must be administered without delay firm instructions not to use this product in emergency situations will be included because our product is not intended for use in such an environment both because of the time factor and because of additional pressures on staff at such times while there is always an element of human error when dealing with a system requiring human interaction we intend for safety mechanisms to be included in the software for example we intend for the product to include confirmation screens that will require the human operator to confirm stages within the operation and voice assignments one of the criteria for finding a proper third party partner will be whether it has prior experience in developing software for the medical industry since the goal of the product is to help avoid error the important element of the software will be the inclusion of safety factors to confirm that the correct medicine is being opened the design and development of a commercial product will be carried out by  rd party partners who agree to license the design and pay a portion of future royalties to maintain the license on an ongoing basis our ideal third party partner will have extensive experience in software development in the medical industry in general and in the drug industry in particular we plan to initially promote our technology to drug manufacturers of the top  drug manufacturers almost half are located in the united states with others located in europe asia and israel source on november   the company entered into a license agreement with medisafe  technologies corp a delaware corporation and a public reporting company engaged in the development of medical technology products pursuant to the license agreement safecode as licensee has been granted a non  exclusive perpetual license to manufacture market and otherwise commercially exploit worldwide medisafes patented device for administering medicine in correct dosages

agent is responsible for all recordkeeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock plan of operation we are a development stage company that has acquired a patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine we do not have any plans to manufacture or develop our product rather we plan to license the patentpending technology to one or more third party partners who will be responsible for designing developing manufacturing and selling their product branded with their corporate identity as they determine best fits their sales program in exchange for this licensing agreement the partner or partners will agree to pay to safecode drug technologies corp an upfront fee and royalties on an ongoing basis to accomplish this we plan to engage in a determined marketing and promotional campaign to identify and target potential partners for this purpose we plan preparatory stage  months includes the development of marketing materials about the design patent the potential benefits and market identify target partners  month we anticipate this stage will take approximately  month as we believe it best to create a detailed priority list rather than simply target one company at a time we will analyze the benefits of each company as potential partners measured against the efforts we believe we can expect them to take and confirm we are prepared to approach and negotiate with such partners we may need to hire third party business consultants for this purpose or our directors and officers may undertake this effort marketing to potential  rd party partners  months this will involve hiring marketing consultants and strategists to contact potential development partners and negotiate licensing agreements with them we are open to signing many agreements in noncompeting geographical areas or to signing more global crossarea agreements to cover many regions at once we anticipate this could take up to  months but may take longer or shorter depending on the efforts of the marketing team the company in q  raised gross proceeds of  and is currently seeking currently to identify target partners and also seeking companies to manufacture a prototype of the patent pending technology the company has concurrently entered into an agreement with a us  israeli marketing consulting co called strategic marketing technologies corp whereby they will assist safecode drug technologies corp to conceptualize and manufacture a prototype of its patent pending medical product for a demonstration and the possible market penetration into the us department of defense the project is estimated to be completed over a period of  months and will cost  payable in milestones over the related period on

corporate background   we were incorporated in delaware on november   and are a development stage company on december   we entered into an exclusive assignment agreement with mr uri tagger inventor in relation to a patentpending invention for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine the assigned technology has the potential to be adopted as a standard in all hospitals and care centers for improving the safety of medication administration specifically the invention is intended to match drug name voice templates as a threshold mechanism for unlocking a medication container such as a syringe or pill box this invention is intended to help minimize accidentally administering the wrong medication to a patient by requiring a caregiver such as a doctor or a nurse to verbally announce the name of the medication that should be administered if the medicine does not match the verbally announced name of the medication the medicine cannot be administered   the patentpending technology was transferred to safecode drug technologies corp by mr uri tagger inventor in exchange  for a commitment to pay  of future royalties on any revenues we may derive from the patent this agreement was executed on december     the assigned patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine is intended to feature several components including a drug name identifier a computer readable medium containing a stored template that identifies the drug trade name the compound name etc a processing unit capable of sending the stored voice templates to a computer and  a software application hosted on a computer system the computer will have standard equipment such as a motherboard keyboard mouse monitor etc but also have a microphone capable of receiving voice commands and recording the voice templates against which the voice commands are compared   the computer to be used with the technology will be required to have internet capabilities including an internal modem or a connection to a modem and internet access to enable the program to access a central repository of stored voice templates of drug brand names generic brand names or a combination of both the audio recording program should include voice recognition software for interacting with the microphone and to record the voice templates   we have not yet developed our proposed product and we have not yet obtained objective evidence that our invention can reliably perform the functions described above   we plan to license the patent to a thirdparty to design manufacture and market the device against an initial payment to us and a percentage licensing agreement to be paid quarterly      the company commenced a capital formation activity by filing a registration statement on form s to the sec to register and sell in a selfdirected offering  shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of  per share for proceeds of up to  the registration statement was declared effective on december   on march   the company issued  shares of common stock pursuant to the registration statement on form s for proceeds of  the offering costs of  related to this capital formation activity were charged against the capital raised        business summary   we were incorporated in delaware on november   and are a development stage company an assignment agreement was signed between mr uri tagger the inventor and safecode drug technologies corp for a patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine on december   this agreement granted safecode drug technologies corp exclusive rights title and interest in and to the invention all intellectual property rights free and clear of any lien charge claim preemptive rights etc for the invention   we purchased the patentpending technology from the inventor an individual with limited experience in the field of medicinal devices  the inventor is engaged in the business of webbased media applications and due to a lack of funds and the risk that a product based on the patent application would not be commercially feasible he has neither developed the technology that is the subject of the patent application nor attempted to commercialize the patent application prior to selling the technology to us  a prototype of our proposed product has not yet been manufactured to test the capabilities of the potential product and no testing has yet been performed regarding the ability of the proposed product to perform as expected or regarding the reliability or costeffectiveness of such a product  except for having purchased the patent application from the inventor we do not have any relationship with the inventor   the safecode drug technologies technology has the potential to be adopted as a standard in all hospitals and care centers for improving the safety of medication administration specifically the invention is intended to match drug name voice templates as a threshold mechanism for unlocking a medication container such as a syringe or pill box this invention is intended to help minimize accidentally administering the wrong medication to a patient by requiring a caregiver such as a doctor or a nurse to verbally announce the name of the medication that should be administered if the medicine does not match the verbal name the medicine cannot be administered   the technology was transferred to safecode drug technologies corp by mr uri tagger inventor in exchange for  of future royalties on any income the company may derive from the patent   the proposed product based on our invention will focus on the use of voice recognition technology to ensure the right drug  pill vial  box is being opened and administered to the patient it will include both hardware and software components it may include a barcode that identifies the patient for whom the medication is intended a drug identifier a computer readable medium containing a stored template that identifies the drug trade name the compound name etc a processing unit capable of sending the stored voice templates to a computer and a software application hosted on a computer system the computer will have standard equipment such as a motherboard keyboard mouse monitor etc but will also have a microphone capable of receiving voice commands and recording the voice templates against which the voice commands area compared the exact components of the final product will be determined by the manufacturer who licenses the invention from safecode in the event the licensee determines it necessary or beneficial to use a barcode identification system for the patient matching safety feature in addition to the voice recognition component to ensure the right drug is being administered that is integral to our technology offering the manufacturer will need to license the rights to patent   from medisafe technology corp   the computer should have internet capabilities including an internal modem or a connection to a modem and internet access to enable the program to access a central repository of stored voice templates of drug brand names generic brand names or a combination of both the audio recording program should include voice recognition software for interacting with the microphone and to record the voice templates   we intend that the software will be developed by third party contractors  other components will either be outsourced or purchased from suppliers of standard computer equipment and configured to work with our software   though not considered part of the actual product we envision care centers and hospitals placing our product on a mobile cart that can be moved with the nurses or caregivers as they move from room to room similar to blood pressure machines our device would be taken from room to room to dispense medicine   since the software program has not yet been developed it is not yet possible to determine the exact nature of how the protection system will work in its final development or to determine the costs involved in developing the product  a voice detection microchip system will be included such that the caregiver will be required to state the name of the medication being administered to be matched against stored voice recognition templates within the program   this system will include a microchip sensor with voice recognition software and an electromagnetic locking device that will interface with the microchip sensor  to use our proposed product the care provider will be required to read aloud the name of the patient and the name of the medicine  upon a match of the patient name with the correct medicine the microchip sensor will send an electronic alert to the electromagnetic locking device to unlock the storage container   since different drugs would need to be stored in their own locked containers each medication would need to be stored in a separate locked drug container connected to the microchip sensor and electromagnetic locking device        one disadvantage of our product is that it is not intended for emergency situations in which medications must be administered without delay  firm instructions not to use this product in emergency situations will be included because our product is not intended for use in such an environment both because of the time factor and because of additional pressures on staff at such times   while there is always an element of human error when dealing with a system requiring human interaction we intend for safety mechanisms to be included in the software  for example we intend for the product to include confirmation screens that will require the human operator to confirm stages within the operation and voice assignments   one of the criteria for finding a proper third party partner will be whether it has prior experience in developing software for the medical industry   since the goal of the product is to help avoid error the important element of the software will be the inclusion of safety factors to confirm that the correct medicine is being opened   the design and development of a commercial product will be carried out by  rd party partners who agree to license the design and pay a portion of future royalties to maintain the license on an ongoing basis   our ideal third party partner will have extensive experience in software development in the medical industry in general and in the drug industry in particular  we plan to initially promote our technology to drug manufacturers  of the top  drug manufacturers almost half are located in the united states with others located in europe asia and israel  source wikipedia  as our directors are located in israel we will also approach top israeli drug manufacturers in an attempt to partner with them and license our technology to them  we also intend to look to leaders in the field of computerized decision support systems cdss as potential partners  beyond pharmaceutical companies it is possible that insurance companies may be interested in partnering with our technology to provide valueadded services to their clients by utilizing products such as ours that reduce the risk of malpractice   we have not generated any revenues to date and our operations have been limited to organizational startup and capital formation activities we currently have two employees other than our

a patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine we do not have any plans to manufacture or develop our product rather we plan to license the patentpending technology to one or more third party partners who will be responsible for designing developing manufacturing and selling their product branded with their corporate identity as they determine best fits their sales program in exchange for this licensing agreement the partner or partners will agree to pay to safecode drug technologies corp an upfront fee and royalties on an ongoing basis   to accomplish this we plan to engage in a determined marketing and promotional campaign to identify and target potential partners for this purpose we plan   preparatory stage  months includes the development of marketing materials about the design patent the potential benefits and market   identify target partners  month we anticipate this stage will take approximately  month as we believe it best to create a detailed priority list rather than simply target one company at a time we will analyze the benefits of each company as potential partners measured against the efforts we believe we can expect them to take and confirm we are prepared to approach and negotiate with such partners we may need to hire third party business consultants for this purpose or our directors and officers may undertake this effort   marketing to potential  rd party partners  months this will involve hiring marketing consultants and strategists to contact potential development partners and negotiate licensing agreements with them we are open to signing many agreements in noncompeting geographical areas or to signing more global crossarea agreements to cover many regions at once we anticipate this could take up to  months but may take longer or shorter depending on the efforts of the marketing team   thirdparty manufacturers   we will rely on third parties to design develop manufacture and market a product based on our patentpending invention for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine we do not have any plans to manufacture or develop our product rather we plan to license the patentpending technology to one or more third party partners who will be responsible for designing developing manufacturing and selling their product branded with their corporate identity as they determine best fits their sales program   in exchange for this licensing agreement the partner or partners will agree to pay to safecode drug technologies corp an upfront fee and royalties on an ongoing basis   we have signed an agreement with intovision an israeli technology development co to design a prototype of the patent pending technology this is expected to take approximately  months    intellectual property   on december   we signed an assignment agreement with mr uri tagger in relation to a patentpending voiceenabled protector for administering medicine as part of this agreement safecode drug technologies corp was given all right title and interest for the united states territories and possessions and for all other countries in the world in relation to a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine  the proprietary technology consists of an the invention regarding how to combine and integrate software and hardware to provide protection against administering incorrect medicine through voice recognition whereby the medicine or medicinal fluid will not be able to be extracted from its container without human voice recognition that identifies and matches the name of the medicine with the name of the patient   the invention that we purchased is described in a patent application that was filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto in december  under patent application serial number   we estimate that approximately  year will elapse before the uspto will send us its first set of comments on the application  it may take approximately  years before a patent will be issued on the application and any issued patent would expire  years from the date of issuance   competition   while there are many medical dispensers on the market we have not found any that offer the same benefits as the safecode drug technologies corp invention for example patents wirtschafter us pat no  albeck us pat no  and walters us pat no  all incorporate the timing mechanisms and alarms in the cap or lid of the medication bottle or container itself to help prevent a patient from taking medication at the wrong time however these patents to not protect the patient from a medical caregiver administering the wrong medication         our proposed product differs from the technology owned by medisafe  technologies corp in that in medisafes product the locking device on the container holding the medicinal substance has a bar code and a bar code is also attached to the patient who is to receive the medicine  a bar code reader then reads and matches the two bar codes and then the locking device is unlocked upon the two bar codes matching one another  our proposed product in addition to the use of bar codes a preset voice detection microchip is used on the locking device  the microchip contains the name of the medicine and a human voice has to pronounce the name of the medicine  in the event of a match the locking device is released to ensure the correct medicine is opened   this voice recognition procedure is a procedure to ensure the right medicine drug is being opened prior to them ensuring administration to the correct patient   the company does not have any relationship with medisafe  technologies corp   a key element of our technology is the software application that stores template patterns for medicines and matches these templates to drug names used by caregivers such as doctors and nurses because we do not plan to design and manufacture a product based on our patentpending invention we cannot fully determine how the product will appear we intend for these aspects  to be handled by the rd party partner or partners who license our technology        patent trademark license  franchise restrictions   contractual obligations  concessions   as described above we have entered into an assignment agreement with mr uri tagger the inventor of a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine in exchange for  of future royalties on any revenue the company may derive from the patent according to this agreement we acquired full rights to all title and interest related to a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine this agreement was signed on december   no other trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts are in effect regarding this prospectus   we plan to develop a website related to our invention which we intend to use to promote advertise and potentially market our patent to  rd party partners interested in developing manufacturing and marketing our voiceenabled protector for administering medicine the site will be for information and promotion only not for direct sales as we intend to license the development manufacturing and marketing to these  rd party partners in exchange for an upfront payment and ongoing royalties we intend to fully protect our voiceenabled protector for administering medicine design with copyright and trade secrecy laws   liquidity and capital resources   as of december   we had   in current marketable securities  we incurred a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with a net loss of   for the period ending december   the increase in the  net loss is applicable to impairment expenses in the amount of  relating to the technology acquired from medisafe   our cumulative net loss since inception is  which is comprised entirely of general and administrative expenses and the impairment expense of    the company has raised  in gross proceeds subsequent to december   pursuant to the effective s declared effective by the sec on december   and has sufficient funds for the next twelve months to cover its operating expenses however  there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the company the company currently has no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans lines of credit or any other sources since the company has no such arrangements or plans currently in effect its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on its ability to remain a viable company        lack of insurance   the company currently has no insurance in force for its office facilities and operations and it cannot be certain that it can cover the risks associated with such lack of insurance or that it will be able to obtain andor maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums   going concern consideration   the company has raised gross proceeds of  pursuant to the effective s registration statement and has enough funds for its operations for the next twelve months however thereafter if the company will not commence to generate revenues then it will need to raise additional equity thru the issuance of debt or equity securities    recently issued accounting pronouncements   in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no  fasb

hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles”  sfas no  fasb asc  is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework or hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for nongovernmental entities   prior to the issuance of sfas no  fasb asc  gaap hierarchy was defined in the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement on auditing standards “sas” no  “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accept accounting principles”  sas no  has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  sfas no  fasb asc  addresses these issues by establishing that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not the auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap   the sources of accounting principles that are generally accepted are categorized in descending order as follows     a fasb statements of financial accounting standards and interpretations fasb statement  implementation issues fasb staff positions and american institute of certified public accountants aicpa accounting research bulletins and accounting principles board

  safecode drug technologies corp “safecode” or the “company” is a delaware corporation in the development stage and has not commenced operations the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on november   the business plan of the company is to license a commercial application of a voice enabled protector for administering medicine to third party entities interested in licensing the rights to manufacture and market the device the accompanying financial statements of the company were prepared from the accounts of the company under the accrual basis of accounting   cash and cash equivalents     for purposes of reporting within the statement of cash flows the company considers all cash on hand cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents   revenue recognition   the company is in the development stage and has yet to realize revenues from operations once the company has commenced operations it will recognize revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement acceptance has been approved by its customers the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions and collection of any related receivable is probable   loss per common share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive there were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended december     income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes the deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences   the company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets the company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the company’s financial position and results of operations for the current period future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the federal tax laws   changes in circumstances such as the company generating taxable income could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate   f       fair value of financial instruments   financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means   level   inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   the company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and valuation methods considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value accordingly the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange   as of december  marketable securities were valued at  based on level  inputs   as of december   and  the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value approximated fair value due to the shortterm nature and maturity of these instruments   deferred offering costs   the company defers as other assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital until such time as the offering is completed if the offering is successful these costs will be charged against the proceeds if the offering is unsuccessful these costs will be expensed   impairment of longlived assets   the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets and the related estimated remaining lives when events or circumstances lead management to believe that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable   estimates   the financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of december   and expenses for the period ended december   and cumulative from inception actual results could differ from those estimates made by management   f       fiscal year end   the company has adopted a

disclosure   none   item at   controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule ae under the securities exchange act of  that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and internal accounting officer  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of december   we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our ceo and internal accounting officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on this evaluation our ceo and internal accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective   management does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management or board override of the control   the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   managements report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys ceo and internal accounting officer and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that      pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and           provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   as of december   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were effective

established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert nor has the board established a nominating committee the board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the company has only two directors and to date such directors have been performing the functions of such committees thus there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation nominations and audit issues that may affect management decisions we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors   involvement in certain legal proceedings   there are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past five years concerning our

january   prnewswire  safecode drug technologies corp otcbb safc a developer of a patentpending voice recognition technology that reduces the risks of errors during the administration of prescription medications has signed an agreement with intovision product development  design  to manufacturers the worlds first voice recognition drug safety application  prototype the development is expected to take  months at which time it will be demonstrated to the worlds leading drug and drug container manufacturers a video demonstration of the product applications can be viewed at httpyoutubepeyygtjaa safecode is the developer of the worlds first patentprotected voice recognition technology used to confirm prescription medications prior to their administration at home or in a medical center   using safecode technology prescription medications stored in specially designed locked containers can only be accessed and administered once the caregiver or patient correctly announces the name of the drug the technology ensures that the appropriate medication is being administered as mistakes have accounted for thousands of deaths in recent years  often nurses doctors or patients are not careful when giving or taking medications and much medications packaging may look similar safecode technology prevents medication errors and thereby reduces the risk of severe injury or accidental death we are hopeful that a contract with a manufacturer will be signed in the coming weeks enabling us to build our first product prototype said joel klopfer chief executive officer of safecode drug technologies  there is a large addressable market for this technology due to the thousands of deaths each year related to medication errors about safecode drug technologies safecode drug technologies is the

price of  per share will vary depending upon the total number of shares sold regardless of the number of shares sold we expect to incur offering expenses estimated at approximately  consisting of  for legal accounting incurred and  of other costs in connection with this offering estimated transfer agent fees the table below shows the intended net proceeds from this offering we expect to receive for scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares since we are making this offering without any minimum requirement there is no guarantee that we will be successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus accordingly the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this offering if any may differ none of the proceeds from this offering will be used to pay the salaries or make other payments to our officers and directors in relation to outstanding loans to the company percent of net proceeds received     shares sold     gross proceeds         less offering

existing liabilities      total       our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses and transfer agent fees relating to the offering our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our shares we intend to use the proceeds of this offering in the manner and in order of priority set forth above we do not intend to use the proceeds to acquire assets or finance the acquisition of other businesses at present no material changes are contemplated should there be any material changes in the projected use of proceeds in connection with this offering we will issue an amended prospectus reflecting the new uses in all instances after the effectiveness of this registration statement the company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general existence and comply with its public reporting obligations our company estimates that we will need approximately an additional  per year to cover additional expenses for public reporting legal fees accounting auditing and transfer of agent fees the company recognizes that if it does not raise net proceeds of at least  in this offering it will have to seek additional funds to cover these expenses the  in net proceeds that we need to stay in business for twelve months is comprised of i  for existing liabilities ii  for promotional and marketing expenses to locate and contract with one or more third party licensees and iii  for sec reporting expenses while the existing liabilities on our balance sheet also include  in shareholder loans and  in deferred offering costs the shareholders loans do not have a fixed repayment date and the deferred offering costs will be paid out of the gross proceeds from the offering the net proceeds from the offering will not be used to pay either of these liabilities in addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business plan investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds therefore management decisions may not be in line with the initial objectives of investors who will have little ability to influence these decisions while there are many medical dispensers on the market we have not found any that offer the same benefits as the safecode drug technologies corp invention for example patents wirtschafter us pat no  albeck us pat no  and walters us pat no  all incorporate the timing mechanisms and alarms in the cap or lid of the medication bottle or container itself to help prevent a patient from taking medication at the wrong time however these patents to not protect the patient from a medical caregiver administering the wrong medication our proposed product differs from the technology owned by medisafe  technologies corp in that in medisafes product the locking device on the container holding the medicinal substance has a bar code and a bar code is also attached to the patient who is to receive the medicine a bar code reader then reads and matches the two bar codes and then the locking device is unlocked upon the two bar codes matching one another our proposed product in addition to the use of bar codes a preset voice detection microchip is used on the locking device the microchip contains the name of the medicine and a human voice has to pronounce the name of the medicine in the event of a match the locking device is released to ensure the correct medicine is opened this voice recognition procedure is a procedure to ensure the right medicine drug is being opened prior to them ensuring administration to the correct patient the company does not have any relationship with medisafe  technologies corp a key element of our technology is the software application that stores template patterns for medicines and matches these templates to drug names used by caregivers such as doctors and nurses because we do not plan to design and manufacture a product based on our patentpending invention we cannot fully determine how the product will appear we intend for these aspects to be handled by the  rd party partner or partners who license our technology company description we were incorporated in delaware on november   and are a development stage company on december   we entered into an exclusive assignment agreement with mr uri tagger inventor in relation to a patentpending invention for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine the assigned technology has the potential to be adopted as a standard in all hospitals and care centers for improving the safety of medication administration specifically the invention is intended to match drug name voice templates as a threshold mechanism for unlocking a medication container such as a syringe or pill box this invention is intended to help minimize accidentally administering the wrong medication to a patient by requiring a caregiver such as a doctor or a nurse to verbally announce the name of the medication that should be administered if the medicine does not match the verbally announced name of the medication the medicine cannot be administered the patentpending technology was transferred to safecode drug technologies corp by mr uri tagger inventor in exchange for a commitment to pay  of future royalties on any revenues we may derive from the patent this agreement was executed on december   the assigned patentpending technology for a voiceenabled protector for administering medicine is intended to feature several components including a drug name identifier a computer readable medium containing a stored template that identifies the drug trade name the compound name etc a processing unit capable of sending the stored voice templates to a computer and a software application hosted on a computer system the computer will have standard equipment such as a motherboard keyboard mouse monitor etc but also have a microphone capable of receiving voice commands and recording the voice templates against which the voice commands are compared the computer to be used with the technology will be required to have internet capabilities including an internal modem or a connection to a modem and internet access to enable the program to access a central repository of stored voice templates of drug brand names generic brand names or a combination of both the audio recording program should include voice recognition software for interacting with the microphone and to record the voice templates we have not yet developed our proposed product and we have not yet obtained objective evidence that our invention can reliably perform the functions described above we plan to license the patent to a thirdparty to design manufacture and market the device against an initial payment to us and a percentage licensing agreement to be paid quarterly our principal offices are located at  meever hamiltah street  jerusalem  israel our
