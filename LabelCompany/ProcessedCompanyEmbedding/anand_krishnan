offered by doctors who go through a very well structured and trained mbbs course at medical colleges of course it is this category of medicine that all of us also get from our neighbourhood hospitals and clinics so we naturally tend to think that “this is the only” form of medicine we can all agree there is no substitute for allopathic western medicine when it comes to emergency medical care however “allopathic care” is “just one alternative” for preventive medicine or assessment care there are important alternatives to western or allopathy medicine · these alternative medicines like  naturopathy  homeopathy  ayurvedic  traditional chinese medicine including acupuncture   malay traditional medicine are among the most sought after treatment options in most parts of the civilized

years into the future as the first concept suv to roll out of the tata motors hangar a bold new direction was sought out to showcase the vehicle by seeking inspiration in art and architecture the entire programme was structured around a timeline that spanned four months the initial period of which was marked with random explorations based on the premise of what comprises a concept car an incremental understanding of design with the hope of identifying a language for the vehicle formed the basis for the explorations the concepts were categorised into themes such as modern conceptual avantgarde etc a greater percentage of time was dedicated to the exploratory stage setting a solid foundation of ideas based on which the final concept drew essence the new vehicle interior embodied futuristic overtones biodynamic form language and crossover traits the brief at this point was reexplored and the premises were further strengthened to develop the final concept with vehicular
