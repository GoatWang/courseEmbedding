years between world war ii and the persian gulf war pollack is married to the wellknown television journalist andrea koppel the daughter of ted koppel advocacy of iraq invasionedit in his second book the threatening storm the case for invading iraq pub  pollack details the history of united states actions against iraq since the persian gulf war of  he says that the united states should invade iraq and describes ways of going about it pollack argued that saddam hussein was simply too volatile and aggressive in his policies to be trusted not to begin another conflict in a volatile region in the threatening storm pollack argued the only prudent and realistic course of action left to the united states is to mount a fullscale invasion of iraq to smash the iraqi armed forces depose saddam’s regime and rid the country of weapons of mass destruction” pollack predicted “it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars” likewise he wrote “we should not exaggerate the danger of casualties among american troops us forces in bosnia have not suffered a single casualty from hostile action because they have become so attentive and skillful at force protection” pollack is credited with persuading liberals of the case for the iraq war new york times columnist bill keller in supporting the iraq war in  wrote “kenneth pollack the clinton national security council expert whose argument for invading iraq is surely the most influential book of this season has provided intellectual cover for every liberal who finds himself inclining toward war but uneasy about mr bush” liberal writer matthew yglesias in the la times also attested to pollack’s influence of course those of us who read pollacks celebrated  book the threatening storm the case for invading iraq and became convinced as a result that the united states needed to well invade iraq in order to dismantle saddam husseins advanced nuclear weapons program the one he didnt actually have might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to our betters  many have criticized his support for the invasion of iraq including middle east correspondent robert fisk who called the threatening storm the most meretricious contribution to the prewar debate on military action and included it in the select bibliography section of his  book the great war for civilisation in order to show just how specific – and misleading – were the efforts to persuade americans to invade many critics as well as many of those who used the book to justify their support of the invasion overlooked the more balanced presentation on the pros and cons of war to be found in the threatening storm as chris suellentrop of slate pointed out before the invasion on march   six months after the threatening storms publication however pollacks book reads as much like an indictment of the bush administrations overeagerness to go to war as it does an endorsement of it a more appropriate subtitle for the book would have been the case for rebuilding afghanistan destroying alqaida setting israel and palestine on the road to peace and then a year or two down the road after some diplomacy invading iraq in interviews and oped articles pollack himself still supports the war saying that now is better than never but its fair to say that his book does not—or at least not bushs path to it pollack responded to the suellentrop article by saying that he was unhappy that many people seemed to have read only the subtitle of his book which had not been his choice he also said given how far down the road the bush administration has taken us i think that we have no realistic choice but to go to war this year and yet i think the administration has handled the diplomacy and public diplomacy of coalition building very poorly and i am deeply concerned about the impact this will have both on postwar reconstruction and on our ability to garner allies for the inevitable next crisis  pollack later was a strong supporter of the iraq war troop surge of  advocated by general david petraeus which entailed a buildup of us ground forces to improve the security of the iraqi population and help iraq increase its governmental capacity develop employment programs and improve daily life for its citizens he laid out some of his arguments in support of the surge in the june  ny times article a war we just might win which was coauthored with michael e ohanlon of brookings  other publicationsedit in  his third book the persian puzzle was published in contrast to his views on iraq in the persian puzzle he argued that though the threat of force is necessary in dealing with iran diplomacy rather than regime change by force is the best way of dealing with iran because irans policymakers are divided between pragmatists who are motivated by a desire to improve the economy and hardliners who fear us attack and so seek a nuclear deterrent  the united states can thus exploit this divide to negotiate a favourable agreement he also argued that the hardliners leader supreme leader ali khamenei was unlike saddam hussein rational and riskaverse and so even if iran did acquire a nuclear capability iran could be deterred in a way that saddam hussein could not be in  pollack coauthored the book things fall apart containing the spillover from an iraqi civil war with daniel l byman this book analyzed  recent civil wars to derive six common ways in which fullscale ethnic civil wars spillover to affect neighboring states pollack and byman argued that while spillover can range from modest effects to very severe problems like causing other civil wars or triggering regional wars among neighboring states that the early evidence so far suggested that the united states should be prepared for iraqs potential descent into allout civil war to be on the worse end of the spectrum the book went on to lay out thirteen different ways that the united states and its allies might fashion a containment strategy for iraq which offered some chance of preventing allout civil war in iraq from destabilizing the wider persian gulf region in the event that american efforts to stabilize the country failed while pollack and byman argued that such a containment strategy would be very difficult to make work given the historical problems of doing so and the specific problems created by previous american actions in iraq they also concluded that containment would likely prove americas least bad option because us interests in the persian gulf were so important that washington would have to try to mitigate the impact of spillover he has written numerous articles for publications such as the atlantic monthly and foreign affairs he has also repeatedly testified before the senate foreign relations committee he currently teaches security problems of the middle east  persian gulf and military analysis at georgetowns school of foreign service pollacks fifth book a path out of the desert a grand strategy for america in the middle east was published in july  in a review in army magazine former commander of multinational security transition commandiraq ltg james m dubik us army retired described the book as providing a clear description of america’s vital interests in the middle east and presenting welldocumented cogent arguments on the threats posed by the regional anger and frustration bred by crippling societal problems pollack recommends a grand strategy for the united states and its allies in which they encourage and enable the countries of the middle east to pursue a gradual process of political economic and social reform—one that grows from within rather than being imposed from without one that reflects the values traditions history and aspirations of the people of the region themselves not a western guess at them one that

biographyedit born to a jewish family pollack obtained a ba from yale university in  and went on to earn a phd from mit in  he has served in a variety of roles in government from  until  he was an analyst on iraqi and iranian military issues for the central intelligence agency he spent a year as director for near east and south asian affairs with the united states national security council in  he rejoined the nsc as the director for persian gulf affairs he also served two stints as a professor with the national defense university outside of government he worked for the brookings institution as the director of research at its saban center for middle east policy he previously worked for the council of foreign relations as their director of national security studies he has also written four books the first two of which were published in  his first monograph arabs at war examined the foreign policy of six arab nations in the years between world war ii and the persian gulf war pollack is married to the wellknown television journalist andrea koppel the daughter of ted koppel advocacy of iraq invasionedit in his second book the threatening storm the case for invading iraq pub  pollack details the history of united states actions against iraq since the persian gulf war of  he says that the united states should invade iraq and describes ways of going about it pollack argued that saddam hussein was simply too volatile and aggressive in his policies to be trusted not to begin another conflict in a volatile region in the threatening storm pollack argued the only prudent and realistic course of action left to the united states is to mount a fullscale invasion of iraq to smash the iraqi armed forces depose saddam’s regime and rid the country of weapons of mass destruction” pollack predicted “it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars” likewise he wrote “we should not exaggerate the danger of casualties among american troops us forces in bosnia have not suffered a single casualty from hostile action because they have become so attentive and skillful at force protection” pollack is credited with persuading liberals of the case for the iraq war new york times columnist bill keller in supporting the iraq war in  wrote “kenneth pollack the clinton national security council expert whose argument for invading iraq is surely the most influential book of this season has provided intellectual cover for every liberal who finds himself inclining toward war but uneasy about mr bush” liberal writer matthew yglesias in the la times also attested to pollack’s influence of course those of us who read pollacks celebrated  book the threatening storm the case for invading iraq and became convinced as a result that the united states needed to well invade iraq in order to dismantle saddam husseins advanced nuclear weapons program the one he didnt actually have might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to our betters  many have criticized his support for the invasion of iraq including middle east correspondent robert fisk who called the threatening storm the most meretricious contribution to the prewar debate on military action and included it in the select bibliography section of his  book the great war for civilisation in order to show just how specific – and misleading – were the efforts to persuade americans to invade many critics as well as many of those who used the book to justify their support of the invasion overlooked the more balanced presentation on the pros and cons of war to be found in the threatening storm as chris suellentrop of slate pointed out before the invasion on march   six months after the threatening storms publication however pollacks book reads as much like an indictment of the bush administrations overeagerness to go to war as it does an endorsement of it a more appropriate subtitle for the book would have been the case for rebuilding afghanistan destroying alqaida setting israel and palestine on the road to peace and then a year or two down the road after some diplomacy invading iraq in interviews and oped articles pollack himself still supports the war saying that now is better than never but its fair to say that his book does not—or at least not bushs path to it pollack responded to the suellentrop article by saying that he was unhappy that many people seemed to have read only the subtitle of his book which had not been his choice he also said given how far down the road the bush administration has taken us i think that we have no realistic choice but to go to war this year and yet i think the administration has handled the diplomacy and public diplomacy of coalition building very poorly and i am deeply concerned about the impact this will have both on postwar reconstruction and on our ability to garner allies for the inevitable next crisis  pollack later was a strong supporter of the iraq war troop surge of  advocated by general david petraeus which entailed a buildup of us ground forces to improve the security of the iraqi population and help iraq increase its governmental capacity develop employment programs and improve daily life for its citizens he laid out some of his arguments in support of the surge in the june  ny times article a war we just might win which was coauthored with michael e ohanlon of brookings  other publicationsedit in  his third book the persian puzzle was published in contrast to his views on iraq in the persian puzzle he argued that though the threat of force is necessary in dealing with iran diplomacy rather than regime change by force is the best way of dealing with iran because irans policymakers are divided between pragmatists who are motivated by a desire to improve the economy and hardliners who fear us attack and so seek a nuclear deterrent  the united states can thus exploit this divide to negotiate a favourable agreement he also argued that the hardliners leader supreme leader ali khamenei was unlike saddam hussein rational and riskaverse and so even if iran did acquire a nuclear capability iran could be deterred in a way that saddam hussein could not be in  pollack coauthored the book things fall apart containing the spillover from an iraqi civil war with daniel l byman this book analyzed  recent civil wars to derive six common ways in which fullscale ethnic civil wars spillover to affect neighboring states pollack and byman argued that while spillover can range from modest effects to very severe problems like causing other civil wars or triggering regional wars among neighboring states that the early evidence so far suggested that the united states should be prepared for iraqs potential descent into allout civil war to be on the worse end of the spectrum the book went on to lay out thirteen different ways that the united states and its allies might fashion a containment strategy for iraq which offered some chance of preventing allout civil war in iraq from destabilizing the wider persian gulf region in the event that american efforts to stabilize the country failed while pollack and byman argued that such a containment strategy would be very difficult to make work given the historical problems of doing so and the specific problems created by previous american actions in iraq they also concluded that containment would likely prove americas least bad option because us interests in the persian gulf were so important that washington would have to try to mitigate the impact of spillover he has written numerous articles for publications such as the atlantic monthly and foreign affairs he has also repeatedly testified before the senate foreign relations committee he currently teaches security problems of the middle east  persian gulf and military analysis at georgetowns school of foreign service pollacks fifth book a path out of the desert a grand strategy for america in the middle east was published in july  in a review in army magazine former commander of multinational security transition commandiraq ltg james m dubik us army retired described the book as providing a clear description of america’s vital interests in the middle east and presenting welldocumented cogent arguments on the threats posed by the regional anger and frustration bred by crippling societal problems pollack recommends a grand strategy for the united states and its allies in which they encourage and enable the countries of the middle east to pursue a gradual process of political economic and social reform—one that grows from within rather than being imposed from without one that reflects the values traditions history and aspirations of the people of the region themselves not a western guess at them one that recognizes that reform and stability are not mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing—and ultimately mutually
