advanced blues guitarist when i purchased the dickey betts dvd’s so therefore i already had a good library of chords and knowledge of the notes on the fretboard these lessons put the major and minor lead chord progressions in an easy to remember format especially linking the major patterns through the “my girl” pattern where i could not go on the fretboard before i now can fly across the fretboard picking and choosing where i want to go with lead improvisations and its impressive for people to watch and listen john you did good keep up the great work…you are making a difference doug—sc – may  dickey bettsi really enjoy all aspects of the lessons they are well done and easy to understand and follow along i enjoy playing along with the backing tracks all around pleasure and well worth the price flitzefinger—middle of germany göttingen – may  now people say sounds goodgreat course helped me a lot to play like i ever wanted to in this style  thank you very much john warm regards per h—inglewood ca – may  blues guitar method various solos dickey bettsyour instruction is right on and easy to follow which just leaves the physical aspect of the playing to me i can honestly say that i have learned a lot and i am still learning from your dvds so far with the lessons that i have covered i feel pretty good about my blues playing if you have any tips about “raking” please pass them on timh—northern california – june  blue sky dvd great lesson learning a boat load of material it is nice to play major pentatonic like dickey does i have been learning minor pentatonic solo material and this is a nice break i have busted out of the ordinary with this material well presented and john explains everything the course include tab and backing track growth in imminent tim halleran snootermac—the great midwest – june  very helpful and well made this was a very helpful and well made product i like all of john’s lessons jeanmi—la rochelle france – june  good job manbravo john you make a “très bon travail” i am an absolute fan of abb i was in ny in march at the united palace it was great man bravo for stormy monday lesson great solo what about the reed solo fillmore version it will be a good lesson for me thanks you john with your good job now “i feel more” with my guitar salut et à plus tard jeanmichel fillifluran—stockholm sweden – july  the best for an amateuras an music fan ealier i didn´t have the time to learn playing the guitar this dvd the lessons are very good i enjoy every minute of it and i have made more progress than i thought would be possible even my wife learnintheblues—bangalore india – september  dickey betts blue sky stylehey john thanks for the great lesson although i found this dvd to be a little difficult the way you connected every lick to theory everything made sense and i can now improvise decently over a blue sky style major backing track after only a week of practice i would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to add the major scale to their arsenal im now hoping you make a dvd like this on hendrix…… monte—dartmouth ma – december  play like dickey betts blue sky styleawesome lesson that was worth every cent puttydust—highland calif – december  play like dickey bettsi’ve found this video quite good and easy to comprehend in the past i had never really used the mixolydian scale and this lesson has helped me in learning to play with this scale and the backing track is a perfect tool for practicing the use of the mixolydian scale and developing lick of my own thanks jonenew—merrick new york – december  great lessonsjohnthanks for the great lessons you’re easy teaching style blends superb technique with easily digestible theory style and great practical tips my jamming has exponentially changed for the better with the help of your lessons jab—pa – may  dickey betts blue sky stylelike all of john’s dvd’s this one is excellent very thorough and not a “note for note” type lesson format rather it focuses on technique and the approach dickey betts uses in his playing and john has a great teaching style that works for me i have had great results highly recommended also try his blues guitar method mcblues—southeastern pa – september  becoming a more tuneful playerjohn tuggle has obviously taken loads of time to make this contentrich set of lessons do you want to learn dickey betts style licks john takes you through them step by step do you want to learn dickey betts style solos john again takes you through step by step do you want to learn the theory behind why dickey betts’ music sounds the way it does john explains the theory and applies it to the fretboard – again step by step so you can start making your own music in this genre if you pay attention to john’s teaching you will become a more tuneful melodic and interesting guitar player these lessons are worth every penny i would absolutely buy them again – thanks john leif bouffard—mulberry florida – february  so far so goodjohn it’s early yet for a real rating made it thru the natural major’s and i know where my d’s are myxolidian i should be able to figure out the minors right about half way through the solo not as smooth as forest yet probably never will be but i am learning and having funthat’s what it’s all about check back with me later leif hank v—maine – september  dickey bettsi’ve been an allman bros fan since the beginning and a guitar player even longer improvisation is their strength and this series of dvds gets you there in a very logical straight forward fashion it has allowed me to understand the fret board geography and the relation of major and minor scales as it relates to dickey’s playing most importantly i can now be improvisational over all the tunes where as before i sounded like i was trying too hard to do a lame note for note replication best content i have found on this subject mark—germany – november  dickey bettsi just downloaded your dickey betts style lessons and i would like to tell you that i’m blown away by the quality of your stuff i’ve been a stratsrvhendrixstyle player so far and i was just looking for something that could broaden my musical horizon and that would allow me to expand my vocabulary as a musician so i decided to download your dickey betts lessonsi was a bit reluctant at first because the set has certainly its price but i realized instantly that it was worth every cent i spent on it the lessons are pretty fastpaced and a bit challenging so i think that i’ll be working on the allman brothersstuff well into …i think that your lessons are just what the doctor ordered and i’m pretty sure that i’ll purchase your clapton and bb king lessons very soon kind regards from germany mark midrider—yonkers ny – march  play like dickey bettshi johni have had your play like dickey betts course for several months now and would like to say thank you for a great course it does a good job in showing dickey’s soloing approach

a couple of months now and have to say its by far one of the best purchases i have made it has taken my playing to new heights my knowledge of the fretboard and how to relate scales and chords
