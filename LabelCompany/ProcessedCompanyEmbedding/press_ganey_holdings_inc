our initiatives around consumerism and nursing performance breht will wrap up with a detailed review of the financials and our  guidance as i’ve shared with you in the past healthcare continues to experience the most significant transformation that ive seen in my plus years in the industry although this creates some level of disruption as organizations look to redesign care there’s also a period of accelerated innovation that will ultimately advance our industry healthcare systems are seeking strategic partners to help them adopt highreliability practices that will achieve safe highquality care that meets patients’ needs and reduces suffering numerous independent studies over time have reinforced the correlations between safety culture caregiver engagement clinical quality and the patient experience to achieve meaningful and sustainable improvement healthcare systems must align around shared goals to achieve the ideal patient experience across the continuum of care over

organizing performance insights and solutions around what matters most to our clients and the patients they serve press ganey plays a significant role as a partner in improving the overall continuum of care whilst it’s been a busy yeartodate remains a priority of our team to meet with healthcare executives leadership teams and boards of directors across our client organizations to better understand their strategic priorities and to partner to develop innovative programs that drive continued transformation moving to our performance we are pleased to report a solid second quarter  results that we believe demonstrate the continued evolution of our products and our continued thought leadership the key highlights from the second quarter  are as follows strong revenue growth of  and adjusted ebitda growth of  on strong organic revenue growth of  continued strength in revenue retention at  and client retention at  on a rolling threeyear average basis and censusbased survey penetration of  of patient experience revenue excluding the acquired avatar patient experience book of business i’ll remind you the growth in censusbased surveys is based upon the recognition by our client that this rich data gives organizations deeper insights into their systems accelerating innovation improvement and operational sustainability moving onto our corporate development activity the acquisitions of hpi and avatar and our partnership with binary fountain have created solid growth opportunities above and beyond the  to  longterm organic growth rate forecast that we’ve communicated to you in the past our ma and partnership pipelines remain robust we see many opportunities to leverage our size scale and thought leadership to deepen and expand our offerings as always we will maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating our opportunities now i’d like to turn the call over to joe joe joe greskoviak thank you pat overall our associates delivered another solid quarter in addition to the new solutions pat discussed we continue to make investment to enhance our existing product offerings and daytoday operating platform our team continues to do an excellent job of managing our growth the second quarter brought the added challenge of transitioning avatar clients onto the press ganey platform we are encouraged by the early efforts in terms of contracting pricing and the overall onboarding process as well as the receptivity of press ganey solutions by avatar client we were also fortunate to add a great deal of talent through the acquisition while there is still work to be done we believe that we are on track to achieve our integration milestones in the second half  in a moment breht will update our financial guidance around avatar i would like to personally thank the avatar team for their professionalism and all of our associates for their planning and hard work which is driving the very theme transition of avatar clients to the press ganey platform we look forward to working closely with our new clients as we expand our relationships over time our investment in internal product development and our strategic acquisitions over the past several years have positioned our sales team to sale an enterprise solution the enterprise approach has driven our sale success in prior quarters and that momentum has carried into the second quarter across the platform as we look out over the remaining months of the year the sales pipeline remains solid our transparency program and our partnership with binary fountain fit nicely into the overall enterprise strategic approach and has been well received by clients support end to end functionality that enables providers to publish physician star ratings and patient comments on their websites we will continue to work with our clients under transparency journey to protect the integrity of their brands drive greater patient loyalty and improve provider performance at the end of the fourth quarter we will launch our nursing performance solution this product leverages data from multiple press ganey solutions to offer a single source for magnet readiness and reporting requirements and will identify opportunities for our clients to drive nursing excellence adding another important view into the health system it’s early days for both of these products but we will afford to give you an updated guidance when we discuss our thoughts later this year regarding  i will now turn the call over to breht breht feigh thank you joe good morning ill review our financial results for the second quarter today and will focus much of my commentary on the supplemental financial data tables included in the earnings press release issued yesterday these tables provide a detailed explanation and reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to our gaap income statement our second quarter  gaap revenue increased  from  million in  to  million in  revenue growth consisted of  organic growth and  acquisition growth patient experience caregiver engagement and consulting solutions all contributed to the organic revenue growth being above our  to  longterm target organic revenue growth benefited from sales client retention and solid execution of onboarding new patient experience contracts our september  acquisition of healthcare performance improvement contributed  of acquisition growth and our may  acquisition of avatar contributed  of the acquisition growth avatar specifically contributed  million of revenue for the two months of may and june included in avatars results is  million of revenue from organizations that will not continue his client beyond their contractual terms with avatar these organizations include workforce engagement clients that operate outside of the healthcare industry and certain patient experience clients who have given notice of their planned termination prior to our acquisition i will provide guidance around avatar for the remainder of the year later in my comments clients with censusbased surveying excluding avatars patient experience revenue increased to  up from  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of  demonstrating the value and continuing success of this product solution including avatars revenue censusbased surveying was  of patient experience revenue in the quarter as we move forward we will incorporate avatar clients into the calculation for the quarter nongaap cost of revenue increased  from  million in  to  million in  as a percentage of revenue nongaap cost of revenue decreased  basis points to  the improvement was largely driven by leveraging our personnel costs as we continue to witness a greater percentage of electronic surveys for our patient experience solutions for the quarter nongaap general and administrative expense increased  from  million in  to  million in  as a percentage of revenue nongaap general and administrative expense decreased  basis points to  reflecting the leveraging of our general and administrative costs as a result of organic and acquisition revenue growth nongaap depreciation and amortization expense increased  from  million in  to  million in  the  million increase is largely related to our technology investments in our digital platform over the past three years as a result of the items just discussed nongaap income from operations increased  from  million in  to  million in  adjusted ebitda increased  from  million in  to  million in  a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to gaap net income is provided in a separate table in our earnings press release now i’ll review nonoperating expensesearnings interest expense decreased  million from  million in the second quarter of  to  million in this year’s second quarter the decrease in interest expense reflects lower borrowings following the paydown of debt with proceeds from our initial public offering free cash flow generation and a reduction of interest rate as a result of refinancing our debt in july  nongaap provision for taxes was  million for the prior year second and  million for this years second quarter we’ve utilized an effective income tax rate of  in our supplemental financial data which allows for normal run rate nondeductible expenses nongaap net income for the quarter increased  from  million in  to  million in  the adjustments include nonrecurring and noncomparable items detailed in the footnotes to supplemental financial data table along with the addback of amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisition nongaap net income per diluted share for the quarter increased  from  in  to  in  for the reasons just discussed offset by  increase in weighted shares outstanding i’d now like to review cash flow activities cash flow from operations was  million for the second quarter and  million for the six months on a yeartodate basis cash flow from operations increased  or  million as a result of increased profitability including lower cash interest expense as a result of reduced debt outstanding and lower interest rates and an improvement in working capital management net cash used in investing activities was  million for the second quarter and  million for the first six months of  during the quarter we acquired avatar for  million we made an equity investment in binary fountain and had capital expenditures of  million our capital expenditures were almost entirely attributable to capitalized software development costs as we continue to invest in our digital platform adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures of  million represents  of adjusted ebitda and increased  over the prior year quarter next i’d like to review our capital structure we had indebtedness in capitalized leases of  million net of  million of cash a reduction of  million from our yearend  balance of the  million our debt to ebit for bank covenant compliance purposes was  times on a maximum covenant of  times and our  million revolving credit facility was undrawn i’d like to conclude my discussion this morning by commenting on our  outlook in updating our guidance i will discuss the impact of the avatar acquisition separately we are now expecting revenue of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million excluding the impact of the avatar acquisition this revised outlook reflects our strong performance in the first half of  now to comment on the  on avatar for the balance of the year excluding revenue tied to nonhealthcare industry clients and contract terminations known to us we completed the acquisition we estimate that the avatar will contribute approximately  million to  million of patient experience and caregiver engagement revenue from continuing clients during the remainder of  and have no material contribution to  adjusted ebitda as we look to  were making solid progress with transitioning avatar clients to press ganeys breadth of solutions pricing construct and contract term based on our current discussions and negotiations with these clients we would expect them to generate revenue of  million to  million per month in  given our anticipated success in transitioning avatars clients to our service model uptake of our greater offering of product solutions and pricing we do not anticipate breaking out the revenue contribution from avatars clients between acquired growth and organic growth in  our  revenue and adjusted ebitda expectations are based on our existing client base and anticipated  sales these full year expectations also incorporate the higher expense and lower margins in the fourth quarter that are associated with our national client conference these of course are projections and should our  client retention revenue retention or sales performance diverge from our expected performance our outlook for  revenue and adjusted ebitda would be impacted the business is historically been fairly predictable within a relatively narrow range therefore weve chosen to give our best estimate as of this call i will now pass the call back to pat patrick ryan thank you breht operator were opening it up the lines for questions please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from richard close with canaccord genuity your line is open patrick ryan good morning richard richard close good morning congratulations on a strong first half for the year i was wondering you talked a little bit about the nursing if you can go into a little bit more detail exactly what youre rolling out in the second half and then your one of the competitors in the space healthstream has done a couple of acquisitions with respect to the nursing area and i was wondered if you could just enlighten us may be what the differences are between what you guys are doing and what may be healthstream is doing is a complementary or is a competitive and just give us some insight on that front patrick ryan sure happy to do that so the nursing performance solutions for us will rollout at the end of the fourth quarter we will introduce it at our national client conference in november formally we have got some  clients who have been participating in the build of that program over time early adopters to that product and what its going to do is collect a number of analytics around overall nursing performance and allow hospitals who are on the magnet journey or those who are not to really look at analytics around overall nursing performance and automate a lot of the data that is not currently automated today so i think that will be very well received in the marketplace based upon our early work and market analysis i think it’s complementary to what healthstream is doing largely around certification and education for nursing so i dont view those two as competitor richard close okay i guess my second question here would be with respect to star ratings and i mean obviously you have the transparency product thats increasingly being rolled out it seems to be a lot of controversy over these star ratings and maybe if you could just chime in in terms of your thoughts of star ratings going forward as dictated by cms and just thoughts in and around that that would be great patrick ryan yeah i would take a step back and overall talking about measurement and consumerism in the marketplace i think the train has left the station and everyone recognizes that consumers need more data in order to make informed decisions about health systems the debate comes around the quality of the data and the speed with which it’s available to the consumer and so we’re supportive of measuring performance the challenge for some organizations is whether its scientifically collected and the realtime nature of that and i think the industry will evolve to realtime data so that consumers can make informed decisions as you look at our platform the advantage we have is our data analytics are scientifically collected across the board the data is realtime and we use the cms construct from which to go through our calculation so its complementary there so if you are a health system and youre looking at moving towards transparency you want to work with an organization that has the right data sets and have those data sets in realtime richard close all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from matthew gillmor with robert baird your line is open matthew gillmor hey thanks for taking the question i just wanted to ask one followup to richards question on the ndnqi product transition can you maybe just help us understand how that transition will take place will the existing clients on that product automatically transition to the new product or will there be a sales process associated with transitioning the existing client base patrick ryan there will be a sales process with ndnqi people will continue to use that product they are complementary in forum and the product will continue to evolve over time so dont think of any of our products really as a static state we continue to involve the analytic and as you think about our business today its really about collecting a robust data set to provide deeper insights into the health systems’ operations and help drive improvement and overall care coordination so as you think of our nursing product and ndnqi think of them as continually evolving with time matthew gillmor and then one sort of bigger picture question on the whitespace opportunity and some of the cahps requirements that are ahead of us and as we think about the expansion of the cahps programs into other areas within that continuum of care over the next several years and i guess i was thinking specifically of hospital outpatient ascs and emergency departments can you give us a sense for how penetrated those areas are already and is that already really part of the discussion with clients during  and  patrick ryan yeah i would say that it’s already a discussion with the majority of our clients lots of them there still remains white space in that area but the discussion has been ongoing for some time we have a number of clients who we measure in all of those areas to date but the way to look at cahps as we go forward is it continues to be an accelerant in the business both from the standpoint of just straight up doing the cahps work but more importantly looking at the overall analytic across the health system and moving from cahps to its operating data thats about sustaining your overall operation so i think it’s an accelerant to growth and continues to be so but the majority of our conversation with health systems is really about the entire enterprise and how one drives improvement and care coordination matthew gillmor great thanks very much for taking the question operator you next question comes from ryan daniels with william blair your line is open ryan daniels yeah good morning guys thanks for taking the questions pat let me ask a follow up for you on the censusbased surveying that’s seen very consistent growth over last few years and i’m curious based on the type of clients that have adopted that to date if you internally have a view of what the ultimate penetration of cbs could look like over the next few years patrick ryan i wouldn’t project out ultimately for you but what i would say about cbs is that that is a foundational element to looking at your health system on an enterprise view and having insights across the operation to drive improvement so those of our clients who have censusbased surveying are own able to then take advantage of our nursing product our engagement products and the integrated view that goes with it loyalty brand et cetera so without it it limits the insights that you can draw across your enterprise so i would expect it would continue to grow and one question ive been asked is does it make sense for smaller hospitals to do it versus larger hospitals and i would say if i were a hospital ceo it makes sense no matter what size hospital i’m running ryan daniels okay that’s helpful color and then in regards to the transparency tool i guess a twofold question one hoping to get a bit of an update on the binary relationship and maybe how thats helping you sell it or implement more rapidly and then number two it seems like a lot of marquee providers guys you know the cleveland clinic et cetera have adopted that i am curious if you see them as early adopters and then it will lag or if this type of solution once marquee player has it all others in the market will kind of be required to have that to meet consumer demand patrick ryan so the relationship with binary fountain is going very well the response from our clients has been excellent we will provide you with some detailed guidance as we go into  with regard to our expectations for its contribution in  as far as the large systems moving towards it i view this as a must for any health system so if you look at the major msas and as a system moves towards transparency i think youll see other competitive systems move towards transparency with time weve seen an uptick in it and i would expect that will continue with time ryan daniels okay thanks and congrats to the strong start to the year patrick ryan thank you operator your next question comes from nicholas jensen with raymond james your line is open nicholas jensen hey guys pat congratulations on a great quarter just wanted to followup on that last point on the transparency solution just wanted to get a sense as you present more information going forward how we think about the revenue model is it on a per doc basis i noticed you have a lot of this censusbased surveying growth because you actually need that detailed realtime information to drive the transparency solution but i just wanted to get your better sense of kind of the revenue model how is it evolved since the binary fountain partnership has come about patrick ryan so it’s going well and as i said we will provide you with some guidance at the end of the third quarter with regard to  and obviously we were pleased to date with the pipeline and build out to the process so as far as the pricing and the way in which we sell it it will probably depend upon the provider there is per doc calculations and there is overall enterprise pricing with regard to our relationships with clients so itll take on probably several different models nicholas jensen okay thats helpful and then on the ebitda margin continued to be quite strong i assume the transition more towards census base kind of helps that margin projection but just want to get your sense of was there anything in the quarter or really driving kind of that strong margin performance because the incremental ebitda growth relative to guidance race and the topline was quite good thanks patrick ryan i wouldnt say theres anything unique to the other quarters we continue to expand the census base we maintain cost controls across our ga and we always focus in those areas so i wouldnt say theres anything unique about the quarter nicholas jensen great thats all guys patrick ryan thank you operator your next question comes from andre benjamin with goldman sachs your line is open andre benjamin hi good morning patrick ryan hi andre how are you andre benjamin i am doing well thanks so you said avatar is going to have a revenue impact but not much ebitda contribution this year you talked a bit about revenue impact next year so i just want to think about ebitda for  knowing you are not giving explicit guidance maybe if i can ask you this way all else equal if that business were flat in revenue yearoveryear was you still report no ebitda in  or would some ebitda flow through as you improve the cost structure and some organic growth patrick ryan so what i have said is with regard to avatar you could  you should expect at a minimum a similar margin to our own business on that revenue in  and we will provide specific guidance as we go into the third quarter with regard to the business but it’s performing while the transition is going very well for us and you should expect that business would perform very consistently to our own business at a minimum andre benjamin great and i know you dont give explicit figures on product lines but any color you could provide on how much the organic growth has been driven by the core patient experience platform versus some of the other areas such as clinical engagement consultants are just trying to get a sense of penetration beyond the core platform patrick ryan the comments that i have made in the past and that they are consistent for this quarter as well is that the platform performs well across the enterprise and as we go out further in the future the way in which we contract generally includes a number of our products as we as  we grow the business so it’s really an enterprise pricing model but really in all categories we performed pretty well andre benjamin thank you operator the next question comes from jamie stockton with wells fargo your line is open jamie stockton hey good morning thanks for taking my… patrick ryan hey jamie jamie stockton good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess maybe a couple on the transparency solution i think nick alluded to this earlier but can you talk about what kind of a benefit you receive with the censusbased surveying work when health system adopt transparency incrementally i mean essentially are you guys getting paid to go back and hit people multiple times to try to improve the response rate so that you have rich enough data you know are there any percentages you can share about how much of an increase in contract value that generally drive patrick ryan so the way to think about transparency is it dependent upon a health system using censusbased survey to collect the right amount of data and censusbased surveying can increase the data collection you know  to  depends on the clients and the way in which we approach it that provides an end size significant enough to really allow providers to drive improvement through that process so core to deeper analytics core to segmentation and segmentation is the future of driving performance in health systems is censusbased products so thats foundational to transparency and then the other thing to think about with regard to transparency is scientifically collected data and providing certainty for our clients that that is being reported in scientific manner and that our clients are reporting a  of their work excluding some comments that may be viewed as inappropriate or phi so that approach is important to transparency in building your brand in a community as far as pricing on that i wont common on pricing just because the number of our competitors love to listen to these calls but what i will say is its a nice business for us and i would expect that it will add margin with time over the years and we will give you a little more specifics with regard to of that in the third quarter jamie stockton okay and then maybe just one other question on that front which is some of these early adopters of the transparency solution are you seeing any of them post quality scores that youre coming up with or the qualitative information on websites other than the providers on website and if they are can you talk about any of those other platforms you know are you essentially spreading some of the certified quality data on thirdparty platforms patrick ryan we havent seen that in any significant way todate and there is a way for them to do it and for us to partner to help them through the process but we havent seen that at this point time in significant way keep in mind one of the things that going to the transparency model helps the hospital to drive traffic to their website to move them up this google search to the top of the list within your community so and sharing that with other websites one has to think about what youre driving and the value youre giving other sites jamie stockton okay thats great thank you patrick ryan you are welcome operator your next question comes from peter heckmann with avondale partners your line is open patrick ryan hi peter peter heckmann good morning just wanted to talk about some of the changes in surveys as regards pain management and what role press ganey played in that as thought leader patrick ryan so we were supportive of taking those questions out of the calculation for value largely we still believe you need to measure pain as the indicator in any health system but the politics around those questions were confusing the facts so taking them out and getting away from using those questions in the debates around the issues with regard to the drug issues throughout the country i think was important to take those questions out so we were supportive of that i would emphasize to you that we studied this subject numerous times and several outside sources have studied and the subjects around drug use and the pain questions and theres really no correlation associated to those but i think its good that theyre taking them out of the debate so that we can focus on what the real issues are peter heckmann okay and then longer term question do you think some of the new regulations coming down the pike with regards to reimbursement will spur further consolidation practice management groups consolidating with larger systems and then how does that affect pricing and potentially the need to bundle services going forward patrick ryan so i would say consolidation in my estimate will continue throughout the health system in general the  and for us thats been a positive largely in that were very strong in the major top  msas around the country from a market share standpoint it allows us to integrate our product across the enterprise i think our approach is attractive to that model so i think its a overall benefit for us as time goes on peter heckmann okay thats helpful i will get back in the queue patrick ryan thank you operator your next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets your line is open jeff silber thanks so much i think you had said earlier on the call that your censusbased survey revenue was about  last year to  this year including avatar if my math is correct that would imply that your noncensusbased survey revenue went down yearoveryear is that correct or is it maybe just a classification issue but if not is there something going there that we should be aware about thanks patrick ryan there is nothing going on that you should be aware of it is just the conversion is the way to think about that we have existing clients that are moving to census which generally increases the overall value of the contract but you should see that number continue to go up in our overall calculation but it is added to the overall revenue jeff silber okay thats helpful and i know you don’t give specific quarterly guidance but is there anything that we should be aware about q versus q anything going on differently for me revenue perspective or on expense perspective thanks patrick ryan the only thing to keep in mind in the fourth quarter we have our expenses for the national client conference so you see margin drop in that quarter consistent with prior years jeff silber but nothing different from last year though patrick ryan nothing that im aware of no jeff silber okay thanks so much operator operator instructions your next question comes from donald hooker with keybanc your line is open donald hooker so my question again censusbased surveying which is so important watching that percentage go up every quarter which is great do we think of  is it something that  is it part of  typically part of the renewal process i mean you got transition from sort of the standard surveys to the digital surveys is it something that comes up  is that transition typically occur during the renewal process and is that whats driving that increasing percentage or does it sort of go up itself organically patrick ryan it’s part of the contracting process think about it really as the move is to collecting deeper data and the people recognizing that segmentation and analytics are playing a more important role in the overall health system so what censusbased surveying simply does for us is allow us to collect very cost efficiently materially more data for our clients and then to run across our analytic platform to give them much more specific insights so you see in both the renewal process and the sales process and in the conversion process with avatar that is part of the discussion donald hooker okay and then maybe a second question a similar question i asked in a different way maybe when you think about some of the bundled payment program you said coming out of cms i think you will have a small patient reported outcomes business that i believe is probably pretty small part of the business now but is there an application there that we should think about around some of the new bundles that might be coming out here shortly and maybe can you elaborate on that as an extension to your current patients experience offering patrick ryan sure two things to think about with regard to bundle payments one is if you have the censusbased survey data and youre looking at orthopedic or cardiac bundles you then to look at cardiac patients or orthopedic patients and how their in fact responding and what is their patient experience because you got enough data to look at subsets identified by the clinical experience so it is an important move if youre going to start to try to segment by patient population number two is around the promsbased product or patient reported outcome measures we have a very small business at this point in time it’s in our  roadmap to continue to enhance that product we would expect that to rollout you know in  it is not  there is no numbers in any of our guidance related to it but with time that product i think will be in a position to take advantage of it as the market starts to adopt them donald hooker okay i guess thats all for now thanks so much patrick ryan you are welcome operator last question comes from richard close with canaccord genuity your line is open richard close if we look at the  organic growth is there any way to split that up in terms of how much of coming you know from existing customers may be ramping up to this censusbased surveying how much  maybe you guys taking market share from others patrick ryan we said in the past that look at sort of  to  of our new business comes to existing clients and so i think thats the way to look at it i think the number itself is being affected by a number of things sales have been solid our cross sales have been solid with our engagement consulting products and then censusbased surveying site i think it’s been impacted by all of those numbers richard close okay thank you patrick ryan you are welcome operator we have no further questions i turn the call back over to the presenters patrick ryan well

forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which relate to future not past events and are subject to risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements which address the companys expected business and financial performance and financial condition among other matters contain words such as “believe” “could” “opportunities” “continue” “expect” “may” “will” or “would” and other words and terms of similar meaning forwardlooking statements by their nature address matters that are to different degrees uncertain such as statements about expected income earnings revenues and growth although the company believes the expectations reflected in such forwardlooking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions it can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following because our clients are concentrated in the healthcare industry our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in regulations a business downturn or consolidation in the healthcare industry if our clients do not continue to purchase our products and solutions or we are unable to attract new clients our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected the loss of several of our large clients or a significant reduction in business from such clients would adversely affect our operating results we may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth we may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry we may not be able to develop new products and solutions or enhancements to our existing products and solutions or be able to achieve widespread acceptance of new products or solutions technological developments could render our products and solutions obsolete or uncompetitive we may be unable to effectively identify complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions joint ventures collaborative arrangements or other growth investments we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth effectively which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and growth prospects we operate in an increasingly competitive market which could adversely affect our revenue and market share if we fail to promote and maintain awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner our business might suffer we may not be able to maintain our certification to conduct cms mandated surveys and this could adversely affect our business we depend on our senior management and we may be materially harmed if we lose any member of our senior management data security and integrity are critically important to our business and actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions errors or failure in connection with our or thirdparty information technology and communication systems and other software and hardware products used in connection with our business we may be liable to our clients and may lose clients if we are unable to collect and maintain client data or if we lose client data protection of our intellectual property may be difficult and costly and our inability to protect our intellectual property could reduce the value of our products and solutions the agreements governing our  credit agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure indebtedness under our  credit agreement our internal control over financial reporting does not currently meet the standards required by section  of the sarbanesoxley act a further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the company’s filings with the securities and exchange commission including its annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q and its registration statement on form s and the accompanying prospectus filed with the securities and exchange commission on may   these or other uncertainties may cause the company’s actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in any forwardlooking statements the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements nongaap financial measures the company defines adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest expense net income taxes depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to add back i items that were terminated in connection with the ipo ii noncash charges iii nonrecurring items that are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the business and iv items that are solely related to changes in our capital structure and therefore are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the business the company defines adjusted net income as net income adjusted for noncash and other nonrecurring items management uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income i to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis ii to calculate incentive compensation for our employees iii for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget iv to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies and v to assess compliance with various metrics associated with the agreements governing our indebtedness we also believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance because these measures are similar to the metrics used by investors and other interested parties when comparing companies in our industry that have different capital structures debt levels andor income tax rates accordingly we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in the same manner as our management adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are not determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income income from operations net cash provided by operating
