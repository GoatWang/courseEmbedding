specific focus on combining tissue engineering and stem cell biology to improve heart function in various patient populations current projects in our laboratory include the following cardiac conduction through engineered tissue – we are engineering tissues to act as electrical conduits for use in pediatric patients with complete heart block ultimately we hope to provide a realistic alternative or accessory treatment to conventional cardiac pacemaker implantation in children adult stem cell culture – we are developing methods to expand and control the fate of tissuespecific stem cells to determine their regenerative potential for the treatment of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders our studies are designed to advance cellbased therapies for a variety of human diseases noninvasive tracking of transplanted cells – we are assessing noninvasive imaging methods to serially track the retention distribution and function of transplanted cells in the heart we believe these methods will have immediate relevance for assessing the efficacy of cardiac cellbased therapies mitochondrial transplantation – this collaborative project is focused on providing a clinicallyrelevant treatment for myocardial infarction in adults we and our colleagues are injecting autologous mitochondria into the heart to decrease the extent of damage and enhance functional recovery about douglas
