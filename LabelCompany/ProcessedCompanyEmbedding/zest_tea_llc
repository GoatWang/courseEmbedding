coffee it’s the thing that wakes our senses in the morning and keeps us alert all day so when we received a box in the mail from philadelphiabased company zest tea a product which claims to be the most caffeinated tea on the market we were intrigued and skeptical zest is a product that promises the same caffeine punch as a cup of coffee – that’s three times the amount of normal teas the level of caffeine in each of the four varieties varies depending on what you choose the earl grey black apple cinnamon black and blue lady black all have  mgcup while the milder pomegranate mojito green has about  mgcup for three days five of us volunteered to replace our coffee with zest tea each day we kept a brief diary of our experience which flavor we had we tried all but apple cinnamon how many times we loaded up with a new bag and our general thoughts on the drink versus our beloved coffee  first impressions each variety of zest comes in a lightweight cylindrical canister with  individual packets the teabags themselves are really beautiful the loose leaves come in a biodegradable pyramid satchel that allows you to see vibrant colors of the ingredients especially in the blue lady the company sources ingredients from the nilgiri region of india and the anhui province of china so you can really smell and see the quality we unanimously agreed that the smell of this tea is powerful and pleasant even before we put it in hot water so far so good  steep  sip the aroma of a hot brewed cup left a nice lingering fragrance around our desks the pomegranate mojito green had the most enjoyable sent    while the smell was overall favorable many thought the flavor was a bit much “the tea is strong and the flavor is too overpowering if the bag is left in the cup for too long” said staff photographer steph aaronson “there is also no string to pull the bag out so having a spoon handy is necessary” zest recommends that your tea steeps for  minutes what many of us noticed including myself is that less than  minutes after having several sips from our cup we felt “in the zone” almost more clearheaded than we would normally be with coffee by our side staff writer nick vadala admitted to drinking at least  cups of coffee on a daily basis with zest he cut down to  cups of tea which proved to him that it matched if not exceeded the caffeine content in a cup of coffee “it definitely hits you harder but i didnt get jittery or anything” he said “the real benefits are that you drink less so therefore less calories are taken in and the tea feels like its a little easier on your stomach than coffee can be”  it was quite the opposite for staff photographer colin kerrigan who had an average of  cups of coffee a day he said that zest’s high levels of caffeine left him with “a weird head high” and recommends not drinking it on an empty stomach “tea is nice to have in certain situations but its just not my morning coffee” he said i like colin drink about  cups of coffee everyday so i experienced that same head high during the morning hours of day one in succeeding days i lost that jittery feeling but retained the alertness and clarity contrary to colin’s feedback i drank the tea on an empty stomach and it was actually very soothing in my belly conclusion while we all really enjoyed the flavors and smells of the tea after day one we couldn’t help but yearn for our old friend coffee but that doesn’t mean we had abandoned the idea of tea both steph and executive entertainment producer leah kauffman replaced their afternoon coffee with zest and said it “provided a flavorful pickmeup” and found that it actually stopped their cravings for coffee worth it zest tea costs about  depending on your chosen flavor each cylinder comes with  satchels of loose tea leaves which we think you can salvage at least two cups out of depending on your boldness preference we think regular and occasional tea drinkers will really enjoy this brand but if youre a dedicated coffee drinker dont expect to be wooed by this product you cant pick it up in stores just yet but you can order online read more by gabrielle bonghi more coverage we tried it chocolate
