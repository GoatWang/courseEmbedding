mv agusta filorosso is out there and maybe worth whatever it takes to get one the handbuilt magni mv agusta filorosso is a retro race bike that actually worksone problem with modernday retro bikes is that in trying to combine ancient with modern they often risk embracing the worst of both worlds and the best of neither in trying to recreate all our yesterdays in a modern context their builders sometimes end up with too much motor for the chassis or insufficient poke to pull the skin off a rice pudding better to just stick the result on display and simply look at it reflecting as you do how far and how fast the world has moved on since the bike it’s trying to honor first did its thingto read this in cycle news digital edition click herephotography by kel edgebut then every so often one comes along that is so totally right and so luscious to look at as well as fun to ride that you forget all the times you’ve been disappointed and start looking at yesterday through distinctly rosetinted spectacles for sure that’s the case with italy’s magni mv agusta filorosso triple that’s now being handbuilt in limited quantities—sufficient nonetheless to constitute series production—by giovanni magni in the moto magni factory north of milan at samarate that’s a stone’s throw from mv’s former race hq at gallarate where his late dad arturo who passed away last december at the age of  led the historic italian trophy marque’s gp team bankrolled by the profits of count agusta’s helicopter factory to a remarkable haul of  road racing world championships in  years hand built at the magni moto factory in italy the magni mv agusta filorosso has been a big hit in europe and there is talk of building it in the mv agusta factorydream come trueit’s hard to think of any company more entitled than moto magni to use a current mv agusta model to produce an authentic retroracer and that’s what the firm’s director arturo’s youngest son giovanni  has indeed now done in going back to the future in creating the filorosso—italian for “red line” as in taking it to the limit this exquisitely designed superbly executed and classically striking roadlegal threecylinder racerwithlights looks for all the world like the  triple that mv’s time world champion giacomo agostini took to seven successive  gp world titles from ’ before switching to yamaha but in fact it’s a cleverly concocted creation which uses an unmodified modern liquidcooled brutale  motor sourced together with the eldor ecu and wiring harness directly from today’s mv agusta factory  miles away on the shores of lake varesethis has been wrapped by giovanni in a tigwelded open cradle chromemoly tubular steel frame using the engine as a fully stressed component that recalls ago’s world titlewinning triple’s twinloop chassis complete with boxsection twinshock swingarm and inch wheels these are in fact sixspoke cast magnesium items as fitted to mv’s later  fourcylinder gp racers and are the product of the magni family’s other business the epm wheel manufacturer run by giovanni’s elder brother carlo giacomo agostini would be proud“i always dreamed of making a modern magni mv in the same way as my father did  years ago when he started our company” says giovanni magni “and many of our existing customers were asking us to make an mv agustabased bike that was a blend of today’s engineering with traditional aesthetics—a bike that recalls mv’s glorious history but in a modern context with today’s performance but i was always reluctant to do so because of the responsibility of living up to the expectations created by such a historic marque i mean you can’t dare to even think of building a bad mv a bike that doesn’t meet the high standards set by that badge on the tank can you”giovanni’s first magni mv tribute bike was the fourcylinder storia a classically restyled stockframed brutale  that was unveiled at the  milan show and continues in production but although he’s delivered over  such bikes and has more orders coming in all the time giovanni got criticized by some for just offering a change of clothes with the storia because it doesn’t have a magni frame so without telling anyone else not even their dad he and carlo decided to make a threecylinder bike using the  brutale f motor in a purposebuilt periodstyle magni framethe two brothers finished the prototype filorosso three days before the opening of the  eicma milan show “it was complete but not running so we just took some photos of it and posted them on our website with a few words explaining what it was then went to bed” recalls giovanni with a smile “next morning we found the website had crashed and we had a dozen orders for the bike without anyone knowing the price for the simple reason we hadn’t decided on it yet ourselves”one year later the definitive version was displayed at eicma  having been extensively road tested to iron out any problems and production kicked off with the bikes built in batches of five at a taxfree price of approximately  and a sixmonth lead time before delivery author alan cathcart is still impressed by the mv’s retro performanceback to the futurei’ve been privileged to ride many wonderful racers down the years from fogarty ducatis to valentino’s m yamahas and a host of exotic classic racers into the bargain but the one that gets my blood racing and my heart soaring is the mv agusta triple because no other motorcycle so completely captures the sound as well as the substance of twowheeled exotica of the kind of engineering mystique that wins serial world titles it’s the one i’m fortunate to have ridden one of the  genuine threecylinder gp racers in both  and  versions which count agusta’s race team built in total down the years as well as the last of the six evoluzione bikes produced by claudio castiglioni before he died so i have a pretty good idea of what it’s like to sit on the bike that as for many other people is right up there when it comes to settling on my favorite ever racebike and the filorosso is uncannily similar right down to its deceptively diminutive stature even without its clothes on the filorosso looks “decent”though it’s so perfectly proportioned that until you sit aboard the magni mv you’ve no idea it’s so relatively tiny—quite low but also pretty short with a compact inch wheelbase against t inches for ago’s gp racer removing all sense of bulk—it’s not until you see it without the fairing that you’re aware of how perfectly packaged the filorosso is thanks to the f engine being painted silver and thus pretty eyecatching the lowmounted stock brutale water radiator is so visually unobtrusive that you don’t really notice it there’s just enough space for a ’” rider though the footrests are very high giovanni magni says he had to raise them because his youthful supersport test rider kept decking them and you’re pretty much wedged in place seated quite far back on top of the rear suspensionthis gives room for you to stretch out along the  gallon handbeaten aluminum fuel tank to the lowmounted steeply dropped clipons and in so doing make space to crouch behind the screen as well as make a stab at tucking your knees inside the fairing in a straight line you’re discouraged from moving about the bike thanks to the cramped riding position but that’s okay because the way to ride a motorcycle like this is definitely not to try to hang off it and stick your knee on the ground instead you must try to keep tucked in aboard it and use the sharp steering geometry a º rake for the fully adjustable but definitely periodlooking forcella italia conventional fork with just  inches of trail via a  inches offset on the machinedfromsolid triple clamps to flick the filorosso through tighter turns while you stay glued to the seat the filorosso is anything but roomy in the cockpitmoreover i found you must keep up turn speed in faster fourthgear bends at the pirelli test track where i rode the bike by relying on the good grip from the skinny  zr metzeler roadtec z mounted on the  inch epm front rim to stay tucked behind the screen in pursuit of extra mph riding the filorosso is just like racing a classic  single only with a lot more power and heaps more music the bodywork is just wide enough to give good streamlining with your shoulders adequately protected by the fairly broad screen as you wrap yourself around the tank and allow your eyes to peer at the rather cluttered stock mv dash sorry no periodstyle whitefaced veglia tacho giovanni magni has jettisoned the traction control and antiwheelie control programs incorporated in this by simply not installing the requisite sensors and there’s no abs either but he’s thankfully retained the powershifter on the streetpattern sixspeed gearbox and listening to the three gracefully tapering megaphone pipes’ slightly muted via internal silencing but still gloriously evocative exhaust note change just an octave or so as you hit a higher gear rounding a wideopen sweeper is twowheeled audio paradise so too when you crack the throttle open is the suction roar coming from the trio of mm mikuni throttle bodies nestling openly beneath the fuel tank each is protected against stones and debris as was the way back then by a wire mesh cover over its induction trumpet aka velocity stack thanks to the stock brutale airbox having been jettisoned we still have yet met a triple that we didn’t likewe’d come to the pista pirelli for me to ride the bike because ahem it isn’t road legal in italy in spite of being supplied with full lighting equipment with the front headlamp neatly inserted in the nose of the gpstyle fairing and covered by a yellow raceplate that can be unbolted the turn signals and other such hardware come courtesy of the neighboring rizoma factory close by moto magni’s base whose rd boss is coincidentally exmv agusta gp mechanic fiorenzo fanali later with yamaha cagiva and kawasaki the reason the filorosso isn’t homologated for the street is simply one of cost plus the time needed to add abs sanitize the exhaust system via a catalyst and figure out a way of wrapping the throttle bodies in some kind of airbox however there’s a good reason for that “we have many orders for the bike in spite of the fact it’s not road legal in italy” says giovanni magni “we leave it to our customers in whichever country they live in to get it registered there if they wish to but i know some of them prefer just to ride it on the track it’s their choice”the result is a motorcycle that’s as authentic a modernday tribute as it’s possible to get to what’s arguably the most iconic italian racebike ever made even if the only thing missing is the tennis ball with the top cut off which ago used to mount on the left clipon in which he’d carry a damp sponge with which to wipe insects off his goggles during the hourlong gp races or twohour tts of the day we have tearoffs today instead modern but still authentic but where’s the half tennis ball for wiping off the bugsanother more important difference is that while not exactly inexpensive the magni filorosso is worth a fraction of the cost in purely cash terms let alone in historic value of a genuine factory mv racer so that means you can ride it in something approaching anger in a way that would be unthinkable today on a period bike the mv triples you see racing today in the goodwood revival and classic tt are all replicas doing so at the pista pirelli revealed a bike that feels small light low slung and very well balanced with light agile steering and good feedback from the front metzeler it holds a line well and even though the twin rear shocks are period kit that isn’t very sophisticated in damping terms there aren’t enough bumps on the pista pirelli to deliver an examination of their capability but in spite of being so short the magni filorosso was super stable around a fast fifthgear sweeper and it not only steers well but stops brilliantly too the brakes almost work too goodthe twin mm brembo front discs gripped by axially mounted fourpot calipers are heaps more effective than the drum brakes fitted to the early gp triples or the plasmasprayed aluminum hunt discs which replaced them the filorosso’s vastly more effective brembo package is more than good enough to haul a bike weighing  pounds dry down hard from high speed though you must be careful about squeezing too hard on the adjustable lever else with that short wheelbase you risk streetsweeping the tarmac with the back wheel in the air you must make a point of using the rear mm brake with its twinpiston caliper a fraction before you brake really hard with the front to preload the suspension on such a short bike and get the  weight bias to work in your favor the filorosso sounds as good as the pipes lookanother big difference on the filorosso is the brutale  motor’s electric leg so instead of the bump start that ago was so adept at on the gp triple you just thumb the starter button but you’ll invariably find yourself sitting there for a moment relishing the rasping offbeat engine note before you head out onto the track the threecylinder brutale  engine pulls strongly from low down and you can accelerate wide open in sixth gear from just  revs without a hint of transmission snatch at  rpm it starts to take off and you can feel the extra kick at around  rpm when you hit maximum torque then surf the curve all the way to the grand limiter accompanied by that deep sonorous exhaust note that’s good enough to bottle magicriding the magni mv filorosso was an emotional trip down memory lane complete with all mod cons—well except tc and abs i suppose i bet arturo magni went to meet his maker suitably content with the ultimate creation of the brand he founded  years ago retro bikes don’t come any better than this cnspecifications magni mv agusta filorossoenginewatercooled dohc transverse inline cylinder stroke w  valves per
