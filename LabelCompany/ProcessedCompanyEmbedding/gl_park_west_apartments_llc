forms of injunctive relief before the court is owners motion for summary judgment pursuant to cplr  seeking  dismissal of plaintiffs complaint in its entirety and  a judgment declaring that the subject building is and has always been subject to federal preemption from local rent regulation plaintiffs oppose dismissal and crossmove for summary judgment on their first cause of action for a declaration that the building is subject to local rent regulation or if the court finds that federal preemption is applicable that the building is governed by hud handbook guidelines background facts the initial  subsidy and regulatory agreement owners predecessor jacob haberman the former owner took title to the building on or about july   owner aff ¶  owner exh cfn pl affirm ¶  fn  at the time the subject property consisted of nine separate tenement buildings known as  through  central park west which were rehabilitated and combined into a single apartment building to be used as rental housing for low and moderate income families owner aff ¶  the building contains  units owner aff ¶  on july   in connection with the proposed rehabilitation of the building the former owner and the federal housing administration fha entered into a regulatory agreement for limited distribution mortgagor projects under section d of the national housing act as amended owner aff ¶  def exh e the  regulatory agreement the former owner obtained a belowmarket  year mortgage loan for the building classifying the building as a subsidized project or a § d below market interest rate project owner aff ¶  the loan the loan was secured by a secured note insured and subsidized by the fha commissioner id tenants first moved into the newlyunified building in january of  id the  grant in or about  the former owner applied for and hud granted a flexible subsidy grant pursuant to  usc § za also known as section  of the housing and community development amendments of  the  subsidy the former owner and hud entered into a financial assistance contract on or about february   in connection with the  grant the  subsidy contract the  subsidy contract required the former owner to maintain the low and moderateincome character of the project until the loans maturity date subsequently amended to extend until april   owner aff ¶  pl affirm ¶ fn from the loans origination to the owners prepayment of the loan on december   the parties agree that federal law preempted local and state regulations the loan prepayment and use agreement in  the former owner was considering prepayment of the loan owner aff ¶  concerned that prepayment might end federal preemption of local and state regulations the former owner sought the opinion of the new york state division of housing and community renewal dhcr regarding federal preemption of local rent regulation pursuant to a superseding use agreement  essentially a contract between hud and owner setting forth rules regulations and obligations relating to the building after prepayment id exh j the use agreement  the use agreement set forth among other things the regulatory scheme for the building after prepayment owner aff ¶  exh j part of the use agreement indicated that the owner agreed to continue the low and moderate income affordability restrictions  and has agreed to continue certain other restrictions until april   owner aff ¶¶  exh j at  as relevant here the use agreements preemption provision provides that effective immediately upon the prepayment of the mortgage note the prior use agreement the regulatory agreement and any and all other documents applying to the project granted in favor of the commissioner or the department of housing ansic urban development or to which the commissioner or the department of housing and urban development is a party shall be terminated and of no further force or effect except that this use agreement shall continue huds preemption of state andor local rent regulation owner aff ¶  exh j ¶  emphasis added on december   in response to owners request dhcr issued an opinion letter which found that huds position that the project should retain its preemption after prepayment of its mortgage is clearly reasonable and that it is dhcrs opinion that after prepayment of its mortgage the building should remain free of any existing new york city rent regulation until such time as hud relinquishes its level of control of the project presumably this would occur at the expiration of the above described use agreement owner aff ¶  exh i emphasis added fn in or about november of  owner and hud executed the use agreement shortly thereafter on or about december   owner prepaid the loan owner aff ¶  exh j pl affirm ¶  there is nothing in the record evidencing plaintiffs receipt of or response to the use agreement itselffn after owner recorded the use agreement on or about march   owner entered into new leases with various plaintiffs owner aff ¶  a rider accompanying these leases bore in boldface and underlined capital letters language explicitly informing the tenant that pursuant to a hud use agreement federal law preempted any otherwiseapplicable state or local law including the rsl owner aff ¶  exh lfn beginning in  owner began to charge and plaintiffs began to pay the annual  rent increases authorized by the use agreement owner aff ¶  plaintiffs commence this action on november   plaintiffs filed the complaint which asserts four causes of action seeking  a judgment declaring that local rent regulations were not preempted by the use agreement and therefore that tenants apartments were subject to the rsl since november of   if the rsl is found applicable individual money judgments for all plaintiffs representing the difference between the amount charged under the use agreement and the lower amount which should have been charged under the rsl together with treble damages costs attorneys fees and injunctive relief directing owner to register the building with the dhcr office of rent regulation and calculate future rents in compliance with the rsl  pursuant to general business law h an order and judgment enjoining unlawful acts by owner and awarding treble monetary damages and attorneys fees and  if the use agreement is found to preempt the rsl an order declaring that plaintiffs rent increases did not comply with the hud handbook and that future rent increases shall comply and a judgment for each plaintiff refunding all noncompliant rent payments owners motion and plaintiffs crossmotion owner moves for summary judgment on all causes of action plaintiffs oppose owners motion and crossmove for summary judgment only on the first cause of action plaintiffs also ask that if the court finds federal preemption applicable that the court also find the hud handbook applicable and reserve for trial any determination of alleged violations of the handbook discussion i summary judgment generally to prevail on a motion for summary judgment the proponent must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law through admissible evidence eliminating all material issues of fact zuckerman v city of new york  nyd     once the moving party has satisfied these standards the burden shifts to the opponent to rebut that prima facie showing by producing contrary evidence in admissible form sufficient to require a trial of material factual issues amatulli v delhi constr corp  nyd    in determining the motion the court must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party ssbs realty corp v public service mut ins co  add   nysd  st dept  martin v briggs  add   nysd  st dept   thus a party opposing a summary judgment motion must assemble and lay bare its affirmative proof to demonstrate that genuine triable issues of fact exist kornfeld v nrx tech inc  add   nysd   affd  nyd    owner and plaintiffs move and crossmove respectively for summary judgment on the first cause of action and thus each bears the initial burden on their respective argument owner also moves for summary judgment dismissing the second through fourth causes of action and thus bears the initial burden on those arguments ii first cause of action — federal preemption owners initial motion seeks summary judgment declaring that the use agreement entered between owner and hud preempts local rent regulation plaintiffs seek summary judgment declaring that the use agreement lacks preemptive effect for the reasons set forth below the court finds the use agreement reviewable and finds the use agreements preemption substantively and procedurally invalid a federal preemption generally the supremacy clause provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land  any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding us const art vi cl  congressional preemption of state law thus occurs through the direct operation of the supremacy clause kurns v rr friction products corp  us    s ct     congressional intent to preempt generally manifests in one of three circumstances express field or conflict preemption first under express preemption congress can express its intent to preempt state law with explicit statutory language english v gen elec co  us  —  citing shaw v delta air lines inc  us  —  hawaiian airlines inc v norris  us   schneidewind v anr pipeline co  us     second under field preemption state law is preempted where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively as inferred from a scheme of federal regulation  so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it or where an act of congress touches a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject english  us at — citing rice v santa fe elevator corp  us    new york smsa ltd pship v town of clarkstown  fd   d cir  field preemption occurs where congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law  third under conflict preemption state law is preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law english  us at  this occurs where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress gade v natl solid wastes mgt assn  us    finding that a state law regulating occupational health and safety must yield to its federal counterparts  the parties agree that the national housing act the nha completely preempted local rent regulation until the use agreement was signed the parties also agree that the use agreements preemption clause is explicit the dispute centers around whether the use agreement a private contract between hud and owner can have the same preemptive effect as federal law including authorized federal regulation and if so whether the use agreement complied with due process b procedural arguments  timeliness of plaintiffs challenge to administrative action owner argues in its reply brief that this action is timebarred because plaintiffs waited too long after enactment of the use agreement to challenge it plaintiffs respond that this action involves a statute of limitations conflict between federal and new york law and that where such a conflict exists state law — which imposes no time bar — should control at minimum plaintiffs argue any overcharge claims pertaining to the four years prior to the complaints filing would still fall within cplr a as an initial matter the court need not consider this argument arguments advanced for the first time in reply papers are entitled to no consideration by a court entertaining a summary judgment motion clearwater realty co v hernandez  add   st dept   nevertheless the court addresses it here for the sake of completeness and finds that this claim is not timebarred the relevant statute  usc § a captioned time for commencing action against united states provides that absent an explicit statute of limitations  every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues emphasis added this applies to actions against the united states challenging administrative actions for which the statute of limitations begins to run at the time the challenged agency action becomes final  usc §  sai kwan wong v doar  fd   d cir   however the sixyear statute of limitations does not bar this action because first this is an action against a private party relating to an agency action but not an action against the united states because hud is not a party and second because the relevant agency action was not truly final in determining whether an agency action is sufficiently final to trigger the running of the statute of limitations the core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties giammarco v beers  f supp d   d conn appeal dismissed oct    the relevant action and result here are the use agreements preemption of local rent regulation alleged by plaintiffs to have resulted in significant overcharging both the decisionmaking process and the effect of that process are relevant to this determination and the court finds that neither the use agreement nor its preemption provision were the product of proper administrative procedure and thus could not be considered final such that the statute of limitations ever began to run with respect to the process preemption may result not only from action taken by congress itself a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may preempt state regulation gen motors corp v abrams  fd   d cir  citing louisiana public service commission v fcc  us     however such provisions gain preemptive effect only after following prescribed rulemaking procedures wabash val power assn inc v rural electrification admin  fd  — th cir  easterbrook j in order to preempt state authority the rea must establish rules with the force of law we have not found any case holding that a federal agency may preempt state law without either rulemaking or adjudication   rules promulgated without proper procedure — notice opportunity for comment statement of basis administrative record publication in the federal register — lack the force of law id citing thomas v new york  fd  dc cir  scalia j cf abrams  fd at  holding that consent order signed by federal agency had preemptive effect particularly in light of the intensive negotiations and extensive public comment that informed its decision emphasis added see also united states v ferrara  f supp   ddc  affd  fd  dc cir amended july    a policy memorandum purported to have preemptive effect issued by the head of an executive agency simply is not the equivalent of federal law the memorandum was neither promulgated pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking nor published in the federal register  moreover in determining finality the supreme court has looked to among other things whether its impact is sufficiently direct and immediate and has a direct effect on  daytoday business franklin v massachusetts  us  —   under either prong of the finality determination owners argument fails there is no indication that hud either followed proper procedure or that plaintiffs had sufficient knowledge of the use agreements preemption provision or effect — or indeed any of the use agreements substantive terms — to begin accrual under the sixyear statute of limitations accordingly this action is not timebarred  hud as an indispensable party to the extent that owner also argues that plaintiffs claims cannot be adjudicated without joining hud as a party this claim is also raised improperly in reply nevertheless joinder of an agency is required only where the agency is necessary for a complete resolution where the agency will be inequitably affected by any possible judgment or where an agencys past or future conduct can undermine a judgment brodsky v selden sanitary corp  add  — d dept  citing city of new york v long is airports limousine serv corp  nyd    an adverse determination requiring an agency requires overlapping interests  under this standard owners argument is undermined by its initial motion for summary judgment which in seeking judgment on all causes of action as a matter of law implies that all of the facts necessary for disposition of this action are already before the court accordingly huds absence does not necessitate dismissal  whether hud determination is reviewable judicial review of an agency action to preempt is available to the extent that a plaintiff claims  that huds procedure for approving a preemption request violates his rights to due process or  that hud failed to comply with its own regulations regarding preemption requests gramercy spire tenants assn v harris  f supp   sdny   to the extent that plaintiffs allege both the use agreements preemption clause is reviewable a substantive arguments  chevron deference owner argues that hud acted reasonably under the authority delegated to the agency by congress through the fha and should thus be entitled to chevron deference see generally chevron usa inc v natural res def council inc  us    in opposition plaintiffs argue that only formal agency actions are entitled to such deference whereas huds actions here were informal the initial question is whether or not the statute clearly and unambiguously prohibits the practices of which the plaintiffs complain if the intent of congress is clear that is the end of the matter for the court as well as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress kruse v wells fargo home mortg inc  fd   d cir   here the hud action in question — continuation of federal preemption under the use agreement — derives not from the nha which contains no preemption provision but huds own regulation if the provisions of the statute are unclear or ambiguous then courts may further examine whether and to what degree to defer to the agencys interpretation of the statute id deference is generally required when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority id at  citing united states v mead corp  us  —   if the agencys reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislatures design courts give that reading controlling weight even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding kruse  fd at  most agency interpretations that have qualified for chevron deference are rules that have been promulgated in regulations issued through notice and comment or adjudication or in another format authorized by congress for use in issuing legislative rules estate of landers v leavitt  fd   d cir  as rev jan    plaintiffs note correctly that the use agreements preemption clause here is not an administrative determination that fills a statutory gap left by congress but instead a form of private preemption falling outside the scope of any statute or regulation similarly the process preceding the action is opaque at best accordingly the clause merits additional examination nonlegislative interpretations are not automatically disqualified by reason of informality alone estate of landers  fd at  such interpretations remain entitled to respect according to its persuasiveness as evidenced by the thoroughness evident in the agencys consideration the validity of its reasoning its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements and all those factors which give it power to persuade id at  finding department of health and human service manual persuasive after examining extensive relatively formal nature of the manual quoting us v mead corp  us     again the court finds plaintiffs arguments persuasive on this issue huds action was informal in the sense that it lacked any formal noticeandcomment period or any other procedural rigor beyond owners request to the dhcr for an opinion letter while that step is certainly a factor to be considered it does not alone constitute a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement of such force mead  us at  cf smiley v citibank south dakota n a  us    apa notice and comment designed to assure due deliberation  accordingly the court finds that huds actions are reviewable  effect of preemption clause in use agreement in determining whether federal preemption is applicable the critical question in any preemption analysis is always whether congress intended that federal regulation supersede state law louisiana pub serv comn v fcc  us    rosario v diagonal realty llc  nyd    the courts sole task is to ascertain the intent of congress fn in ascertaining congressional intent a presumption against preemption generally exists in areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states in such spheres congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest english  us at — citing jones v rath packing co  us    medtronic inc v lohr  us    s ct    l ed d   see eg lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us   advertising egelhoff v egelhoff ex rel breiner  us   domestic relations  the court of appeals has recognized housing to be such a sphere rosario  nyd at  thus any preemption of local rent regulation by the nha must have been intended by congress since the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text the starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself giving effect to the plain meaning thereof new york skyline inc v city of ny  add  — st dept  citing bluebird partners v first fid bank  nyd    in all cases requiring statutory construction we begin with an examination of the statutes plain meaning centurion v sessions  fd   d cir  statutory construction begins with the plain text and if that text is unambiguous it usually ends there as well  in enacting the nha congress established hud and directed the hud secretary to among other things encourage private enterprise to serve as large a part of the nations total housing and urban development needs as it can and develop the fullest cooperation with private enterprise in achieving the objectives of the department   usca §  to effectuate this aim nha authorized hud to issue regulations implementing that law  usc § et seq  usc § d  the nha itself does not contain any preemption provision instead preemption derives from  cfr  which reads the department finds that it is necessary and desirable to minimize defaults by the mortgagor in its financial obligations with regard to projects covered by this subpart and to assist mortgagors to preserve the continued viability of those projects as a housing resource for lowincome families the department also finds that it is necessary and desirable to protect the substantial economic interest of the federal government in those projects therefore the department concludes that it is in the national interest to preempt and it does hereby preempt the entire field of rent regulation by local rent control boards hereinafter referred to as board or other authority acting pursuant to state or local law as it affects projects covered by this subpart emphases addedin turn  cfr  provides that said subpart applies to all projects with mortgages insured or held by hud that receive a subsidy in the form of as relevant here b belowmarket interest rates under section d and  of the national housing act see also city of boston v harris  fd   st cir  the rules were adopted after notice and comment procedure and rested on legislative type findings amply supporting the rule  preemption in this context is particularly significant in this context because federal and local rent regulation often affect each other adversely see eg gramercy spire tenants assn v harris  f supp   sdny  hud determined in adopting the regulation that local rent control ordinances while not the sole factor are a significant factor in causing owner defaults on hudinsured mortgages   given these divergent purposes federal and local regulation clearly cannot exist in the same space and therefore intent to preempt must be explicit the provisions quoted above read together demonstrate a clear intent to preempt local rent regulation in service of minimizing defaults by the mortgagor in its financial obligations with regard to projects covered by this subpart — that is subsidized mortgages insured or held by hud — and to assist mortgagors to preserve the continued viability of those projects as a housing resource for lowincome families reading the regulations together leads the court to conclude that prepayment of a subsidized mortgage satisfies the aims of the regulation and thus concludes the federal preemption designed to effectuate the regulations aims at that point the congressional interest in a projects financial viability dissipates and so too does congresss authorization for federal law to preempt local rent regulation see eg  w th realty llc v new york div of hous and community renewal  add  st dept  dhcr rationally determined that upon the termination of the federal mortgage premises became subject to local rent stabilization accord  chelsea assoc llc v dobler  misc d   app term st dept  see also gramercy spire tenants assn  f supp at  unsubsidized projects enjoy preemption only upon a finding of jeopardy to huds economic interest  thus any preemption effectuated by the  regulatory agreement and explicitly authorized by congress ended on december   the undisputed date of prepayment owner argues however that preemption continued by virtue of the use agreement an agreement between owner and hud addressing contractual preemption of local regulation the court again begins with the proposition that preemption must be explicit and should be disfavored in arenas traditionally reserved for the states notably owner does not cite and the court cannot locate support for the proposition that owner and hud could substantively agree to preempt local rent regulation by contract or support for the process by which the preemption occurred the lack of explicit congressional intent is problematic as noted by other courts in an analogous context for example in empire healthchoice assur inc v mcveigh the second circuit analyzed the effect of a contract between the united states office of personnel management opm a federal agency and a private entity pursuant to the federal employees health benefits act the benefits act  fd   d cir  sotomayor j affd  us    in finding that the matter lacked federal jurisdiction because federal preemption was not triggered thenjudge sotomayor noted a peculiar feature of the benefits act relevant here  usc § m which provides that certain types of contract terms would supersede and preempt state laws judge sotomayor contrasted the contractual preemption provision with explicit statutory preemption provisions found elsewhere in federal law noting that the constitutionality of federal preemption is after all grounded in the supremacy clause of the constitution which provides that the laws of the united states  shall be the supreme law of the land  any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstandingtaken literally therefore fehbas preemption provision may fail to withstand constitutional scrutiny unless fehbaauthorized contracts themselves are laws of the united states they are not law connotes a policy imposed by the government not a privatelynegotiated contract mcveigh  fd at — emphasis added citing am airlines inc v wolens  us   n   finding that the word series law rule regulation standard or other provision  as used in a federal statute connotes official governmentimposed policies not the terms of a private contract see also mcveigh  fd at  sack j concurring it seems to me to be possible notwithstanding that analysis that the statute is unavoidably unconstitutional because contract terms are not laws of the united states that are the supreme law of the land the supreme court subsequently affirmed the second circuit empire healthchoice assur inc v mcveigh  us     though the court ultimately parried the constitutionality of the benefits acts contractual preemption provision it nevertheless characterized the provision as an unusual order warranting cautious interpretation and noted that if congress intends a preemption instruction completely to displace ordinarily applicable state law and to confer federal jurisdiction thereby it may be expected to make that atypical intention clear id at  returning to the issue recently the supreme court found that congress did indeed intend preemption subject to specific unambiguous restrictions coventry health care of missouri inc v nevils  s ct    pursuant to explicit congressional intent contracts under the benefits act preempt state law to the extent that they relate to the nature provision or extent of coverage or benefits   in finding contractual preemption in that instance constitutional the court explained that any distinction between contractual and statutory preemption merely elevates semantics over substance because the statute explicitly authorized contractual preemption under certain conditions id at  that holding and the similar discussion in mcveigh highlight the absence of similar authority here and underscore the importance of congressional intent where federal preemption is asserted absent such authority no preemption can exist accordingly to the extent that congress did not explicitly authorize the use agreements contractual preemption of local rent regulation and to the extent that the court finds that the procedure leading to the use agreements preemption was procedurally defective under the administrative procedure act federal preemption concluded on the date that authorized preemption endedon december   after owner prepaid the mortgage and after the use agreement had been signedfn thus because owners only argument for the inapplicability of local rent regulation is preemption by federal law because owner does not deny the acceptance of j subsidies and more importantly because there is no dispute that the rent stabilization law applies to new york city apartments in buildings constructed prior to  with at least six rental units rsl §  local rent regulation applies to the subject units accordingly the court grants plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on their first cause of action and declares the rsl applicable from december   onwards iii second cause of action — rent overcharge to the extent that the court holds above that the procedure and substance underpinning the use agreements contractual preemption was invalid and therefore that the building was subject to the local rent stabilization law as of the date of the mortgages prepayment december   the branch of owners motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims for rent overcharges must be denied moreover there remains an issue of fact with respect to whether any overcharging was willful as required to for treble damages accordingly summary judgment on this cause of action is denied iv third cause of action — general business law §h gbl § h provides that any person who has been injured by reason of any violation of this section may bring an action in his own name to enjoin such unlawful act or practice an action to recover his actual damages or fifty dollars whichever is greater or both such actions the court may in its discretion increase the award of damages to an amount not to exceed three times the actual damages up to one thousand dollars if the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this section the court may award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing plaintiffhowever to the extent that a dispute is between a landlord and tenants and not consumeroriented conduct aimed at the public at large such cases are properly dismissed aguaiza v vantage properties llc  add   st dept   to the extent that plaintiffs opposition to this argument is limited to a onesentence conclusory allegation that factual questions remain this is insufficient to create any issue of fact accordingly plaintiffs third cause of action is dismissed v fourth cause of action — compliance with hud handbook as plaintiffs note owner makes competing arguments that the building is regulated by hud through the use agreement which contemplates federal preemption but should not be held to compliance with the hud handbook because the building is not a subsidized project within the meaning of § d to the extent that the parties agree that the building is not subject to federal regulation with respect to the hud handbook and to the extent that the court holds above that owners mortgage prepayment ended the buildings status as a subsidized property subject to federal regulation there is no basis to enforce compliance with the hud handbook accordingly owners motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs fourth cause of action is granted conclusion based on the foregoing it is hereby ordered that defendants motion for summary judgment on the first and second causes of action is denied and it is further ordered and adjudged that plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the first cause of action is granted to the extent that the court finds that the subject property was subject to the rent stabilization law as of december   and it is further ordered that defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs second cause of action is denied and it is further ordered that defendants motion for summary judgment on the third and fourth causes of action is granted and said causes of action shall be dismissed and it is further ordered that plaintiffs shall within  days of entry serve a copy of this order with notice of entry upon all parties this constitutes the decision and order of the court dated july  new york nycarol r edmead jsc footnotes footnote  owner aff refers to the affidavit of sinclair haberman an authorized member of owner the relationship between the two habermans is unclear footnote  pl affirm refers to the affirmation of jason wu counsel for plaintiffs footnote  only an unsigned copy of the amended financial assistance contract exists but neither party disputes its applicability or authenticity owner exhs g h footnote  the above described use agreement refers to the use agreement footnote  as discussed below the relevant issue is the formation and content of the use agreement itself and particularly the preemption clause to that end the parties do not dispute that plaintiffs first notice of the use agreement came after the agreement had already been signed in  indeed owners reply affirmation confirms that a meeting took place on april   at which hud representatives jennifer laurie a nonparty tenant advocate and tenantplaintiff hiram chapman were present owner reply aff chapman reply aff ¶  laurie reply aff ¶  moreover nowhere does owner assert that plaintiffs learned of the use agreements preemption clause at that meeting and there is no indication that the meeting was meant to discuss anything other than rent increases additionally the recertification notices allegedly delivered to all building tenants by owner bear no mention of the use agreement itself owner reply aff exh c thus to the extent that the parties dispute service of income recertification notices pursuant to the use agreement this issue is not germane to the courts determination footnote  exhibit l is by owners own characterization a ninepage sixtynine item representative lease but not one signed by any plaintiff there is no indication that a copy of the use agreement was attached to this lease or any other footnote  for this reason the court rejects at the outset owners argument that the dhcr opinion letter afforded the use agreement any preemptive effect footnote  to the extent that owner cites the dhcr opinion letter as evidence of huds authority to enter the agreement dhcr cannot grant
