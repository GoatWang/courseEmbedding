public service electric  gas company  turnkey utility project learning library pseg howell street substationthe example of a successful turnkey utility project tweet conference paper resource management  by shvartsberg boris how to cite this article shvartsberg b  pseg howell street substation—the example of a successful turnkey utility project paper presented at pmi® global congress —north america denver co newtown square pa project management institute abstract all modern utility companies have experienced a shortage of finding a qualified internal workforce so they look for staff augmentation through outsourcing this paper details how the public service electric  gas company pseg of new jersey used a “turnkey” approach to build the new  kv howell street substation topics discussed include expectations versus realities problems discovered and solutions developed lessons learned etc these topics may be help others be more successful in their own turnkey projects introduction one of the biggest challenges faced by the modern utility industry all over the world is a lack of qualified inhouse resources when an experienced member of the workforce retires it is difficult to find a replacement the main reason is the loss of attractiveness for new employees to work for a utility company electric gas etc because of the companies continuously cutting on benefits pay pension etc so long gone are good old times when utility companies could do all the work by themselves relying on the internal engineering design construction and project management resources there is more work than  years ago and a less qualified workforce to do it as a result a common trend in the modern utility industry is outsourcing one of the most popular project delivery options based on outsourcing is a “turnkey” or “designbuild” or “engineer procure construct epc” approach where the owner utility company hires the outside contractor to perform a certain work eg construction of new or modernization of existing facilities covering all project phases design construction testing commissioning etc ideally the owner should decide what the company wants get a contractor to implement this wish and then take the final product and use it however it is never that simple successful outsourcing requires a specific experience that most companies do not have as a result they may have unfulfilled expectations about the quality of the delivered product cost schedule etc there are many typical obstructions that should be overcome by both the owner and contractor to make a turnkey project a success to make this learning process shorter hopefully for others public service electric  gas company pseg of new jersey wants to share its experience in a successful application of a turnkey approach for the new  kv howell street substation their experience includes lessons learned problems discovered and solutions developed background in  pseg celebrated its th anniversary since it has been in business for that long it has a number of buildings and facilities that are  years old or older these facilities are still serving customers but they need to be replaced or upgraded the old howell street substation was one of these facilities built in  it had obsolete equipment that was prone to failure exhibit  shows the old howell street substation exhibit  the old howell street substation when a roadwidening project in the area required relocation of a howell street substation a decision was made to build a new stateofthe art facility on available pseg property it required the company to switch load from the old station to a new station and demolish the old facility because of the apparent simplicity of the task lack of interaction with any other facilities and its relatively small size the project was considered to be a good candidate for a turnkey approach to start the process a request for proposal was sent to several reputable turnkey vendors it included a specification describing the new substation’s arrangement equipment characteristics approved vendors to procure this equipment from as well as a oneline schematic and conceptual arrangement drawing the overall scope included a  kv substation consisting of three incoming  kv circuits two  kv  mva transformers and seven outgoing  kv circuits the control systems included stateoftheart microprocessor relays and instruments after being energized the new substation was supposed to provide power supply to about  industrial and residential customers in jersey city nj after lump sum bid proposals were received and evaluated by pseg personnel a purchase order was placed with the successful bidder to build the whole substation in  months which was acceptable because a roadwidening project was scheduled to start in two years the rest of the story is presented as a list of owner’s expectations realities and lessons learned that covered various areas of the project learning process  expectation because this is a turnkey project involvement of pseg personnel will be minimal reality in order to ensure acceptability of the final product the project had to be closely monitored by pseg engineers designers construction supervisors etc during the whole project life cycle which resulted in significant additional personnel time spent this extra time amounted to almost  of the time that would be needed if the owner did all the work lesson learned turnkey does not mean “free from the owner’s involvement” the project budget should include sufficient funds to cover the owner’s effort to support the project depending on the nature of the project and previous experience with a particular turnkey vendor these extra funds may be higher or lower but they are always needed  expectation the company’s technical requirements are pretty standard they are not different from what other utility companies want for a straightforward substation project a decent specification explaining major requirements should be sufficient for an experienced turnkey contractor to provide a quality product reality the range of possible technical solutions for the same project is very wide while all of them are safe and working pseg operational and maintenance personnel are very strict in their specific requirements on how things should work and will not accept anything that deviates from their practices including a turnkey vendor’s interpretation of the initial specification’s requirements this problem was discovered during design reviews and rectified but the solution came with a hefty price tag because the vendor’s original bid proposal was based on the vendor’s understanding of the owner’s wishes anything that was not spelled out in the specification but requested by the owner later led to change orders and additional expenses on this particular project a total of  change orders were issued with a total cost about  of the original bid price the majority of these change orders was a result of the differences between what the owner meant and how a vendor understood the task lesson learned the owner’s specification should be very thorough and state all the requirements even if they are minor it should include the operation and maintenance personnel’s input as well any extra time spent to make a request for proposal clearer will pay off eventually by reducing the amount of future change orders  expectation it is easy to manage time and cost for a turnkey project completion date is guaranteed by the vendor final cost is easily predictable because there is a lump sum contract with the vendor reality any changes requested by the owner will lead not only to a cost increase to cover change orders but to possible delays as well because a vendor based the schedule on a different scope lesson learned contingency funds and time buffers should be included in a project budget and schedule respectively to compensate for a possible cost increase and time delays for a turnkey project in the case of the howell street substation pseg created a financial reserve in the amount of  of the base budget and a sixmonth long time reserve anticipating surprises in their first turnkey experience both of these measures proved to be critical for a successful project  expectation it is easier for the utility company’s project manager to manage a turnkey project because this person is dealing with a single point of contact—a vendor’s project manager  reality while spending less time on cost time and communication management the owner’s project manager is getting much more involved in scope and contract management because of a necessity to control and monitor the vendor’s performance adherence to scope change order requests etc by no means does the owner’s project manager works less in a turnkey environment than in the past this project manager just has additional new responsibilities which in many cases may require an additional learning lesson learned the utility company has to provide a strong project manager to support turnkey projects to ensure that the owner’s interests are protected if the personnel is lacking knowledge and experience in the specific areas critical for a turnkey project management adequate training should be provided end result it took almost two years for pseg to have its first turnkey project completed there were some completely unexpected delays for example after a vendor finished pile driving pseg construction personnel raised the concern about the quality of work performed the only way to address this concern was to test some piles randomly testing proved that while the type of piles chosen by the vendor and the technique used to drive them differed from pseg practices a quality of work was acceptable unfortunately work was stopped for two months while pile testing was performed which led to delays and additional expenses another unexpected delay was associated with a ready for service substation’s acceptance by pseg maintenance and operational personnel at least four preenergization walkthrough meetings were conducted to address the continuously raised concerns and punchlist items however eventually the substation was accepted and energized the final product is shown in the exhibit  after the new station was placed in service the old one was demolished exhibit  the new howell street substation conclusion overall the first pseg experience with a turnkey project was successful a new substation was placed in service and the old one was demolished before the start of a roadwidening project the full project scope was implemented while the total cost remained below an approved budget therefore the classic “triple constraint” project management institute pmi  p  was fully met besides that pseg obtained valuable experience in using a turnkey project delivery approach all the howell street project lessons learned should make any future outsourcing experience even more rewarding another benefit from the work on the howell street project was an opportunity to establish good working relationships with a turnkey vendor who received more knowledge about pseg’s engineering and construction standards and practices after completing his work on the project as a result this vendor was successfully used by pseg on several more projects and remains to be one of a few “vendors of choice” for a future turnkey work project management institute  a guide to the project management body of knowledge pmbok® guide third edition
