appear in a form q that a trust is required to report has been and will continue to be reported on a form k as set forth above ii analysis certification of disclosure in companies quarterly and annual reports under section  of the sarbanesoxley act principal executive and financial officers are required to certify information contained in an issuers quarterly and annual reports in recognition of the difficulties assetbacked issuers would have in complying with the rules established for certification of quarterly and annual reports the division of corporation finance released a statement on august   and a revised statement on february   providing guidance to assetbacked issuers regarding the certification requirements specific issues regarding certification of periodic reports by the depositor the obligations of the depositor and the trustee in relation to the trust certificates are fairly simple and their involvement in the administration of the trust and the trust assets is largely passive as a result and as described below we request written confirmation that the use of the proposed form of certification attached to this letter would be acceptable for the purpose of compliance by the depositor with its obligations under section  of the sarbanesoxley act and exchange act rules a and d the information included by the depositor in its exchange act reports is limited to the information described above under the heading background  basis of exchange act reporting for the depositor  form k in addition in circumstances where the underlying securities issuer ceases to file exchange act reports the trustee either distributes the underlying securities to the trust certificateholders or liquidates the underlying securities and distributes the proceeds to trust certificateholders as specified in the trust agreement furthermore we note that paragraph  of the proposed form of certification included in revised corp fin statement re compliance by assetbacked issuers with exchange act rules a and d assumes that an independent public accountant conducts a review of the servicers compliance with its obligations there is no requirement in the trust agreements for the preparation of a report by an independent public accountant regarding the depositors compliance with its obligations therefore we propose that paragraph  will not be included in the certification for any trust that does not require the preparation of such reports if independent public accountants reports are required for future trusts we would propose the preparation of examination reports prepared by an independent public accountant in compliance with established or stated criteria as set forth in the professional standards of the american institute of certified public accountants this is consistent with the sec staffs position in a letter issued to coopers  lybrand llp dated march   iii conclusion based on the above analysis we request that you provide written confirmation that the depositors approach to the reporting requirements of the exchange act is acceptable and that the following certification would be acceptable for the purpose of compliance by the depositor with section  of the sarbanesoxley act and exchange act rules a and d including confirmation that the term similar agreement in the proposed form of certification would include the agreements that set out the rights and obligations of the parties involved in the transactions described in this letter  the words or similar procedure in paragraph  of the proposed form of certification would include an examination report prepared by an independent public accountant in compliance with established or stated criteria as set forth in the professional standards of the american institute of certified public accountants  i identify the certifying individual certify that i have reviewed this annual report on form k and all reports on form k containing distribution or
