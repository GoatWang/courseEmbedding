are subject to change and are not buysell recommendations fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet  about risk allocation risk the fund’s investment performance depends in part on how its assets are allocated among the underlying funds or asset classes the adviser’s evaluations and assumptions regarding the asset classes or the underlying funds in which the fund invests may be incorrect causing the fund to be invested or not invested in one or more asset classes or underlying funds at an inopportune time which could negatively affect the fund’s performance depositary receipts risk investing in depositary receipts involve the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities in addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts an underlying fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay an underlying fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in an underlying fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make an underlying fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and an underlying fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which an underlying fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact an underlying fund’s ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions dividend paying security risk securities that pay high dividends as a group can fall out of favor with the market causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay high dividends also changes in the dividend policies of the companies in an underlying fund’s underlying index and the capital resources available for such companies’ dividend payments may affect an underlying fund emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information exchangetraded fund industry concentration risk in following its methodology an underlying exchangetraded fund’s underlying index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or sector to the extent that an underlying fund’s underlying index concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector an underlying fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent by concentrating its investments in an industry or sector an underlying fund faces more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors such industrybased risks any of which may adversely affect the companies in which an underlying fund invests may include but are not limited to the following general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry competition for resources adverse labor relations political or world events obsolescence of technologies and increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry in addition at times such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries or the market as a whole exchangetraded funds risk in addition to the risks associated with the underlying assets held by the exchangetraded fund investments in exchangetraded funds are subject to the following additional risks  an exchangetraded fund’s shares may trade above or below its net asset value  an active trading market for the exchangetraded fund’s shares may not develop or be maintained  trading an exchangetraded fund’s shares may be halted by the listing exchange  a passivelymanaged exchangetraded fund may not track the performance of the reference asset and  a passively managed exchangetraded fund may hold troubled securities investment in exchangetraded funds may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses as the fund or an underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses paid by the exchangetraded funds in which it invests further certain exchangetraded funds in which the fund or an underlying fund may invest are leveraged which may result in economic leverage permitting the fund or an underlying fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the case in an unlevered instrument and potentially resulting in greater volatility financial services sector risk an underlying fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions foreign securities risk an underlying fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless an underlying fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which an underlying fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful fund of funds risk the fund’s performance depends on that of the underlying funds in which it invests accordingly the risks associated with an investment in the fund include the risks associated with investments in the underlying funds the fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests there are risks that the fund will vary from its target weightings if any in the underlying funds that the underlying funds will not achieve their investment objectives that the underlying funds’ performance may be lower than their represented asset classes and that the fund may withdraw its investments in an underlying fund at a disadvantageous time geographic focus risk an underlying fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries adverse economic political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on an underlying fund’s investment performance growth investing risk growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing company’s earnings or assets compared with other types of stock as a result they tend to be more sensitive to changes in or investors’ expectations of the issuing company’s earnings and can be more volatile indexing risk an underlying fund is operated as a passively managed index fund and therefore the adverse performance of a particular security necessarily will not result in the elimination of the security from the underlying fund’s portfolio ordinarily the underlying fund’s adviser will not sell the underlying fund’s portfolio securities except to reflect additions or deletions of the securities that comprise the underlying fund’s underlying index or as may be necessary to raise cash to pay underlying fund shareholders who sell underlying fund shares as such the underlying fund will be negatively affected by declines in the securities represented by its underlying index also there is no guarantee that the underlying fund’s adviser will be able to correlate the underlying fund’s performance with that of its underlying index investing in the european union risk investments in certain countries in the european union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with high levels of debt such as investments in sovereign debt of greece italy and spain separately the european union faces issues involving its membership structure procedures and policies the exit of one or more member states from the european union would place its currency and banking system in jeopardy efforts of the member states to further unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the downward movement of one member state’s market to cause a similar effect on other member states’ markets management risk an underlying fund is actively managed and depends heavily on an underlying fund’s adviser’s judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for an underlying fund’s portfolio an underlying fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of an underlying fund and therefore the ability of the underlying fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of an underlying fund’s investments and therefore the value of an underlying fund’s shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by an underlying fund will rise in value market trading risk an underlying exchangetraded fund faces numerous market trading risks including the potential lack of an active market for its shares losses from trading in secondary markets and disruption in the creationredemption process of an underlying fund any of these factors may lead to an underlying fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to an underlying fund’s net asset value nav nondiversification risk an underlying fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can a change in the value of one or a few issuers’ securities will therefore affect the value of an underlying fund more than would occur in a diversified fund preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer sampling risk an underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling approach will result in its holding a smaller number of securities than are in its underlying index and in the underlying fund holding securities not included in its underlying index as a result an adverse development respecting an issuer of securities held by the underlying fund could result in a greater decline in the underlying fund’s nav than would be the case if all of the securities in its underlying index were held an underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling approach may also include the risk that it may not track the return of its underlying index as well as it would have if the underlying fund held all of the securities in its underlying index sector focus risk an underlying fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets ie over  in one market sector or group of related industries in this event an underlying fund’s performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that an underlying fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries small and midcapitalization companies risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies’ securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market unique economic and political risks of investing in greater china investments in companies located or operating in greater china involve risks not associated with investments in western nations such as nationalization expropriation or confiscation of property difficulty in obtaining andor enforcing judgments alteration or discontinuation of economic reforms military conflicts either internal or with other countries inflation currency fluctuations and fluctuations in inflation and interest rates that may have negative effects on the economy and securities markets of greater china and greater china’s dependency on the economies of other asian countries many of which are developing countries events in any one country within greater china may impact the other countries in the region or greater china as a whole additionally developing countries such as those in greater china may subject an underlying fund’s investments to a number of tax rules and the application of many of those rules may be uncertain moreover china has implemented a number of tax reforms in recent years and may amend or revise its existing tax laws andor procedures in the future possibly with retroactive effect changes in applicable chinese tax law could reduce the aftertax profits of an underlying fund directly or indirectly including by reducing the aftertax profits of companies in china in which an underlying fund invests uncertainties in chinese tax rules could result in unexpected tax liabilities for an underlying fund value investing style risk a value investing style subjects an underlying fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market as of  ainyx nav change    nas may appear until data is available
