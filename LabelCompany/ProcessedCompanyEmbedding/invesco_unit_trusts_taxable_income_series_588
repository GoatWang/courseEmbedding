legal status and documentsedit a uit may be constituted as either a regulated investment company ric or a grantor trust a ric is a trust corporation or partnership in which investors have common investment and voting rights but do not have direct interest in investments of the investment company or fund a grantor trust in contrast grants investors proportional ownership in the underlying securities a uit is created by a document called the trust indenture this document is drafted by the sponsor of the fund and names the trustee and the evaluator by us law the sponsor and the trustee may not be the same the sponsor selects and assembles the securities to be included in the fund the trustee keeps the securities maintains unitholder records and performs all accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio the largest issuer of uits is first trust portfolios other sponsors include incapital smarttrust invesco unit trusts millington securities advisors asset management and guggenheim funds most large brokerage firms such as merrill lynch and lpl financial sell uits created by these sponsors tax perspectiveedit from a tax perspective uits offer a shelter from the unrealized capital gains taxes typical inside of a mutual fund because individual uits are assembled and purchased for specific periods of time the cost basis consists of the initial purchase price of the securities held in the trust a mutual fund on the other hand taxes the individual based on the entire previous tax year regardless of the date purchased an investor could for example purchase a mutual fund in october absorb a loss during the last quarter of the year and yet still be taxed on capital gains within the fund depending on the overall performance of the underlying securities from january  of the current year a uit avoids this potential tax consequence by assembling an entirely new investment for each individual investor some exchangetraded funds etfs are technically classified as uits however etfs usually do not have set portfolios they are either managed or update automatically to follow an index and can have lifetimes of over  years for example the spdr sp  trust is scheduled to terminate january   and the powershares qqq trust is scheduled to terminate march   see alsoedit collective investment scheme mutual fund stockbroker brokerage firm referencesedit  lemke
