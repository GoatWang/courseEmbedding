raymondblockedunblockfollowfollowingwriter and volleyball husband forever a coach and a teacher fan of horse racing ncaa volleyball and mlb live in the twin cities• acts jul  how to alienate a horseplayeran update two years laterjuly i ran my canterbury park mvp card through the shredder i am on day  of boycotting my home track the place where i was introduced to horse racing some eight or nine years ago while the canterbury park track personnel were celebrating their new partnership with mystic lake casino i was busy evaluating new tracks where i could shift my bankrollthe last two years canterbury had pushed for legislation that would allow the horse track to add slots like so many other racetracks they were looking for revenue from gaming to fuel their dying horse racing industry mystic lake casino owned and operated by the shakopee mdewakanton sioux community is literally down the street from canterbury it became a battle of lobbyist the two parties shocked everyone and reached a historic agreement pretty much mystic lake gained sponsorship opportunities at canterbury and peace of mind knowing there would not be competition down the street canterbury gained  million dispersed over a ten year period an obvious boost to pursesmy problem arose because i could not reserve my regular clubhouse table on the big day of racing for the  meet the reservation was being made well in advance but i was informed that all the clubhouse tables were reserved for tribal personnel i the diehard horseplayer had been placed on the backburner almost a decade of wagering on the product and now my clubhouse seat had been sold to the highest bidder i would have accepted that the event had sold out instead i was told that no one can reserve clubhouse seating on that day as all seating is being held for tribal personnel and sponsors canterbury park sent me a clear message that my dollars wagered on their product and my enthusiastic support of their brand in the social media world did not matter after years of attending live racing and wagering on the product i distanced myself from the racetrack it appeared canterbury had no interest in pleasing the horseplayerpresent daythe agreement between mystic lake and canterbury park significantly increased purses for horse racing i could see that two years ago it was a business decision it was the best decision they had available now we see larger fields bigger purses and some big name horses and jockeys that come to canterbury park for the featured daysin  canterbury park ranked th in the hana track ratings the  edition showed the shakopee track at number  that’s a notable increase especially in an era where tracks are slipping while casino money has given new mexico horse racing a boost in purses most of their tracks are still in the bottom of hana’s track ratings the same could be said about parx penn national mountaineer and others slots money alone does not solve the issues large fields low takeouts and a quality racing product appeal to horseplayers attracting and satisfying horseplayers are the keys to increasing the handle and when handle goes up life at the track is better for everyonedespite my boycott of canterbury in  they began to do things to attract the horseplayer maybe i had been bumped for tribal personnel and sponsors but it was just one day what canterbury did in  and  with a low  takeout on a  cent pick  made horseplayers happy the mystic lake agreement boosted purses larger purses brought some new barns but more importantly it brought larger fields and large fields and low takeout are the things that make a track stand out in the hana track ratings hana  track ratings reported that the canterbury handle had increased  the  track ratings show an incredible  increase in handle so despite one frustrated horseplayer from two years ago the handle at canterbury park keeps going up and that is maybe the most important statistic in the racing businessjuly i sit in the comfort of the onehorsestable home office and follow live horse racing via twinspires this is not the s i have no need for a live racing product in my backyard i don’t need canterbury park’s simulcast center or a local otb thanks to a laptop and a high speed internet connection i have ample opportunities to wager on horse racing why don’t racetracks realize that horseplayers have options i can move my money to tracks with the best racing the lowest takeout the biggest fields or whatever i choose since my boycott of canterbury park i have been able to focus heavily on the final days of racing at indiana downs harness racing at balmoral and my usual steady diet of arlington park to modify a quote from the hana harness blog “you may have certain tracks where you do better than others and you can’t ignore that but when all else is equal horseplayers need to be looking for the best deal and the tracks that cater to the horseplayers”in all fairness the canterbury park twitter account responded promptly and engaged with me to address my unhappiness we exchanged emails and the person behind the account promised a resolution by the end of the day despite the noble efforts of this track employee the answer i received was the same information i heard over the phone initially  no i cannot reserve any seat in the clubhouse level  everything is reserved for tribal personnel and sponsors and  you can put your name on a waiting listi wanted to shout “waiting list don’t you know who i am” but i didn’t and in reality my wagering will have little impact on their handle i just thought they cared more about their handicappers a canterbury employee named andrew went above and beyond to try and help this disgruntled horseplayer have a seat for the big day several people contacted me throughout the month of july i am sure they were limited in what they could actually offer me in the end they did offer me a table after all the tribal personnel and sponsors had been accounted for they called me about a table that was available i declined but i appreciated the effortpresent daymy boycott lasted from july  until the day of the wood memorial in april  no live racing and no simulcast center for me all my wagering went through my adw account the boycott ended because canterbury is my favorite place to be there is nothing my wife and i enjoy in the twin cities more than live racing at canterbury and the simulcast center is my second home i love being there on dark days in the fall and spring to play other meets dubai world cup day is one of my favorite days and i love being at canterbury to bet those races like all good boycotts it had to come to an end i wanted to watch and wager on the wood memorial and i wanted to spend the day at one of my favorite places i have been back at my regular clubhouse table ever since i had to get a new mvp card since i shredded the other one but it was good to be backsummarymaryland jockey club president tom chuckas said “the money that comes to the racing industry from gaming is basically a state grant and the purpose is to get our industry back in line and to get it back where it should be” though the scenario in minnesota was different than maryland the principle is the same canterbury needs to look at the mystic lake agreement as a way to get racing back on track the money may not last forever i still think canterbury should pay more attention to the horseplayers everything seems geared to the  per race player and not the horseplayer but the agreement has brought larger fields the track listened to handicappers when it implemented a  cent pick  with a low  takeout and large fields and low takeout are two things that every horseplayer loveslast year it was clear what impact the mystic lake agreement had made on horse racing in minnesota on the day of the mystic lake mile our little track hosted some big names mike stidham chris block miguel mena mike maker ken and sarah ramsey chris landeros louie roussel and chris block those were some of the connections represented that never would have happened before but i hope canterbury heeds the advice of tom chuckas chuckas said “anybody that looks at it that this is free money or will be here until the end of time i think they’re making a serious mistake… we should be using that money to build our business and put us in a position that if it lessens or even goes away that we can survive”“the goal wasn’t casino” canterbury park’s randy sampson said back in  “the goal was horse racing — making horse racing successful this absolutely does that” two years later with large fields bigger purses and a feature race that attracts big name connections indeed it has but in the meantime build the business don’t alienate the horseplayers keep them happy put yourself in a position so that you can survive if the the slots revenue dries up in pennsylvania put yourself in a position so that you can survive when the mystic lake agreement ends one day make sure you still have the horseplayers it is this group of people that you always want to appeal to day in and day out year in and year outabout the authorscott raymond
