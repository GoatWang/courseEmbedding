calendar trd events trd info about us advertising careers the real deal new york june  issue marc holliday the man at the helm of nyc’s largest commercial landlord by hiten samtani  june   am marc holliday last month sl green realty corp ceo marc holliday flew a group of his key executives and top new york brokers to louisville for the kentucky derby where holliday’s horse love train ran in an undercard race the threeyearold filly didn’t place at churchill downs but holliday’s blue devil racing stable has had a strong run with some  million in winnings to date according to thoroughbred racing site equibase that windfall comes as no surprise to top real estate attorney robert ivanhoe who counts the sl green head as a longtime friend and client whether it’s horseracing or real estate holliday “just has incredible judgment and instinct about how to make money” ivanhoe said since holliday joined sl green  years ago the company has mushroomed from a midsize landlord into a publicly traded behemoth now new york city’s largest commercial property owner sl green has roughly  billion in gross asset value according to data from sandler o’neill  partners sl green’s portfolio encompasses more than  million square feet of office properties including such prized assets as the  millionsquarefoot one astor plaza at  broadway the squarefoot  lexington avenue the graybar building at  lexington avenue and the news building at  east nd street in recent years sl green has surged ahead of its competitors including the once seemingly invincible vornado realty trust with an aggressive strategy that combines acquisition and leasing of properties with mezzanine financing sl green was the only new york–focused reit to outperform both the msci us reit index — a market capitalization index that represents  percent of the country’s reits — and the sp  index in the first quarter also in the first three months of the year sl green signed manhattan lease deals totaling nearly  square feet including  square feet of space at  fifth avenue and  square feet at  park avenue and at the time of the reit’s april earnings call the reit had nearly  million square feet of deals in the pipeline these days as one real estate insider put it sl green “eats vornado’s lunch” holliday took over for firm founder stephen green in  and industry players and analysts credit him — and the ferociously competitive culture he’s instilled at sl green — with the reit’s rapid ascent “we take it almost personally when it comes to retaining tenants and getting opportunities at the right price” holliday told the real deal in a rare phone interview to his peers holliday is a talented negotiator able to deftly balance aggression and fairness to come away with the spoils jared kushner “he’s a winwin guy” jared kushner ceo of kushner companies and a former intern at sl green said of holliday “he understands how to make a good deal for himself and he understands that you’ve got to let the other person make a good deal too” all in the family new york real estate is renowned for its dynasties and holliday like many in the field has strong family ties to the industry holliday’s maternal grandfather george goldberg was a prominent owner of real estate in brooklyn and his father morton holliday was a managing director at real estate financing company sonnenblickgoldman in the s “mort holliday was doing the biggest deals in new york in those days” recalled james kuhn president of newmark grubb knight frank of his son morton holliday said “real estate was always in his genes” “like any father i gave him the benefit of my experience and advice” he added and “many of my clients are now marc’s clients” the younger holliday grew up in the wealthy town of huntington on the north shore of long island and was the starting goalie on the huntington high school lacrosse team his father said the family took frequent trips to the thoroughbred track in saratoga springs ny where holliday developed his love of horseracing these days he shares that love with his wife sheree a competitive rider in  holliday graduated from columbia university’s graduate real estate development program and went to work at the private real estate investment bank capital trust ivanhoe who first met holliday around that time recalls being “extremely impressed” with the young man especially with his skill in structured finance back then the real estate landscape was undergoing a sea change with mortgages beginning to be “securitized” or converted into securities that investors could purchase to cope with that increased complexity real estate bosses looked to wall street the most highprofile of these hires came in  when vornado’s steven roth lured capital markets dynamo michael fascitelli from goldman sachs fascitelli’s hire signaled that real estate industry players would now be “unsentimental not good ol’ boys but young tough boys” said kenneth patton the onetime coo of helmsleyspear and a longtime professor at nyu schack institute of real estate these newcomers ushering in a new level of intensity in the industry would “kill fight and pillage to make their shareholders value” holliday was green’s answer to fascitelli green had founded sl green properties in  acquiring and upgrading class b buildings on side streets by the s the company had a  million portfolio and was gearing up to go public from left andrew mathias marc holliday and stephen green credit steve friedman green hired the thirtysomething holliday — on the recommendation of ivanhoe his attorney and golf buddy — as chief investment officer in  with the intention of grooming him to take over “i was a big early fan of the securitization market and the positive impact it could have on institutional real estate” holliday said describing green as a “visionary” for “seeing the potential of a wall street approach to growing a real estate platform” green quickly became holliday’s mentor for years in the late s the two met once a week for breakfast at the royalton hotel on west th street crafting an ambitious vision for the future of sl green “all i ever had on me at the time was my wall street journal and a pen” recalled holliday “we’d pencil out the business plan and adapt it weektoweek” when green stepped down as ceo in  he “very happily turned over the reins” to holliday ivanhoe said indeed when sl green visited the new york stock exchange last year to celebrate the reit’s th anniversary the tall leonine green sounded the gavel but the stockier holliday was front and center “steve has three sons and none of them went into his business” ivanhoe said adding that green takes “enormous pride” in holliday’s success taking charge almost immediately holliday began having an impact at sl green first he spearheaded efforts to “go after big buildings on the avenues” ivanhoe said rather than the smaller class b buildings that made up the bulk of the firm’s portfolio up to that point the mcgrawhill building in december  for example sl green paid  million for a  percent stake in the mcgrawhill building at  sixth avenue seven years later the reit sold its stake to the canada pension plan investment board for roughly  million according to costar in making acquisitions such as these holliday displays a foresight reminiscent of his father ngkf’s kuhn said “before the market got really hot sl green won a lot of buildings by being the highest bidder” kuhn recalled “i asked marc ‘do you think you overpaid’ he replied ‘i would rather overpay today at  a foot than three years later at  a foot’” holliday also led the creation of a structured finance capability at the reit ivanhoe said which allowed sl green to convert missed acquisition opportunities such as the young  rubicam building at  madison avenue into lucrative financing deals though aby rosen’s rfr realty bought the property for  million in late  sl green had a finger in the pie by giving rfr a bridge loan and at  church street where the sapir organization in  defaulted on its  million senior mezzanine loan issued by gramercy capital then a sl green subsidiary sl green moved to take control of the financial district property when the reit took over the building was barely  percent leased but by october  it was  percent occupied “they completely turned the asset around” ivanhoe said sl green’s structured finance acumen combined with its leasing expertise allowed the company to forge “an identity” in the market patton said that and the competitive culture instilled by holliday earlier this year sl green bid on the sony building at  madison avenue but lost out to developers joseph chetrit and david bistricer ivanhoe who was representing chetrit and bistricer recalls being cornered at a party by several eager sl green executives “they asked ‘did the other bidder win’” ivanhoe said “when i nodded they said ‘ok we have the asset underwritten do they have the loan yet’ i think they used words like ‘lock and load’” joseph chetrit and  madison avenue credit propertyshark by the end of the next day there was a signed contract for sl green to arrange  million in financing for chetrit and bistricer’s  billion acquisition one of the largest deals in manhattan office history “the new york market is not forgiving with time” holliday said of the deal summing up sl green’s überaggressive approach that ethos of hard work and long hours several people familiar with the company said is embraced by holliday’s top lieutenants including president andrew mathias cochief investment officers david schonbraun and isaac zion and leasing director steven durels “no one will outwork marc holliday and sl green” said ivanhoe adding that the reit’s employees are fully aware of that expectation “the message is unless you’re willing to get on that train and you’re up for all of that go somewhere else” for example entertainment giant viacom’s  millionsquarefoot renewal and expansion at sl green’s  broadway in april of last year was a result of a weeklong series of roundtheclock meetings “they were literally hour meetings with phone calls to each side’s ceo waking them up in the middle of the night at  o’clock in the morning with new issues” durels told the new york observer of the deal mathias a wharton graduate who followed holliday from capital trust to sl green shortly after it went public is particularly crucial to holliday’s team industry sources said mathias is “quiet and lowkey” ivanhoe said in contrast to the “more effusive and outgoing” ceo “we’re sort of alter egos” holliday said of his secondincommand perhaps more importantly the two share a reputation for integrity several sources said holliday and mathias are among “the few guys in new york city whose handshake really means something” said robert “large loan” verrone founder of real estate financing company iron hound management who represented the chetrit group in sourcing the sony building loan “they really go out of their way to take care of the relationship” in  sl green played the role of a white knight at joseph moinian’s prized  columbus circle a story squarefoot tower at  broadway moinian had been battling default at the tower which was reportedly only  percent occupied at the end of  in a bid to wrest the property from him the related companies bought a  million note on the property “joe was going to have a very hard time refinancing in a limited capital market” said kuhn who was involved in leasing the building “he brought in marc and sl green paid off the loan and ended up controlling the property” a few months later sl green nabbed advertising giant young  rubicam as an anchor tenant at the tower moinian told trd that the  columbus deal was “beautifully leased beautifully done” “i can write a book about marc” he added singling out holliday’s ability to “skin a cat in many ways he is not only very positive but he has a route a route b and route c” despite its successes though sl green has made its share of mistakes under holliday — most notably a  mezzanine financing investment in stuyvesant town–peter cooper village sl green invested  million in tishman speyer and blackrock realty’s  billion acquisition of the immense apartment complex in  with the property at the center of a controversy over rentstabilized housing the owners defaulted on their loans and handed over the keys to creditors leaving sl green with heavy losses other people’s money though sl green is known best for its office projects holliday has shown a knack for retail development too the reit has partnered with retail czar jeff sutton on marquee retail projects such as  broadway and a building portfolio on fifth and madison avenues both deals viewed in the industry as unqualified successes jeff sutton at  broadway for example sl green and sutton in  paid the riese organization what was considered an exorbitant  million for the landmarked squarefoot building but by striking a lease deal at neighboring  broadway which allowed the two properties to be combined the partnership managed to effectively triple the retail space at the site in july  the partners announced the clothing store express as a squarefoot anchor tenant at the property in a deal that could bring in north of  million per year as trd has reported in a phone interview with trd sutton described holliday as “very intelligent” someone who “always keeps his word” and “very mature about other people making money” holliday said sl green’s retail ventures — comparatively few compared to its office holdings — are “a growing focus” of sutton holliday said “we have kind of a shared point of view in terms of how we value real estate and where we see the emerging market and we’re very nimble not only at structuring the transactions but at financing them when that works it works really well” in kushner’s view sl green was “smart to identify jeff’s genius they helped him do things that he could never have done and he helped them do things they could never have done” the only misstep for the partnership appears to be  broadway a times square retail property where sl green and sutton acquired a controlling leasehold interest in  sutton is no longer involved and sl green is now facing a ground lease eviction at the site after missing a series of payments holliday confirmed to trd that the property was in litigation but did not elaborate sutton declined to comment on the deal sl green has also dipped its toe in residential waters in october  sl green partnered with ofer yardeni’s stonehenge partners in a  million acquisition of eight manhattan retail and multifamily properties including  east th street a unit multifamily building sl green and stonehenge will also do a luxury renovation of a unit building at  amsterdam avenue where the partnership paid  million last summer for a year ground lease and in march sl green paid  million to acquire a newly constructed williamsburg condo and townhouse portfolio with developer ben shaoul during its firstquarter earnings call in april mathias said sl green is also considering converting  madison avenue the  millionsquare foot gramercy park office building to residential these new ventures sources said are made possible in part by holliday’s track record “the two things you want in a deal” ngkf’s kuhn said “are certainty of closing and a fair person on the other side who’s not trying to take the last nickel off the table marc gives you that” short url print popular vornado dresses up times square space with new sephora lease kabbalah centre buying fine arts building for m “million dollar listing ny” the buyer’s movin’ on
