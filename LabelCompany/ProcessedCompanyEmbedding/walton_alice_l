the untold story of alice waltons dwi incident min readpublished jan  by peter rughsharetweetemailit was a routine arrest the kind texas public safety officers like trooper jeffrey davis make every day but little did davis know that the woman he had just booked for driving while intoxicated possessed a superhuman power she wasnt able to walk heel to toe she couldnt put her index finger to her nose if her eyes were shut she even had a hard time keeping her head up in other words she failed the standardized roadside sobriety test that davis administered the evening of oct   and was arrestedyet she was alice walton heiress to the walmart fortune a woman with a superhuman power at her disposal the power to swipeup artistic masterpieces prized around the world and horde them in backwater bentonville ark the power to keep an international payroll of three million people doing your bidding under the boot of poverty its the power to fly to fly above the law the superhuman power of moneydavis might have known he hadnt pulled over just anyone when he informed her the registration on her suv was expired walton replied i have someone who does that for mewalton has a lot of people who do things for her doctors for instance though they couldnt explain away the droopy head she had two of them write notes to the court in parker county texas explaining that she hasnt been able to maintain her balance when she crashed a jeep into a mexican ravine on thanksgiving day the acapulco crash that left her left leg shorter than her right was to be the first of many for walton five years later while speeding in fayetteville ark she struck and killed oleta hardin a yearold cannery worker she never received so much as a ticketwalton managed to keep her fender clean for nearly a decade after the deadly collision but in  she got wasted and totaled an suv in springdale arkdo you know who i am she asked responding officers who charged her with a dwi do you know my last name it was a rhetorical questionwaltons lawyers tried to argue that fatigue from working too hard at the office that day not her bloodalcohol content six points above the legal limit caused her to plow into a gas meter and telephone booth the springdale judge didnt buy it and the charge stuck walton paid a  fine her net worth at the time was an estimated  billionsince then the walmart empire has grown considerably and with it alice waltons superhuman power today according to forbes shes worth  billion to escape her latest legal quagmire walton went with a disappearing actit will cease to exist for us in any way — literally assistant parker county prosecutor fred barker told the local dallasfort worth nbc affiliate last october referring to waltons dwi charge barkers office decided to let the statute of limitations to prosecute walton expire they had video evidence of her all sloppy fumbling through her gymnastics exam but trooper davis was unable to testify after he was mysteriously suspended last march and no bloodalcohol testing was ever conducted three weeks later a parker county judge granted a petition from waltons lawyers to remove records of the arrest from the countys file systemtheres really no way to stop it barker remarked “its gone gone gonewith her latest foible expunged walton appeared on the cover of forbes in a piece detailing her shot at redemption by redemption forbes means storing cezannes and picassos at a museum she built thats a three hour drive from the nearest population center and raising cutting horses which apparently shes had no trouble mounting despite her lack of balancebut while waltons dwi charge is gone gone gone trouble has begun to foment in the walmart empire the bigbox retailers employees are asking themselves why they are barely scraping by on near minimum wages while company executives and major stockholders like walton live lavishly in staging a series of strikes and protests at walmarts nationwide they have begun to

any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should beresolved in favor of arbitration  arbitration  nasd code  when court is required to compel arbitration  a court is required to compel arbitration under the arbitration procedures of the national association of securities dealers code if the underlying dispute either arises  in connection with the business of such members or in connection with the activities of such associated persons or  out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated persons with such a member  arbitration  nasd code  dispute over bonusplan proceeds did not arise out of appellees employment with subject company  where the parties admitted that the subject company was the only nasd member in the case where as an employee of an nasd member appellee signed an arbitration agreement embodied in the u form where the underlying dispute in the case was whether appellee was entitled to payment under the terms of the joint ventures capital markets bonus plan and not whether he was entitled to payment under any agreement with the subject company where the capital markets bonus plan did not indicate that appellee served on the capital markets committee as a representative of any of appellants companies where neither the joint venture nor any of its individual members were members of nasd and where the only thing that the subject company had in commonwith two of the three members of the joint venture was that all three entities were owned by appellant who was sued in her individual capacity and not as a director or officer of any of the relevant entities the supreme court concluded that this connection was much too tenuous to say that the underlying dispute over the proceeds of a bonus plan arose out of appellees employment with the subject company the sole nasd member in this case  arbitration  nasd code  dispute over bonusplan proceeds did not arise in connection with business of subject company  given the reasoning undergirding its conclusion that the dispute over bonusplan proceeds did not arise out of appellees employment with the subject company the supreme court agreed with the trial

this case  arbitration  unambiguous language of agreement did not require arbitration of appellees tort claims  trial courts denial of motion to compel arbitration affirmed  although there is a strong

and charles l stutte for appellee annabelle clinton imber justice this is an arbitration case the appellants contend that the trial court erred when it denied their motion to compel arbitration of a tort action mr lewis filed against them we affirm the trial courts ruling alice l walton owns and controls over fifteen different companies bearing the llama name the llama companies involved in this appeal are llama capital services llc llama capital llama mortgage services corp llama mortgage and llama company lp llama company the appellee david lewis was the senior managing director of the arbitrage department of llama company which is a member of the national association of securities dealersnasd pursuant to his employment with llama company mr lewis executed a uniform application for securities industry registration or transfer form in  this form which is commonly known in the securities industry as the u contained the following arbitration clause i agree to arbitrate any dispute claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm or a customer or any other person that is required to be arbitrated under the rules constitutions or bylaws of the organization indicated in item  the nasd bylaws including the code of arbitration procedures as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction in october of  llama capital and llama mortgage entered into a joint venture with boston capital corporation for the buying and selling of commercial mortgages the joint venture was called boston capital mortgage company hereinafter the joint venture at the urging of ms walton mr lewis agreed to serve as a member of the joint ventures capital markets committee as a member of this committee mr lewis contends that he was eligible for the capital markets bonus planwhich provides that as a financial incentive    to maximize the value of the mortgage loan portfolio committee members would be entitled to bonus awards from a bonus pool the bonus plan contains a formula to calculate the bonus pool which is based upon a percentage of the joint ventures portfolio net gain specifically mr lewis alleges that he was entitled to approximately  under this bonus plan finally mr lewis did not complete a u form or any other arbitration agreement in connection with his services to the joint venture as a member of the capital markets committee and he remained on the llama company payroll at all times relevant to this appeal mr lewis claims that without his permission or knowledge ms walton llama capital andor llama mortgage instructed the joint venture to make the bonus payments directly payable to the general partners of the joint venture instead of the individual members of the capital markets committee the joint venture allegedly complied with this request by paying the funds to the general partners instead of mr lewis ms walton then allegedly transferred the funds to llama company and notified mr lewis that he would not receive those funds accordingly on august   mr lewis filed a tort action against ms walton llama capital llama mortgage and llama company in his complaint mr lewis alleged that the defendants converted his property and intentionally interfered with his contractual relationship with the joint venture mr lewis concluded his complaint with a prayer for compensatory damages in an amount not less than  and for punitive damages against the separate defendant alicel walton in the sum of  the trial court subsequently granted mr lewiss request to voluntarily nonsuit his claim against llama company soon after mr lewis filed his complaint the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration in this pleading the defendants alleged that the u agreement the nasd bylaws and the federal arbitration act required the claim to be submitted to arbitration on january   the trial court denied the defendants motion to compel arbitration because the arbitration agreement did not encompass the subject matter or the parties involved in the underlying dispute ms walton llama capital and llama mortgage hereinafter appellants timely filed a notice of appeal of the january   order denying the motion to compel arbitration as we have previously explained the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is an immediately appealable order terminix intl co v stabbs  ark   swd   american ins co v cazort  ark   swd   i standard of review the first issue we must resolve in this case is what is the appropriate standard of review the parties concede and we agree that this case is governed by the federal arbitration act instead of the arkansas arbitration act because the underlying dispute involves interstate

healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration requires that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration morgan supra quoting moses h cone memorial hosp v mercury constr corp  us   ii nasd code of arbitration procedure  turning now to the merits we must decide whether the u agreement the arbitration clause contained therein and the nasd code of arbitration procedure required arbitration of mr lewiss tort claims against llama capital llama mortgage and ms walton as mentioned previously the u agreement mr lewis signed in connection with his employment with llama company provided in relevant part that i agree to arbitrate any dispute claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm or a customer or any other person that is required to be arbitrated under the rules constitutions or bylaws of the organization indicated in item  the nasd bylaws including the code of arbitration procedures as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction nasd code of arbitration procedures a entitled required submission provides that any dispute claim or controversy eligible for submission under the rule  series between or among members andor associated persons andor certain others arising in connection with the business of such members or in connection with the activities of such associated persons or arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated persons with such member shall be arbitrated under this code at the instance of  a member against another member  a member against a person associated with a member or a person associated with a member against a member and  a person associated with a member against a person associated with a member emphasis added pursuant to the unambiguous language of this provision we believe that a court is required to compel arbitration under the nasd code if the underlying dispute either arises  in connection with the business of such members or in connection with the activities of such associated persons or  out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated persons with such a member a arising out of employment of the member in their briefs the appellants assert that the first reason this dispute must be arbitrated is that the dispute arose out of the lewis employment with llama company this is the second subject matter listed above article iq of the nasd bylaws defines person associated with a member or associated person of a member as every sole proprietor partner officer director or branch manager of any member or any natural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions or any natural person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such member whether or not any such person is registered or exempt from registration with the corporation pursuant to these bylaws furthermore article i m and g of the nasd bylaws define member as any broker or dealer admitted to membership in the corporation nasd the parties agree that mr lewis is the associated person and that llama company is the member moreover there is nothing in the record that suggests that either llama capital llama mortgage ms walton or the joint venture are members of nasd although the appellants cite many cases in their brief that define what type of dispute arises out of employment we think that the salient issue in this case is whether the dispute over the proceeds of the bonus plan arose out of mr lewiss employment with llama company after a careful analysis of the relevant relationships in this case we must answer this question in the negative the parties admit that llama company is the only nasd member in this case as an employee of an nasd member mr lewis signed an arbitration agreement embodied in the u form the underlying dispute in this case is whether mr lewis is entitled to payment under the terms of the joint ventures capital markets bonus plan and not whether mr lewis is entitled to payment under any agreement with llama company importantly the capital markets bonus plan does not indicate that mr lewis served on the capital markets committee as a representative of any llama company we are also persuaded by the fact that neither the joint venture nor any of its individual members llama capital llama mortgage or boston capital corporationare members of nasd hence the appellants claim that the nasd arbitration agreement applies in this case because two of the members of the joint venture llama capital and llama mortgage were one of the fifteen or so business entities loosely associated with llama company the only nasd member in fact the only thing that llama company has in common with llama capital and llama mortgage is that all three entities are owned by alice walton who was sued in her individual capacity and not as a director or officer of any of the relevant llama entities we agree with the trial court that this connection is much too tenuous to say that the underlying dispute in this case arose out of mr lewiss employment with llama company the sole nasd member b arising in connection with the business of a member next the appellants turn to the first phrase of section a defining the subject matter of disputes that must be submitted to arbitration specifically they allege in this section of their briefs that the second reason the subject matter of this dispute must be arbitrated is that it arose out of the business of lewis employer llama company for the reasons explained above we agree with the trial court that the dispute over the bonusplan proceeds has to do with the business of the joint venture and not with the business of llama company the sole nasd member in thiscase iii conclusion because we do not think that mr lewiss tort claims against the appellants fall under the subject matter of the arbitration agreement we need not address the appellants remaining arguments as to whether they are the proper parties to compel arbitration under nasd code  or whether they may enforce the arbitration agreement as thirdparty beneficiaries in sum although there is a strong federal policy favoring arbitration when the language of the arbitration agreement is ambiguous we hold that the unambiguous language of the arbitration agreement in this case does not require arbitration of mr lewiss tort claims against the appellants accordingly we affirm the trial courts denial of the motion to compel arbitration affirmed corbin j thornton j and smith j dissent ray thornton justice dissenting i respectfully dissent from the majoritys conclusion that arbitration is not required in my view the agreement entered into by mr lewis and the llama company the u clearly subjects this case to arbitration the nasd code of arbitration procedure a applies to any dispute between or among members andor associated persons arising out of the employment of a person associated with such member the code further provides that such dispute shall be arbitrated under this code at the instance of a person associated with a member against a person associated with a member the llama company a member of the nasd was originally joined as a defendant in this case the llama company was the employer of mr lewis and was the only party to the litigation who was providing employment compensation to mr lewis for providing services to or at the direction of the llama company throughout the time of this dispute mr lewis as an employee of the llama company was an associated person with the nasd member the llama company and executed an agreement with his employer the u agreement to arbitrate any dispute between himself and his firm or any other person as described in a the u agreement is an agreement to arbitrate alice walton the president of the llama company was also a person associated with a member the llama company and had also executed a u agreement to arbitrate any disputes arising between ms walton and the llama company or a person associated with the llama company this dispute relates to the employment of mr lewis and the appropriate compensation for services provided by him at the direction of his employer for the benefit of a joint venture which was closely associated with his employer the llamacompany the majority holds that the dispute does not arise out of mr lewiss employment with a member this conclusion is not supported by the pleadings stipulations of fact or affidavits presented in this case mr lewis was at all times relevant to this suit an employee of the llama company the llama company is an nasd member the llama company and all of its sister companies are controlled by alice walton alice walton urged mr lewis to perform services for the joint venture while providing services to this joint venture mr lewis continued to work for alice waltons llama company all work on the joint venture performed by mr lewis was completed from his fayetteville llama company office moreover the claim asserted by mr lewis was that alice walton and two other defendants llama capital andor llama mortgage converted the money in dispute by depositing it with the llama company the nasd member and mr lewiss employer the heart of this dispute involves activities that took place during mr lewiss tenure at the llama company specifically it involves events that were the direct result of a work assignment given to mr lewis by alice walton accordingly all conditions set forth in the unambiguous agreement to arbitrate signed by mr lewis with alice waltons llama company should be enforced alice walton as a person associated with the nasd member has the right to demand arbitration mr lewis sought to avoid this result by dismissing the llama company from the litigationon the day before the hearing but that does not bar alice waltons rights see american ins co v cazort  ark   swd   holding that one should not be allowed to circumvent arbitration by nonsuiting a party that would subject the matter to arbitration in my view llama capital and llama mortgage have a status interwoven with that of alice walton and arbitration addressing the merits of the compensation issue will resolve any remaining issues between mr lewis and these two corporations if not joined in arbitration of the underlying dispute any separate action against them should be stayed pending resolution of the arbitration dispute the disposition of this case by submitting it to arbitration is required by the plain and unambiguous language of the u agreements and the code of arbitration procedure it must also be noted that the position taken by the majority opinion today is contrary to the overwhelming public policy favoring arbitration the united states supreme court in dean witter reynolds inc v byrd  us   articulated its position on the use of arbitration in cases such as the present case subject to the federal arbitration act the court held that the arbitration act provides that written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising out of an existing contract shall be valid irrevocable and enforceable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity forthe revocation of any contract  usc §  by its terms the act leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed §§   id the court also noted that the arbitration act establishes that as a matter of federal law any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration dean witter reynolds inc v byrd  us   see also moses h cone memorial hospital v mercury construction corp  us   morgan v smith barney harris upham  co  fd  th cir  the language used by the court seems clear that in a case that is governed by the federal arbitration act there is strong public policy in favor of arbitration arkansas has followed the federal courts lead and also expressed a preference for resolving matters through arbitration in anthony v kaplan  ark   swd   we explained the advantages to arbitration noting that as a matter of public policy arbitration is strongly favored and is looked upon with approval by courts as a less expensive and more expeditious means of settling litigation and relieving docket congestion lancaster v west  ark   swd   estate of sandefur v greenway  swd  mo app wd  anthony v kaplan  ark   swd  we have also followed the federal courts view that any doubts and ambiguities of what matters are subject to arbitration should be resolved in favor of arbitration see wessell bros v crossett sch dist no   ark   swd   thus i am dismayed that the majority has failed to acknowledge that the u signed by mr lewis clearly subjects him to arbitration at the demand of ms walton who has also signed a u agreement i am also concerned that the majority has ignored the strong public policy favoring arbitration as consistently announced by this court and federal courts for those reasons i respectfully must dissent i am authorized to state that corbin and smith jj join in this dissent  the bonus plan defines net gain as realized gain after payment of all expenses  including payment to llama company of a fair market investment banking fee in the case ofsecuritization  mr lewis did not name boston capital corporation or the joint venture boston capital mortgage company as defendants  on page  of their brief the appellants argue that the trial court should have compelled arbitration under section  because all claims asserted by lewis arise from the business of llama company or his employment with llama company and his relationship with person and entities associated with llama company emphasis added this argument however ignores the plain language of section  which requires the underlying employment dispute to be between the associated person and a member and not between an associated person and person and entities associated with the member  it should be noted that in their briefs the appellants do not rely upon the remaining portion of this phrase which is in connection with activities of such associated persons  any dispute claim or controversy eligible for submission under the rule  series between or among members and or associated persons and or certain others arising in connection with the business of such members or in connection with the activities of such associated persons or arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated persons with such member shall be arbitrated under this code at the instance of  a member against another member  a member against a person associated with a member or aperson associated with a member against a member and  a person associated with a member against a person associated with a member  i agree to arbitrate any dispute claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm or a customer or any other person that is required to be arbitrated under the rules constitutions or bylaws of the organization indicated in item  the nasd bylaws
