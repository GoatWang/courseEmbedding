discovered to do more sustainable good we needed to dispose of some old fixtures and packaging and typically they would have been sent to a landfill this didn’t seem right so i started asking questions i knew there had to be a better solution and became determined to find a new home for these items after reaching out to several organizations we found a place that would put all of it to use in a helpful way in this gallery dwell with dignity domestic and corporate locations outfitted with wire baskets chairs and other fixtures donated by fossil group how did fossil group support you in improving your business practices fossil group pointed me in the right direction for a solution providing contact information for people and companies that may be able to help they believed in what i

water bottles as they could with a team captain leading the way in each district they got strategic and got going finding unique ways to make maximum impact stores put up posters sent emails involved

create useful everyday products we partnered with them to create an ecofriendly tote in our favorite seasonal prints—offering customers a product they can be proud of for even more than its great design having that product as motivation the stores felt the impact of every bottle what happenedfrom chicago through texas and florida all  stores in our central region participated and it paid off in just a few short months around  bottles were collected for perspective that would be enough to create close to  repreve® bags one store alone—our watch station outlet at orlando premium—collected

recently big thought and all stars project i’ve been involved as a speaker for the cultural city in the dallas city of ideas festival and collaborated on a show with two amazing nonprofits first is make art with purpose an organization and virtual resource center for creative projects that are shaping and transforming our world in positive ways second is human rights initiative a nonprofit that offers  percent free legal service to immigrants in the dfw area seeking political asylum or shelter from abuse my mother and i were featured in the december holiday issue of southern living as tastemakers by the editoratlarge jenna bush hager all of these experiences have been wonderful and beyond my hopes and imagination if i’m able to positively affect one person in hisher perspective on artlife then i know i’ve been successful — what are some of your tipstechniques my mom always told me “if you do what you love the rest will come” it’s been excellent advice not only in my creative endeavors but in my corporate practice as well i tell the kids this all the time the act of making art has to come from the heart and flow freely — how do you balance your creative class persona and your main career i don’t really have to balance them they are one and the same it’s important for an artist to find aspirations in life and it’s our job to help humanity see the beauty in every detail whether that’s helping a child whose school cannot afford art programs working with them so they can earn their college scholarship fund or assisting my fellow team member to find the best materials that can best execute their designs in the most cost efficient manner—it’s all about giving your best — what is your dream of where this could lead my dream is to be able to practice social awareness art on a broader level in our own backyard to help reach more people than i’m able to now i am a mom to a bright yearold boy named lang i would love for him to grow up knowing we can change the world for the better by practicing kindness every day one act at a time view jinya’s work on instagram jinyahuang sous les étoiles gallery art  seek against the grain human rights initiative the dallas

class meet bridgette we are proud of our strong company culture rooted in collaboration and innovation this special series highlights the creativity of our employees on and off the clock bridgette burke product coordinator patternmaker and graderbridgette brings big ideas to life both in her work at fossil and as a budding entrepreneur we asked bridgette more about her creative class persona and here’s what she had to say what is your creative class hobby or business my creative class business is called the crazy grader a small businesstobusiness operation dedicated to helping upstart fashion houses manufacturing companies and private individuals meet their patternmaking and grading goals the crazy grader was derived from a mind that is equal parts creative and technical i guess i get that from my parents my dad is a drummer and my mom a hairstylist both of which require creative and technical expertise in their fields — what do you do at fossil and what makes your job unique i work on the ladies jewelry product development team along with my amazing teammates crystal and phaedra i manage the seasonal production lifecycle for the ladies jewelry business i have the opportunity to see the designs created by our talented designers and then my team has those designs sampled and produced through our factories all the while negotiating to make the best product at the best cost we see the styles through the entire production lifecycle from concept to market pretty exciting click to view larger   how does your creative class skill set align with what you do for your day job attention to detail is of high importance in both roles in patternmaking and grading attention to detail is required to deliver patterns that are perfectly balanced and trued which will create a quality fit in the jewelry making business the same level of attention to detail is required throughout the production lifecycle in order to deliver a quality product to fossil’s stores and its wholesalers — how did you get started and what was your original inspiration while finishing up college for fashion design my classmates would often see me grading my professor’s original first patterns to various sizes and would ask if i could also grade their patterns fashion designers love the design aspect but most do not enjoy the pattern making and grading piece of it all of that technical stuff is “just not sexy” to them so that’s where i come in prior to graduation i entered a little black dress designer competition and grabbed second place out of over  student designers this large cash award along with another cash award earned from the fashionista’s fashion fund went straight into a business account and grew from there i set up the business purchased the computer software sewing and printing equipment and supplies needed to upstart my business and got to it growing up my dream has always been to design clothing i would draw clothing for my paper dolls and figure out the perfect fit on the girlswhat are some successes you’ve had with your creative class business one of my most recent successes occurred just this past holiday season when i developed an outsourcing partnership with a local manufacturing company to grade their client’s patterns on an ongoing basis i had previously introduced my business to this company over a year ago they recently lost their pattern grader and remembered me — q what is your dream of where this could lead i am definitely a dreamer growing up my dream has always been to design clothing i would draw clothing for my paper dolls and figure out the perfect fit on the girls i remember making an outfit at yearsold and my sassy auntie put on her heels and statement jewelry and wore it out dancing and looked amazing in it though i am not necessarily living the designer’s life that i dreamed of as a young girl i have found my niche in the business of fashion and plan to grow from there what’s next pretapatternscom

looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time
