wishlist not a spec they oscillate between the dweeby features the business rules and the overall goalscommentary careful your crm integration consultant may not know anythingeverything needs to be translated into pure system attributes and features its pretty rare for internal staff to really succeed with writing the specs on their own instead bring in a consultant who will be excluded from the bidding to help you set crm project priorities and write an ironclad spec of what youll need—and only what you really needstep  when shortlisting pit crm vendors against each otheras vendors respond to your rfi rfp or rfq look for more than just good answers does the crm vendor proposal include rules of engagement for the project if theres no guidance and dialog during the bidding process about the how the project will be managed then friction is likely to develop later on there are just too many places for mismatched assumptionsat some point youll eliminate some vendors identify which of the disqualified ones you communicate best with and then engage them in a short but critical task make it clear that they arent in the running pay them for their time and ask them to do two final tasksapply value engineering to the other vendors proposed approaches by ruthlessly applying the  rule there is always a way to satisfy the core business requirement with a smaller level of effort sharpshoot the contract looking for areas where you could get severely hit by ecos and loopholesduring your shortlisting cycle modify your specs and contract to avoid the problems that the outoftherunning vendor has spotted even if you pay the vendor  an hour for this task youll still save a bundle overallstep  pay attention during the crm implementationif the winning vendor is smart it will precisely specify what it will and wont deliver in the statement of work sow any change to the sow will probably require an eco—each with its own price tag this will be true even if the following happensyou didnt understand the consequences of the specified deliverable for example the sow might say  triggers and  workflows but you may have no idea whether that functionality will be satisfactory to your users you discover bad assumptions additional requirements or plot complications—or you simply change your mind—at any time after the contract is signed all the itemized deliverables do not solve your system problem make your users happy or achieve your business objectivealso note that the sow may contain a line item for an explicit number of hours of project meetings as well as another item for project management if meetings or your decisionsapprovals take longer than the allotted time the vendor is within its right to issue a change order commentary why crm implementation is so political more  ways to send a custom software project off the railsduring serious fixedprice projects meetings and the sequence of tasks will not be under your control at times it may feel like youre working for the vendor youll receive action items decision deadlines and resource requests in particular youll need to complete your testing before features can be fully deployed the vendor has to be running the show if its going to deliver on time and on budget with qualityin other words be prepared for the vendor to say no fairly often if this all sounds a bit adversarial it is the vendors fixed price commitment is to delivering only the items you put in the spec not to making you happythis wont happen though if you prepare your team to the real requirements of fixedprice engagements it may not be easy but the shortterm pain will result in longterm gains that make users and executives happydavid taber is the author of the new prentice hall
