distributor of the trust and several fund mergers that if approved by fund shareholders should improve the scale and marketability of the trust the trust comprises  funds and  billion in assets at june   that are investment options in phoenixs variable life and annuity products  virtus currently serves as administrator to the trust and subadvisor to  million of fund assets and will assume subadvisory responsibilities for an additional  million of fund assets  goodwin capital advisers an affiliate of phoenix and aberdeen asset management will continue to manage  million of assets under subadvisory agreements with virtus four of the funds with approximately  million of assets will not be part of the transaction and will be merged into a thirdparty variable insurance trust at a later

gives us a new product line that we can offer to other insurance companies as we expand our distribution reach into the variable insurance trust marketplace aylward said  we look forward to building on our relationship with phoenix customers and offering our investment management and administration expertise to other insurance companies financial terms of the agreement which is expected to close

accounting policies consistently followed by the phoenix series fund in the preparation of the schedules of investments the preparation of the schedules of investments in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the schedules of investments actual results could differ from those estimates a security valuation equity securities are valued at the official closing price typically last sale on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded or if no closing price is available at the last bid price debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations provided by a pricing service which in determining value utilizes information with respect to recent sales market transactions in comparable securities quotations from dealers and various relationships between securities in determining value as required some securities and assets may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the trustees certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available market prices for example significant events such as movement in the us securities market or other regional and local developments may occur between the time that foreign markets close where the security is principally traded and the time that the fund calculates its net asset value generally the close of the nyse that may impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets in these cases information from an external vendor may be utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to reflect their fair value because the frequency of significant events is not predictable fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a frequent basis shortterm investments having a remaining maturity of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market the money market fund uses the amortized cost method of security valuation absent extraordinary or unusual market conditions in the opinion of the trustees this represents the fair value of the securities the trustees monitor the deviations between the funds net asset value per share as determined by using available market quotations and its net asset value per share using amortized cost if the deviation exceeds  of  the board of trustees will consider what action if any should be initiated to provide fair valuation using this method the fund attempts to maintain a constant net asset value of  per share b security transactions and related income security transactions are recorded on the trade date dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date or in the case of certain foreign securities as soon as the fund is notified interest income is recorded on the accrual basis each fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective interest method realized gains and
