mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

made a number of strategic decisions including exiting a lowmargin business and accelerating into  a number of investments in our manufacturing network that are consistent with our longterm strategic plan and that best position us for the future while these discrete decisions impacted the quarter and the year they are largely completed and mostly covered by the strong fundamentals and the benefits

including the  million of discrete costs declined  to  million compared to  million in the yearago period outlook for the balance of the year forecasted adjusted diluted eps metrics provided below are nongaap measures the company does not provide guidance for the most directly comparable gaap measure diluted eps and we similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between our forecasted adjusted diluted eps and diluted eps metrics without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items such as noncash gains or losses resulting from marktomarket adjustments of hedging activities and foreign currency impacts these items are not within our control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results the company maintained its guidance for adjusted diluted eps for  in a range of  to  and now expects to be at the low end of the range reflecting the inclusion of the fullyear impact of the discrete items this outlook represents growth versus yearago approaching  and includes the following assumptions the benefit of the  week is expected to add approximately  to net sales and  to adjusted diluted eps for the year this impact will benefit the fourth quarter of  input cost inflation for the year continues to be estimated in the range of  to  productivity for the year is now estimated to be at the top or slightly ahead of the companys  to  of cost of products sold range excluding boulder brands acquisition synergies of at least  million that will benefit both gross margin and sga overhead adjusted net interest expense is now forecasted to be slightly below  million adjusted etr for the year including the benefit of the new accounting standard for stockbased compensation is now estimated in the range of  to  with the second half etr significantly higher than the first half the strategic investments that impacted the second quarter are also expected to impact the balance of the year primarily the third quarter by  the weighted average diluted share count for the year continues to be estimated at approximately  million shares with the second half higher than the first half capital expenditures for the year remain estimated in the range of  million to  million nongaap financial measures pinnacle uses the following nongaap financial measures as defined by the sec in its financial communications these nongaap financial measures should be considered as supplements to the gaap reported measures should not be considered replacements for or superior to the gaap measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies adjusted gross profit adjusted gross profit as a  of sales adjusted gross profit margin adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit adjusted net interest expense adjusted net earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted effective income tax rate adjusted etr adjusted gross profit pinnacle defines adjusted gross profit as gross profit before accelerated depreciation related to restructuring activities certain noncash items acquisition merger and other restructuring charges and other adjustments the company believes that the presentation of adjusted gross profit is useful to investors in the evaluation of the operating performance of companies in similar industries the company believes this measure is useful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends in addition adjusted gross profit is one of the components used to evaluate the performance of companys management such targets include but are not limited to measurement of sales efficiency productivity measures and recognition of acquisition synergies adjusted ebitda pinnacle defines adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda further adjusted to exclude certain noncash items nonrecurring items and certain other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance ebitda under the senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes adjusted ebitda does not include adjustments for equitybased compensation and certain other adjustments related to acquisitions both of which are permitted in calculating covenant compliance ebitda management uses adjusted ebitda as a key metric in the evaluation of underlying company performance in making financial operating and planning decisions and in part in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers and employees the company believes this measure is useful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends additionally pinnacle believes the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides investors with useful information as it is an important component in measuring covenant compliance in accordance with the financial covenants and determining our ability to service debt and meet any payment obligations in addition pinnacle believes that adjusted ebitda is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies many of which present an adjusted ebitda measure when reporting their results the company has historically reported adjusted ebitda to analysts and investors and believes that its continued inclusion provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past present and future operating results adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net earnings loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the companys operating performance as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent net earnings or loss or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs in particular the definitions of adjusted ebitda in the senior secured credit facility and the indentures allow pinnacle to add back certain noncash extraordinary unusual or nonrecurring charges that are deducted in calculating net earnings or loss however these are expenses that may recur vary greatly and are difficult to predict while ebitda and adjusted ebitda and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit adjusted earnings before interest and taxes is provided because pinnacle believes it is useful information in understanding our ebit results by improving the comparability of yeartoyear results additionally adjusted ebit provides transparent and useful information to management investors analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing the company and its segments primary operating results from period to period after removing the impact of unusual nonoperational or restructuringrelated activities that affect comparability adjusted ebit is one of the measures management uses for planning and budgeting monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends adjusted net interest expense adjusted net interest expense is provided to assist the reader by eliminating charges which result from refinancing activities or unusual transactions management believes that the adjusted net interest expense measure is useful information to investors in order to demonstrate a measure of interest expense that is associated with the ordinary course of business operations and that it is more comparable to interest expense in prior periods pinnacle uses adjusted net interest expense to conduct and evaluate its business in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the corporations financing strategies and to analyze trends in interest expense absent the effect of unusual transactions adjusted net earnings adjusted effective income tax rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted net earnings adjusted effective income tax rate and the related adjusted diluted earnings per share metrics are provided to present the reader with the aftertax impact of adjusted ebit and adjusted interest expense net in order to improve the comparability and understanding of the related gaap measures adjusted net earnings adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide transparent and useful information to management investors analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results from period to period after removing the impact of unusual nonoperational or restructuringrelated activities that affect comparability adjusted net earnings adjusted effective income tax rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share are measures used by management for planning and budgeting monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results conference call information the company will host a conference call on
