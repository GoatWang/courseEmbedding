looking statements in this annual report references to worldnet we us and our refer to worldnet inc of nevada this annual report contains certain forwardlooking statements for this purpose any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements without limiting the foregoing words such as may will expect believe anticipate estimate or continue or comparable terminology are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors many of which are not within worldnets control these factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the industries in which worldnet may participate competition within worldnets chosen industry including competition from much larger competitors technological advances and failure by worldnet to successfully develop business relationships item  description of business business development we were incorporated in the state of nevada on march   as the whollyowned subsidiary of vip worldnet inc and shortly after our incorporation we entered into an agreement to lease sell and market the hystar airship and the burket mill a waste milling device however the venture was found to be cost prohibitive and we ceased such activities in  and did not engage in any further commercial operations our plan we are a blank check company and have had recurring operating losses for the past two fiscal years our independent auditors have expressed doubt that we can continue as a going concern unless we obtain financing to continue operations our business plan is to seek investigate and if warranted acquire an interest in a business opportunity our acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by merger exchange of stock or otherwise we have very limited sources of capital and we probably will only be able to take advantage of one business opportunity at the present time we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue nor have we reached any preliminary or definitive agreements or understandings with any person concerning an acquisition or merger based on current economic and regulatory conditions management believes that it is possible if not probable for a company like ours without many assets or liabilities to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable private company the opportunity arises principally because of the high legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration process of going public however should any of these conditions change it is very possible that there would be little or no economic value for anyone taking over control of worldnet our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry including both us and international companies our management has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity subject to the availability of such opportunities economic conditions and other factors our management believes that companies who desire a public market to enhance liquidity for current stockholders or plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash will be potential merger or acquisition candidates the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and extremely risky and will be pksbrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd made by management in the exercise of its business judgement there is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our stockholders should a merger or acquisition prove unsuccessful it is possible management may decide not to pursue further acquisition activities and management may abandon its activities and we may become dormant or be dissolved our activities are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will in all probability act without consent vote or approval of our stockholders it is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by us could be limited by impact of the sec regulations regarding purchase and sale of penny stock our common stock is not publicly traded at this time and we cannot assure that a market will develop or that a stockholder ever will be able to liquidate his investments without considerable delay if at all if a market develops our shares will likely be subject to the rules of the penny stock suitability reform act of  the liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure procedures required by this act to be followed by all brokerdealers including but not limited to determining the suitability of the stock for a particular customer and obtaining a written agreement from the customer to purchase the stock this rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in any market investigation and selection of business opportunities we anticipate that business opportunities will come to our attention from various sources including our officers and directors our stockholders professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants securities brokerdealers investment banking firms venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals management expects that prior personal and business relationships and specifically our relationship with mutual ventures corporation an investment banking firm may lead to contacts with these various sources our management will analyze the business opportunities however none of our management are professional business analysts see part ii item  directors and executive officers our management has had limited experience with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been involved with an initial public offering management may rely on promoters or their affiliates principal stockholders or associates to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities our management may also hire an outside consultant since our management has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors we have not established the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors the service to be provided the term of service or the total amount of fees that may be paid however because of our limited resources it is likely that any such fee we agree to pay would be paid in stock and not in cash in addition there is a possibility that the amount of consultant fees may become a factor in negotiations related to a business opportunity certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between us and our officers and directors our management has other business interests to which they currently devote attention which include their primary employment and management of other blank check reporting companies they may be expected to continue to devote their attention to these other business interests although management time should be devoted to our business as a result conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through their exercise of judgement in a manner which is consistent with their fiduciary duties to us in particular don mayer our president is a director of other blank check companies with a structure and a business plan which is identical to ours and our management may in the future be involved with other blank check companies in the process of negotiations for an acquisition or merger or determination of consulting fees related to investigation of a business opportunity our principal stockholders and pksbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th management may consider their own personal pecuniary benefit or the interests of other blank check companies they are affiliated with rather than the best interests of our other stockholders we presently do not foresee entering into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which our officers or directors are currently affiliated we may acquire or merge with companies of which our managements affiliates or associates have a direct or indirect ownership interest if we determine in the future that a transaction with an affiliate would be in our best interest we are permitted by nevada law to enter into such a transaction if  the material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors the board authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum or  the material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the contract or transaction is specifically approved by vote of the stockholders or  the contract or transaction is fair to us at the time it is authorized approved or ratified by the board of directors or the stockholders a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon our managements analysis of the quality of the business opportunitys management and personnel the anticipated acceptability of its new products or marketing concept the merit of its technological changes the perceived benefit that it will derive from becoming a publicly held entity and numerous other factors which are difficult if not impossible to analyze through the application of any objective criteria in many instances we anticipate that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of the possible need to shift marketing approaches substantially expand significantly change product emphasis change or substantially augment management or make other changes we will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement or be primarily responsible for the implementation of required changes in our analysis of a business opportunity we anticipate that we will consider among other things the following factors  potential for growth and profitability indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products  our perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by our stockholders  whether following the business combination the financial condition of the business opportunity would be or would have a significant prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming sufficient to enable our securities to qualify for listing on a exchange or on a national automated securities quotation system such as nasdaq  capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by us or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources  the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced pksbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole  strength and diversity of existing management or management prospect that are scheduled for recruitment  the cost of our participation as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potential and  the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items no one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development thus the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities will be extremely difficult and complex potential investors must recognize that because of our limited capital available for investigation and managements limited experience in business analysis we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired form of acquisition we cannot predict the manner in which we may participate in a business opportunity specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as our needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected based upon our review and our relative negotiating strength such method may include but is not limited to leases purchase and sale agreements licenses joint ventures and other contractual arrangements we may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership corporation or other forms of organization we may be required to merge consolidate or reorganize with other corporations or forms of business organization in addition our present management and stockholders most likely will not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction our existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by our stockholders we likely will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that issuance of additional shares might also may be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest by current principal stockholders competition we expect to encounter substantial competition in our effort to locate attractive opportunities business development companies venture capital partnerships and corporations venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies small investment companies and wealthy individuals will be our primary competition many of these entities will have significantly greater experience resources and managerial capabilities than we do and will be in a better position than we are to obtain access to attractive business opportunities we also will experience competition from other public blank check companies many of which may have more funds available employees we currently have no employees our management expects to confer with consultants attorneys and accountants as necessary we do not anticipate a need to engage any fulltime employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities we will determine the need for employees based upon the specific business pksbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th opportunity item  description of properties we do not currently own or lease any property we utilize office space in the office of one of our shareholders at no cost until we pursue a viable business opportunity and recognize income we will not seek independent office space item  legal proceedings we are not a party to any proceedings or threatened proceedings as of the date of this filing item  submission of matters to a vote of security holders we have not submitted a matter to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the  fiscal year item  market price for common equity and related stockholder matters we have had no market activity in our stock as of this filing we have approximately  stockholders of record holding  common shares  shares are unrestricted and  shares are restricted shares as that term is defined in rule  we have no options or warrants outstanding we have not declared dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future b recent sales of unregistered securities we have not sold any shares within the past three years without registration item  managements discussion and analysis or plan of operation plan of operation we have no assets and have experienced losses from inception as of the year ended december   we had no cash on hand and total current liabilities of  the current liabilities reflect a note payable to mutual ventures corporation for accounting and legal fees incurred in  and paid on our behalf by mutual ventures we have no commitments for capital expenditures for the next twelve months during the next twelve months we believe that our current cash needs can be met by loans from our directors officers and stockholders based on understandings we have with these individuals we anticipate that mutual ventures corporation will continue to provide investment banking services and advance costs on our behalf we may repay these loans costs of services and advancements with cash if available or we may convert them into common stock also management anticipates future private placements of our common shares will help fund our operations our reporting obligations involve considerable time energy and professional fees we will incur expenses due to the legal and accounting services required to prepare such reports and the costs of filing such reports with the pksbth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities and exchange commission also our management must expend time and effort to assist in the preparation and review of such reports in the event we acquire a business opportunity we may incur additional expenses related to proxy or information statements we must provide to our stockholders which disclose that companys business operations management and financial condition in addition the acquired or merged company will be subject to these same reporting obligations our management intends to actively seek business opportunities during the next twelve months and if we obtain a business opportunity it may be necessary to raise additional capital this may be accomplished by selling our common stock item  financial statements reference is made to the financial statements for the years ended december   and  which are attached to this form ksb report item
