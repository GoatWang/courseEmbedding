made and lost several fortunes  tax avoidance in her book dark money jane mayer writes that anschutz a major funder of the rightwing movement had attempted to avoid paying capital gains taxes in a  transaction by using what are called prepaid variable forward contracts these contracts allow wealthy shareholders such as anschutz whose fortune forbes estimated at  billion as of  to promise to give

raised  million in  by promising shares in his oil and natural gas companies through the firm donaldson lufkin  jenrette republican donations conservative causes anschutz is an active republican donor annys shin wrote november   in the washington post since  he his companies and members of his family have given more than  in campaign contributions to gop candidates and committees in  anschutzs family foundation gave focus on the family founder james dobson an award for his contributions to the american family rightwing content embedded in film anschutz has entered hollywood financing almost a dozen projects with his anschutz film group the recently dismantled crusader entertainment and the more recent walden media  anshutz has been criticized for embedding rightwing ideological content in his movies anshutzs  film waiting for superman attacked the public school system cheering on private charters as an alternative author and academic rick ayers lambasted the accuracy of the film describing it as a slick marketing piece full of halftruths and distortions in ayers view the corporate powerhouses and the ideological opponents of all things public have employed the film to break the teachers unions and to privatize education while driving teachers wages even lower and running schools like little corporations ayers also critiqued the films promotion of a greater focus on topdown instruction driven by test scores positing that extensive research has demonstrated that standardized testing dumbs down the curriculum and reproduces inequities while marginalizing english language learners and those who do not grow up speaking a middle class vernacular lastly ayers says that schools are more segregated today than before brown v board of education in  and thus criticized the film for not mentioning that black and brown students are being suspended expelled searched and criminalized diane ravitch research professor of education at new york university and a nonresident senior fellow at the brookings institution similarly criticizes the films lack of accuracy the most substantial distortion in the film according to ravitch is the films claim that  percent of eighthgrade students cannot read at grade level a misrepresentation of data from the national assessment of educational progress ravitch served as a board member with the naep and says that the naep doesnt measure performance in terms of gradelevel achievement as claimed in the film but only as advanced proficient and basic the film assumes that any student below proficient is below grade level but this claim is not supported by the naep data ravitch says that a study by stanford university economist margaret raymond of  charter schools found that only  are superior in math test performance to a matched public school and many perform badly casting doubt on the films claim that privately managed charter schools are the solution to bad public schools the film says however that it is focusing on the one in five superior charter schools or close to  that do outperform public schools one of the reasons for the high test scores writes ravitch is that many charter schools expel lowperforming students to bring up their average scores ravitch also writes that many charter schools are involved in unsavory real estate deals  anschutz’s  film wont back down portrays socalled parent trigger laws as an effective mechanism for transforming underperforming public schools “but the films distortion of the facts prompts a closer examination of its funders and backers and a closer look at those promoting parent trigger as a cure for what ails the american education system while parent trigger was first promoted by a small charter school operator in california it was taken up and launched into hyperdrive by two controversial rightwing organizations the american legislative exchange council alec and the heartland institute” reports the center for media and democracy publisher of sourcewatchorg  other projects include movies based on classroom books and a partnership with disney to turn cs lewis narnia series into a string of movies he spent millions

limitedliability company with two of mr anschutz’s top lieutenants together they own a acre property on the colorado river in the mountains northwest of denver where they built a vacation home togetherjudge gorsuch began representing mr anschutz and his companies when he was working for the washington law firm then known as kellogg huber mark hansen a senior partner at the firm said he assigned the future judge then a junior partner to help on various cases involving the anschutz company “both because of his skills and experience and because he had expressed to me an interest in getting involved in things relating to his home state”a  case was typical a teachers’ retirement fund that owned shares in the regal entertainment theater chain sued over its decision to issue a debtfinanced dividend that would permit mr anschutz who owned  percent of the company to extract  million the plaintiffs said this amounted to selfdealingjudge gorsuch helped win a ruling in regal’s favor by arguing that it could handle the extra debt telling a judge “this company is what some analysts call a cash cow”another set of shareholder lawsuits in which mr gorsuch represented mr anschutz involved qwest communications international whose stock price had collapsed amid an accounting fraud scandal after mr anschutz a qwest board member had sold off a large stake mr hansen said a judge

afterward a seat on the federal appeals court in denver became vacant and mr anschutz sought to secure it for him photo the billionaire philip f anschutz helps fund the heritage foundation and the federalist society which developed the list of potential nominees from which president trump selected judge gorsuch credit david zalubowskiassociated press in january  a top lawyer for mr anschutz sent a letter on the billionaire’s behalf to president george w bush’s white house counsel harriet e miers suggesting that he nominate judge gorsuch the letter said mr anschutz had spoken to colorado’s only republican senator at the time wayne allard about his idea“i have had the pleasure of knowing mr gorsuch for several years as we worked closely together on several complex federal cases” wrote the lawyer bruce black who is now the executive vice president and general counsel of the anschutz company “i have found mr gorsuch to be an exceptionally talented lawyer”when he was named to the appeals court judge gorsuch sought to recuse himself from numerous anschutzrelated cases “because my former client” was involved according to a list he submitted to the senatein  he did participate in a case involving a firm that had merged with qwest the disability fund of the old firm not qwest was named as the defendant although the opinion written by another judge noted the old firm was “now qwest”liz johnson a spokeswoman for judge gorsuch portrayed his participation in that anschutzlinked case as inadvertent explaining that he did not include the old firm’s name in a recusal list he filed with the court clerk because “it did not exist as an independent company” when he became a judgesteven lubet a northwestern university law professor who has written about judicial ethics and recusals said that so long as judge gorsuch disqualifies himself on a casebycase basis from supreme court cases that are too involved with mr anschutz’s interests his ties to the

anytime ms johnson said his recusal practices at the appeals court went further than what is required on the supreme court the supreme court’s procedure is that individual justices decide for themselves whether any particular case meets a vague standard for recusal set by a  statute it does not address whether cases involving former clients raise an improper appearance of a conflict of interest advertisement continue reading the main story james sample a hofstra university law professor who has studied supreme court recusals said “it’s very reasonable to ask a supreme court nominee for a more thorough answer” about how he will weigh such decisions especially since “it seems as though there is a kind of continuous relationship — this is not just a past client”one of the anschutz executives judge gorsuch represented in a qwest lawsuit was cannon harvey the head of the venture capital investment arm of mr anschutz’s empire in  a company called the walden group filed paperwork with the colorado secretary of state that listed mr harvey as the company’s registered agent but did not disclose any other partners’ identitiesbut when he was nominated for the appeals court judge gorsuch disclosed in his senate questionnaire that he was a partner too the walden group attracted little attention until his nomination to the supreme court when american bridge a liberal research group identified public records about it that linked judge gorsuch to mr harveydays after its formation the walden group purchased a acre property along the colorado river’s headwaters in the mountains northwest of denver the group then built a squarefoot log house there overlooking “the quiet seclusion of the private fishery” including both sides of  feet of the river according to a real estate listingms johnson said the walden group has three partners judge gorsuch mr harvey and kevin conwick the judge befriended mr harvey while representing anschutz companies and mr conwick was a friend of the judge’s late father a denver lawyer she saidmr conwick is also another important member of mr anschutz’s network his law firm profile focuses on his work through the years as the billionaire’s counsel in deals to buy sports teams and develop stadium and entertainment district projects like the staples center in los angeles photo the walden group including judge gorsuch purchased a acre property along the colorado river’s headwaters in the mountains northwest of denver credit julie turkewitzthe new york times ms johnson said judge gorsuch contributed  to the walden group giving him a  percent stake mr harvey and mr conwick each own  percent she said the partners divide the time when each has a right to vacation on the river property as well as taxes and utilities based on their respective shares advertisement continue reading the main story although the judge’s stake is smaller than his partners’ county records direct correspondence about the property to him at the federal courthouse in denvera longtime friend of judge gorsuch’s whom ms johnson made available to discuss the property said the partnership had its origin years ago when judge gorsuch’s father and a dozen friends — including mr conwick — bought an adjoining property to be a timeshare they called the walden hollow fishing club when the acre property became available the judge persuaded mr harvey and mr conwick to partner with him to buy it for a similar timeshare the friend saidmr conwick and mr harvey declined to discuss the partnership but since  the walden group has been trying to sell the property and few neighbors know who owns it“they’re very protective of their fishing” said dawn murphy  who said she was one of only a few yearround residents nearbybut down the gravel road from ms murphy’s cabin a man outside a ranch house identified himself as the river property’s caretaker“i’m one of maybe half a dozen people in this valley who know of neil gorsuch” he saidthen emphasizing that he was a former law enforcement official he asked a reporter to leave correction march   because of an editing error an earlier version of this article
