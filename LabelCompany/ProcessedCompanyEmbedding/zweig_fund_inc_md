appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations furthermore an audit committees considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of a funds financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally

identified and evaluated based on the criteria and through the process described below members of the nominating committee as well as other board members may identify potential candidates shareholders also may propose nominees pursuant to each funds bylaws the evaluation process does not depend on the source of the recommendation it is expected that all candidates for the board will possess the following minimum qualifications i unquestioned personal integrity ii sound business judgment and iii the commitment required to be an effective director including without limitation the ability to attend meetings regularly the nominating committee takes into consideration such other factors as it deems appropriate except as provided above in nominating candidates each nominating committee does not believe that certain qualifications are controlling or paramount or that specific qualifications or skills are necessary for a candidate to possess pursuant to policies and procedures contained in the nominating committee charter when assessing the qualifications of a potential nominee or independent director the nominating committee considers such factors as it may deem relevant including whether the candidates background    skills and experience will complement the background skills and experience of other nominees and contribute to the diversity of the board these policies and procedures for identifying and evaluating candidates are implemented through discussion among nominating committee members each nominating committee may determine that a candidate who does not have all the qualifications referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the nominating committee finds that the candidates qualifications taken as a whole demonstrate an equivalent level of qualification to serve as a director each fund has adopted a policy requiring that any person whose seventyfifth th birthday would occur during such persons term of service as a director may

fund is subject to a number of risks including investment compliance operational and valuation risks among others risk oversight forms part of each boards general oversight of the respective fund and is addressed as part of various board and committee activities daytoday risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the adviser and other service providers depending on the nature of the risk who carry out the funds investment management and business affairs each of the adviser and other service providers have their own independent interest in risk management and their policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions business model and compliance structure as a result the board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect a fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate the occurrence or effects of all of such risks as part of its regular oversight of the funds the respective board directly or through a committee interacts with and reviews reports from among others the adviser and its officers and employees each funds chief compliance officer and the independent registered public accounting firm for the fund as appropriate that include risks faced by the fund and applicable risk functions the board may at any time and in its discretion change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight the board leadership structure george r aylward an interested person of each fund serves as each funds chairman of the board chief executive officer and president mr aylwards combined role as chairman chief executive officer and president promotes unified leadership and direction for each funds board of directors and executive management and allows for a single clear focus for the chain of command to execute each funds initiatives and plans the independent directors have designated two colead independent directors of each fund wendy luscombe and r keith walton the colead independent directors roles are defined as follows        chair meetings or executive sessions of the independent directors      review and comment on each boards meeting agendas      represent the views of the independent directors to management and      facilitate communication among the independent directors and their counsel as noted each board has established an executive committee a nominating committee and an audit committee to assist each board in the oversight and    direction of the business and affairs of each fund and from time to time may establish informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of each fund with respect to certain specified matters the board of each fund has determined that the boards leadership structure is appropriate for that fund taking into account that funds specific characteristics and circumstances in light of the fact that i all of the directors except the chairman are independent ii it provides for oversight of the business operations of the fund by experienced independent directors with two colead independent directors and separate committee chairmen iii by having mr aylward in the combined role as chairman chief executive officer and president it allows for unified leadership and direction for each funds board of directors and executive management iv by having two colead independent directors it helps to ensure timely communication between management and the independent directors and among the independent directors v it allows the board to exercise informed and independent judgment over the matters under its purview and specific to that fund vi it strikes an effective balance between management and independent director participation in the board process and vii it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of each boards members and the full board in a manner that enhances effective oversight shareholder communications any shareholder that

q fund distributions and managed distribution plan the fund has a managed distribution plan to pay  of the funds net asset value on an annualized basis distributions may represent earnings from net investment income realized capital gains or if necessary return of capital the board believes that regular quarterly fixed cash payouts will enhance shareholder value and serve the longterm interests of shareholders you should not draw any conclusions about the funds investment performance from the amount of the distributions or from the terms of the funds managed distribution plan the fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date therefore a portion of your distributions may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the funds investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income the amounts and sources of distributions reported in section a notices of the  act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the funds investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund will send shareholders a form div for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes the board may amend suspend or terminate the managed distribution plan at any time without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the fund and its shareholders information on

the increased optimism is no surprise they may be right from august to october our sentiment indicators registered a lot of pessimism while some of our current indicators still include some pretty bad numbers our sentiment model reading overall is now neutral among our other models the monetary reading is bullish thats because the fed has driven interest rates to zero and is buying securities however we wonder how bullish it can really be when rates are at zero as far as the tape is concerned we consider the current action quite positive its difficult to know the tapes actual performance because of the distortions caused by the computer traders who account for more than half of the volume there are far more unusual up and down days than we have seen in the past taking a long view the tape is acting reasonably well our stance on the market at this writing is somewhat bullish and we are about  to  long for our fund any investment figure over  is bullish sincerely smartin e zweig phd

prices in active markets for identical securities  level   prices determined using other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc  level   prices determined using significant unobservable inputs including the valuation committees own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments a description of the valuation techniques applied to the funds major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis is as follows equity securities are valued at the official closing price typically last sale on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded or if no closing price is available at the last bid price and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy restricted equity securities and private placements that are not widely traded are illiquid or are internally fair valued by the valuation committee are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy  certain foreign securities may be fair valued in cases where closing prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available market prices for example significant events such as movement in the us securities market or other regional and local developments may occur between the time that foreign markets close where the security is principally traded and the time that the fund calculates its net asset value generally the close of the nyse that may impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets in such cases the fund fair values foreign securities using an external pricing service which considers the correlation of the trading patterns of the foreign security to the intraday trading in the us markets for investments such as american depositary receipts financial futures exchangetraded funds and certain indexes as well as prices for similar securities such fair valuations are categorized as level  in the hierarchy because the frequency of significant events is not predictable fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a frequent basis debt securities including restricted securities are valued based on evaluated quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities for most bond types the pricing service utilizes matrix pricing which considers yield or price of bonds of comparable quality coupon maturity current cash flows type and current day trade information as well as dealer supplied prices these valuations are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy structured debt instruments such as mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities may also incorporate collateral analysis and utilize cash flow models for valuation and are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy pricing services do not provide pricing for all securities and therefore dealer supplied prices are utilized representing indicative bids based on pricing models used by market makers in the security and are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy debt securities that are not widely traded are illiquid or are internally fair valued by the valuation committee are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy listed derivatives such as options that are actively traded are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy over the counter otc derivative contracts which include forward currency contracts and equity linked instruments are valued based on inputs observed from actively quoted markets and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy investments in openend mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset value determined as of the close of business of the new york stock exchange generally  pm eastern time each business day and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy shortterm notes having a remaining maturity of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market and are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy a summary of the inputs used to value the funds major categories of assets and liabilities which primarily include investments of the fund by each major security type is disclosed at the end of the schedule of investments for the fund the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities b security transactions and related income security transactions are recorded on the trade date dividend income is

potential conflicts of interests there may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in connection with the mr neels and mr dickersons management of each funds investments and the

which is designed to be competitive in light of the individuals experience and responsibilities base salary is determined using compensation survey results of investment industry compensation conducted by an independent third party in evaluating competitive market compensation for its investment management professionals incentive bonus annual incentive payments are based on targeted compensation levels adjusted based on profitability investment performance factors and a subjective assessment of contribution to the team effort the shortterm incentive payment is generally paid in cash but a portion may be made in virtus rsus individual payments are assessed using comparisons of actual investment performance with specific peer group or index measures performance of the funds managed is generally measured over one three and five year periods and an individual managers participation is based on the performance of each fundaccount managed while portfolio manager compensation contains a performance component this component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary risk this approach ensures that investment management personnel remain focused on managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a funds mandate and risk profile and are discouraged from taking on more risk and unnecessary exposure to chase performance for personal gain we believe we have appropriate controls in place to handle any potential conflicts that may result from a substantial portion of portfolio manager compensation being tied to performance other benefits portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broadbased plans offered generally to employees of virtus and its affiliates
