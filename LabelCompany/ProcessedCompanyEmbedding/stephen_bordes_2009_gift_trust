trust relationship you can say the wrong thing and people will still get your meaning in a low trust relationship you can be very measured even precise and theyll still misinterpret you you dont need to look far to realize that as a global society we have a crisis of trust on our hands low trust is everywhere on the organizational level trust within companies has sharply declined but relationships of all kinds are built on and sustained by trust they can also be broken down and destroyed by a lack of trust society organizations and relationships aside theres an even more fundamental and powerful dimension to self trust if we cant trust ourselves well have a hard time trusting others personal incongruence is often the source of our suspicions of others economics of trust trust always affects two outcomes speed and cost when trust goes down speed goes down and cost goes up consider the time and cost of airport security after  or costs for sarbanesoxley act compliance passed in the us in response to enron worldcom and other corporate scandals when trust goes up speed goes up and cost goes down warren buffet completed the acquisition of mclane distribution from walmart on the basis of a twohour meeting because of high trust between the parties the merger took less than a month and avoided the usual months and millions for due diligence and attorneys the serious practical impact of the economics of trust is that we are paying a hidden lowtrust tax right off the top  and we dont even know it a company can have an excellent strategy and a strong ability to execute but the net result can be torpedoed by a lowtrust tax or multiplied by a hightrust dividend this makes a powerful business case for trust assuring that it is not a soft nice to have quality one of the reasons this hidden variable is so significant in todays world is that we have entered a global knowledge worker economy that revolves around partnering and relationships the ability to establish grow extend and restore trust with all stakeholders  customers suppliers and coworkers  is the key leadership competency of the new global economy inspiring trust trust is a whole life choice and until you are actually in a front line situation you will not even see the full power of the cores and behaviors on speed cost and trust look immediately for ways to apply them and find opportunities to teach them to others you will see how the of speed of trust the profits of the economics of trust the relevance of the pervasive impact of trust and the dividends of trust can significantly enhance the quality of every relationship on every level of your life you may still be hesitant or fearful when it comes to actually extending trust but leaders who extend trust become mentors models and heroes inspiring trust is the prime differentiator between a manager and a leader and the prime motivator of successful enterprises and relationships companies that choose to extend trust to their employees become great places to work children develop character and competence in the care of parents who love them believe in them and trust them most people respond well to trust and do not abuse it we are all born with a propensity to trust and choosing to retain or restore that propensity is key to our ability to forgive we have countless opportunities to extend and inspire trust to others but it also makes a difference in our own lives trust is reciprocal copyright   soundview executive book summariessoundview summary from the publisher covey convincingly validates our experience at dell  that

not fast youre dead  jack welch ill never forget an experience i had several years ago when i worked for a short stint with a major investment banking firm in new york city we had just come out of a very exhausting meeting during which it had become evident that there were serious internal trust issues these issues were slowing things down and negatively affecting execution the senior leader said to me privately these meetings are dysfunctional and a waste of time i just dont trust mike i dont trust ellen in fact i find it hard to trust anyone in this group i said well why dont you work on increasing trust he turned to me and replied seriously look stephen you need to understand something either you have trust or you dont we dont have it and theres nothing we can do about it i strongly disagree in fact both my personal life and my work as a business practitioner over the past  years have convinced me that there is a lot we can do about it we can increase trust  much faster than we might think  and doing so will have a huge impact both in the quality of our lives and in the results were able to achieve trust issues affect everyone as i speak to audiences around the world about the speed of trust i repeatedly hear expressions of frustration and discouragement such as these i cant stand the politics at work i feel sabotaged by my peers it seems like everyone is out for himself and will do anything to get ahead ive really been burned in the past how can i ever trust anyone enough to have a real relationship i work in an organization thats bogged down with bureaucracy it takes forever to get anything done i have to get authorization to buy a pencil the older my children get the less they listen to me what can i do i feel like my contributions at work are hardly ever recognized or valued i foolishly violated the trust of someone who was supremely important to me if i could hit rewind and make the decision differently i would do it in a heartbeat but i cant will i ever be able to rebuild the relationship i have to walk on eggshells at work if i say what i really think ill get fired    or at least made irrelevant my boss micromanages me and everyone else at work he treats us all like we cant be trusted with all the scandals corruption and ethical violations in our society today i feel like someone has pulled the rug out from under me i dont know what  or who  to trust anymore so what do you do if youre in a situation like one of these  or in any situation where a lack of trust creates politics and bureaucracy or simply slows things down do you merely accept this as the cost of doing business or can you do something to counteract or even reverse it i affirm that you can do something about it in fact by learning how to establish grow extend and restore trust you can positively and significantly alter the trajectory of this and every future moment of your life getting a handle on trust so what is trust rather than giving a complex definition i prefer to use the words of jack welch former ceo of general electric he said you know it when you feel it simply put trust means confidence the opposite of trust  distrust  is suspicion when you trust people you have confidence in them  in their integrity and in their abilities when you distrust people you are suspicious of them  of their integrity their agenda their capabilities or their track record its that simple we have all had experiences that validate the difference between relationships that are built on trust and those that are not these experiences clearly tell us the difference is not small it is dramatic take a minute right now and think of a person with whom you have a high trust relationship  perhaps a boss coworker customer spouse parent sibling child or friend describe this relationship whats it like how does it feel how well do you communicate how quickly can you get things done how much do you enjoy this relationship now think of a person with whom you have a lowtrust relationship again this person could be anyone at work or at home describe this relationship whats it like how does it feel how is the communication does it flow quickly and freely    or do you feel like youre constantly walking on land mines and being misunderstood do you work together to get things done quickly    or does it take a disproportionate amount of time and energy to finally reach agreement and execution do you enjoy this relationship    or do you find it tedious cumbersome and draining the difference between a high and lowtrust relationship is palpable take communication in a hightrust relationship you can say the wrong thing and people will still get your meaning in a lowtrust relationship you can be very measured even precise and theyll still misinterpret you can you even begin to imagine the difference it would make if you were able to increase the amount of trust in the important personal and professional relationships in your life the crucible one of the most formative experiences ive had personally in increasing trust occurred several years ago as a result of the merger between franklin quest and covey leadership center to form franklincovey company as anyone who has ever been through a merger or an acquisition will know these things are never easy the merged company had terrific strengths we had great people superb content loyal clients and productive tools but the blending of the two cultures was proving to be enormously challenging as president of the training and education business unit i had traveled to washington dc to address about a third of our consultants on the topic of our divisions strategy but a meeting that should have had me looking forward with anticipation literally had my stomach churning several weeks before the companys new ceo  frustrated as we all were with the enormous problems and friction that had beset what had seemed to be a promising merger  had scheduled a meeting of all the consultants in the company in an effort to get out everyones concerns he had created a format in which we as leaders were to listen but could not respond to anything anyone wanted to say the meeting scheduled to last four hours turned into a hour dump session with no one allowed to amend correct give context supply missing information discuss the other side of the issues or even show the dilemmas involved only a small percentage of what was said had real contextual accuracy most was misinterpreted manipulated or twisted and some of it was flatout wrong there were assumptions suspicions accusations frustrations and as leaders we had reluctantly agreed to a format in which we werent permitted to say a word in the end wed had over a dozen such meetings the whole experience had been brutal and with my position of leadership i had taken it all personally having had some experience on wall street i knew mergers were usually hard but i had thought we could do what needed to be done to make this one work the problem was that i had assumed far too much mistakenly i had failed to focus on establishing trust with the newly merged company believing that my reputation and credibility would already be known but they werent and as a result half the people trusted me and the other half didnt and it was pretty much divided right down covey or franklin party lines those from the covey side who knew me and had worked with me basically saw my decisions as a sincere effort to use objective external criteria in every decision and to do what was best for the business  not to try to push a covey agenda    in fact sometimes even bending over backward to avoid it those who didnt know me hadnt worked with me and didnt trust me interpreted every decision in the exact opposite manner in one case for example a question had come up concerning the use of the sundance resort for one of our leadership development programs sundance had been somewhat hard to work with and some felt we should move the program to another venue the program director strongly wanted to keep it at sundance because clients loved the location and the financial data showed that we were averaging nearly  percent more revenue per program held there compared to other venues i said because the economics are better and the program director strongly recommends that we keep it there well find better ways to work with sundance that was an example of a solid business decision i assumed people would understand but those who didnt trust me didnt understand they thought i was trying to push a covey approach some even wondered if i was getting some kind of kickback because as a community leader i had been asked to serve in an unpaid role on the advisory board for the sundance childrens theater many suspected my motive because there was such low trust the feeling was theres got to be some kind of hidden agenda going on here in another situation i had made the decision to move ron an extremely talented leader who had come from the covey side into a different position because like many of us he had gotten caught in merger politics and had polarized the two camps i had decided to go outside the organization for rons replacement so that there would be no perception that the new manager was a covey person or a franklin person when i made this announcement i thought people would be excited by my attempt to bring in new talent but among those who didnt trust me no one even heard the part about bringing in someone from the outside to replace ron as manager all they heard was that he was still in the company and they wanted him gone time after time my actions had been misinterpreted and my motives questioned even though i had involved both covey and franklin camps in making decisions as you might imagine some who had no idea of my track record and results had assumed that the only reason i was in my position of leadership was simply that i was stephen r coveys son and that i had no credibility on my own as a result of all this id had to make decisions much more slowly i tried to project how every decision would be interpreted by each of the cultures i began to worry about baggage and risk i started playing a political game that id never played before  one that i never had to play before because it had never been part of who i was as i thought about everything that had transpired i came to the realization that if i didnt take the tough issues headon the current situation would simply perpetuate itself  probably even get worse my every decision would be secondguessed and politicized getting anything done would be like trying to move through molasses we were facing increasing bureaucracy politics and disengagement this was wasting enormous amounts of time energy and money the cost was significant besides i thought given how badly things were going what did i have to lose so when i walked into the consultant meeting that day in washington dc i basically said look were at this meeting to talk about strategy and if thats what you want to talk about thats what well talk about but if you would rather talk about the merger issues that are really on your minds well talk about those well talk about any of the tough questions you have whos staying and whos going whos making what decisions what criteria are being used why arent we more informed what if we dont trust those making the decisions what if we dont trust you stephen to make some of these decisions at first people were stunned that i would bring up these difficult issues including their perception of me many were also wondering what my real agenda was but they soon realized that i wasnt hiding anything i was being transparent and candid they could tell i genuinely wanted to open things up as the meeting progressed they could see that i wasnt operating from any hidden agenda i was sincerely trying to do what was right for the business as it turned out the scheduled onehour strategy meeting turned into a full days discussion of their concerns whose buildings were we going to use which compensation plan would we adapt whose sales model would we use are you stephen really competent to make these decisions what is your track record what are your criteria i openly acknowledged that these were challenging issues i candidly shared the thinking and rationale behind the decisions and the process by which they were made or were being made i shared all the data i could share and if i couldnt share it i explained why i listened and sought to understand their concerns based on their recommendations i made several commitments around improvements at the end of the day there was a renewed feeling of hope and excitement one participant told me that i had established more trust in one day than i had in the prior several months more than anything else i realized it was a starting place an acknowledgment of the value of our transparent communication i also realized that the real test however would be on how i followed through at least now people could see my behavior through new eyes not tainted by the lens of low trust word from this meeting spread and within the next few months i was able to meet with the other consultants and go through the same process with the same results i followed a similar course with other groups and divisions in a very short period of time we were able to establish trust with our entire business unit as far as my unit was concerned this increased trust dramatically changed everything we were able to increase speed lower cost and improve results in all areas though i eventually left franklincovey to start my own company and write this book i am happy to report that they have weathered the storms created by the merger and are now doing very well on a personal basis the whole experience helped me to understand trust far more clearly than in premerger times when trust was high and things were good first i learned that i had assumed way too much i assumed i had trust with people when in fact i didnt i assumed that people were aware of my track record and covey leadership centers track record which they were not i assumed that because i was teeing up the tough issues in my private meetings and making decisions based on objective business criteria this was being reported down line but it was not i also learned that i had been politically naïve yes i made mistakes but i didnt make the mistakes i was being accused of making the most significant mistake i made was in not being more proactive in establishing and increasing trust as a result i experienced firsthand both the social and the hard bottomline economic consequences of low trust in addition i learned that trust truly does change everything once you create trust  genuine character and competencebased trust  almost everything else falls into place a crisis of trust you dont need to look far to realize that as a global society we have a crisis of trust on our hands consider recent newspaper headlines  employees new motto trust no one  companies urged to rebuild trust  both sides betray the others trust   nyse traders indicted  ethics must be strengthened to rebuild peoples trust  relationships fall apart as trust dwindles  now who do you trust news headlines reveal the symptoms of the compelling truth low trust is everywhere it permeates our global society our marketplace our organizations our relationships our personal lives it breeds suspicion and cynicism which become selfperpetuating resulting in a costly downward cycle consider our society at large trust in almost every societal institution government media business health care churches political parties etc is significantly lower than a generation ago and in many cases sits at historic lows in the united states for example a  harris poll revealed that only  of those surveyed tend to trust the media only  trust political parties only  trust the government and only  trust big companies perhaps even more telling is the loss of trust with regard to people trusting other people a recent survey conducted by british sociologist david halpern reveals that only  of americans believe that other people can be trusted in latin america the number is only  and in africa the figure is  halperns research also shows that four decades ago in great britain  of the population believed other people could be trusted today its down to  the good news of this study  relatively speaking  is that  of scandinavians denmark sweden and norway and  of the people in the netherlands believe others can be trusted indicating that there are some highertrust societies and mexicos figure  though a low   is up from s  which indicates that it is possible to increase societal trust on the organizational level trust within companies has also sharply declined just look at what the research shows  only  of employees have trust and confidence in senior management  only  of employees believe their leaders act with honesty and integrity  over the past  months  of employees have observed illegal or unethical conduct on the job  conduct which if exposed would seriously violate the public trust what about trust at the personal relationship level while this naturally varies with regard to particular relationships trust is a major issue for most people in at least some relationships and too often with their most significant relationships such as with a boss or coworker or a spouse or child at home consider the following  the number one reason people leave their jobs is a bad relationship with their boss  one out of every two marriages ends in divorce relationships of all kinds are built on and sustained by trust they can also be broken and destroyed by lack of trust try to imagine any meaningful relationship without trust in fact low trust is the very definition of a bad relationship what about trust at the individual level consider the percentage of students who acknowledged that they cheated in order to improve their odds of getting into graduate school  liberal arts students    education students    medical students    law students    business students   how does it make you feel to know that theres more than a  chance that the doctor whos going to perform surgery on you cheated in school or a  chance that the company youre going to work for is being led by someone who didnt consider honesty important recently when i presented this data to a group of attorneys they were thrilled to find out that they were not in last place and they chided me because  with my mba  i was it didnt help when i further pointed out that  of mbas were willing to understate expenses that cut into their profits and that convicts in minimumsecurity prisons scored as high as mba students on their ethical dilemma exams talk about a crisis of trust society organizations and relationships aside theres an even more fundamental and powerful dimension to self trust often we make commitments to ourselves  such as setting goals or making new years resolutions  that we fail to fulfill as a result we come to feel that we cant even fully trust ourselves if we cant trust ourselves well have a hard time trusting others this personal incongruence is often the source of our suspicions of others as my father has often said we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior this is why as well discuss later one of the fastest ways to restore trust is to make and keep commitments  even very small commitments  to ourselves and to others truly we are in a crisis of trust it affects us on all levels  societal institutional organizational relational and personal  and it has a perpetuating effect while many of us may be fairly resilient with each new violation of trust or corporate scandal we tend to recover a little more slowly we wonder what else is out there we become increasingly suspicious of other people we begin to project the behavior of the few upon the many and we are paying for it dearly the economics of trust a cynic might ask so what is trust really more than a nicetohave social virtue a socalled hygiene factor can you measurably illustrate that trust is a hardedged economic driver i intend to answer these questions emphatically in this book by clearly demonstrating the strong business case for trust heres a simple formula that will enable you to take trust from an intangible and unquantifiable variable to an indispensable factor that is both tangible and quantifiable the formula is based on this critical insight trust always affects two outcomes  speed and cost when trust goes down speed will also go down and costs will go up when trust goes up speed will also go up and costs will go down its that simple that real that predictable let me share a couple of examples immediately following the  terrorist attacks our trust in flying in the us went down dramatically we recognized that there were terrorists bent on harming us and that our system of ensuring passenger safety was not as strong as it needed to be prior to  i used to arrive at my home airport approximately half an hour before takeoff and i was quickly able to go through security but after  more robust procedures and systems were put in place to increase safety and trust in flying while these procedures have had their desired effect now it takes me longer and costs me more to travel i generally arrive an hour and a half before a domestic flight and two to three hours before an international flight to make sure i have enough time to clear security i also pay a new  security tax with every ticket i buy so as trust went down speed also went down and cost went up recently i flew out of a major city in a highrisk area in the middle east for geopolitical reasons the trust in that region was extremely low i had to arrive at the airport four hours before my flight i went through several screenings and my bag was unpacked and searched multiple times by multiple people and every other passenger was treated the same clearly extra security measures were necessary and in this instance i was grateful for them but the point remains the same because trust was low speed went down and cost went up consider another example the sarbanesoxley act was passed in the us in response to the enron worldcom and other corporate scandals while it appears that sarbanesoxley may be having a positive effect in improving or at least sustaining trust in the public markets it is also clear that this has come at a substantial price ask any ceo cfo or financial person in a company subject to sarbanesoxley rules about the amount of time it takes to follow its regulations as well as the added cost of doing so its enormous on both fronts in fact a recent study pegged the costs of implementing one section alone at  billion  exceeding the original sec estimate by  times compliance regulations have become a prosthesis for the lack of trust  and a slowmoving and costly prosthesis at that again we come back to the key learning when trust is low speed goes down and cost goes up on the other hand when trust is high speed goes up and cost goes down consider the example of warren buffett  ceo of berkshire hathaway and generally considered one of the most trusted leaders in the world  who recently completed a major acquisition of mclane distribution a  billion company from walmart as public companies both berkshire hathaway and walmart are subject to all kinds of market and regulatory scrutiny typically a merger of this size would take several months to complete and cost several million dollars to pay for accountants auditors and attorneys to verify and validate all kinds of information but in this instance because both parties operated with high trust the deal was made with one twohour meeting and a handshake in less than a month it was completed in a management letter that accompanied his  annual report warren buffett wrote we did no due diligence we knew everything would be exactly as walmart said it would be  and it was imagine  less than one month instead of six months or longer and no due diligence costs instead of the millions typically spent high trust high speed low cost consider the example of another legendary leader herb kelleher chairman and former ceo of southwest airlines in robert k cooper and ayman sawafs book executive eq the authors share a remarkable story walking down the hall one day gary barron  then executive vice president of the  million maintenance organization for all southwest  presented a threepage summary memo to kelleher outlining a proposal for a massive reorganization on the spot kelleher read the memo he asked one question to which baron responded that he shared the concern and was dealing with it kelleher then replied then its fine by me go ahead the whole interaction took about four minutes not only was kelleher a trusted leader he also extended trust to others he trusted barrons character and his competence and because he trusted that barron knew what he was doing the company could move with incredible speed heres another example on a much smaller scale jim a vendor in new york city set up shop and sold donuts and coffee to passersby as they went in and out of their office buildings during the breakfast and lunch hours jim always had long lines of customers waiting he noticed that the wait time discouraged many customers who left and went elsewhere he also noticed that as he was a oneman show the biggest bottleneck preventing him from selling more donuts and coffee was the disproportionate amount of time it took to make change for his customers finally jim simply put a small basket on the side of his stand filled with dollar bills and coins trusting his customers to make their own change now you might think that customers would accidentally count wrong or intentionally take extra quarters from the basket but what jim found was the opposite most customers responded by being completely honest often leaving him largerthannormal tips also he was able to move customers through at twice the pace because he didnt have to make change in addition he found that his customers liked being trusted and kept coming back by extending trust in this way jim was able to double his revenues without adding any new cost again when trust is low speed goes down and cost goes up when trust is high speed goes up and cost goes down copyright   coveylink llc show more what people are saying about this from the
