changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to

principal payments we may have to invest the proceeds from prepaid investments including mortgage backed investments in other investments with less attractive terms and yields interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond

because each fund pursues its own unique investment objectives each fund has its own set of risks which are fully discussed in its prospectus in order to achieve their investment objectives some funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps these instruments involve risks different from and in certain cases greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments for funds that can invest in foreign securities which may include emerging markets securities risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to decreasing bond prices as interest rates rise and increasing bond prices as interest rates fall the values of mortgage related securities and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk in addition a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline funds that invest in debt securities issued by state or local governments may be subject to special political legal economic and market factors that can have a significant effect on the

interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using
